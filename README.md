Purpose
=======

This repository houses tidy datasets for the following catalogs and
collections of mythology and folklore, for use in discovery of patterns
using natural language processing and others statistical methods. The
following datasets are located in the `/data` sub-folder:

-   `tmi`, *the Thompson Motif Index*:
-   `atu`, *the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Tale Type Index*:
-   `aat`, *Ashlimanâ€™s annotated tales*:

Replication
===========

For the purposes of reproducibility and continual methodological
improvement, we have made available the scripts used to obtain these
datasets from online in the `fetch/` subfolder. The `tmi` dataset was
built with the `fetch_motifs.R` script, the `atu` with the
`fetch_taletypes.R` script, and the `aat` with the
`fetch_ashliman.R`script. If you find issues with any of the datasets or
scripts, please file an issue on this repository. If you make
improvements to the scripts, please consider submitting a pull request.
