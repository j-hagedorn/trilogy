Based on the documentation included [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio). Assumes that Python (using Miniconda) has been installed.

1.  *In terminal*: Ensure that installation of Python has the virtualenv package installed by running: `pip install virtualenv`
2.  *In terminal*: Navigate into RStudio project directory using: `cd "C:/Users/joshh/Documents/GitHub/trilogy"`
3.  *In terminal*: Create new virtual environment in a folder called `my_env` within project directory using the following command: `virtualenv my_env`
4.  *In terminal*: Activate the `virtualenv` in current project using the following command: `source my_env/bin/activate`
5.  *In terminal*: Install packages `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib spacy pytextrank gensim notebook stanza spacy_stanza`
6.  *In terminal*: Load English tokenizer, tagger, parser and NER with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
6.  *In console*: Install package `install.packages("reticulate")`
7.  Configure `reticulate` to point to the Python executable in your `virtualenv` by creating an `.Rprofile` file in your project directory, with the following contents: `Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "my_env/bin/python")`
