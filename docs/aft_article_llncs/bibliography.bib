	abstract = {Sustainably managing common natural resources, such as fisheries, water, and forests, is essential for our long-term survival. Many analysts have assumed, however, that people will maximize short-term self-benefits—for example, by cutting as much firewood as they can sell—and warned that this behavior will inevitably produce a “tragedy of the commons” (1), such as a stripped forest that no longer produces wood for anyone. But in laboratory simulations of such social dilemmas, the outcome is not always tragedy. Instead, a basic finding is that humans do not universally maximize short-term self-benefits, and can cooperate to produce shared, long-term benefits (2, 3). Similar findings have come from field studies of commonly managed resources (6–7). It has been challenging, however, to directly relate laboratory findings to resource conditions in the field, and identify the conditions that enhance cooperation. On page 961 of this issue, Rustagi et al. (8) help fill this gap. In an innovative study of Ethiopia's Oromo people, they use economic experiments and forest growth data to show that groups that had a higher proportion of “conditional cooperators” were more likely to invest in forest patrols aimed at enforcing firewood collection rules—and had more productive forests. They also show that other factors, including a group's distance to markets and the quality of its leadership, influenced the success of cooperative management.  In Ethiopia, groups with a higher propensity to cooperate avoid the tragedy of the commons.},

Tendencies in the areal spread of motifs are interpreted as proxies for the  intensity  of  information  exchange  between  people.  Two  regularities  in  distribution  of  motifs deserve attention. Western Europe and the Mediterranean with adjacent Africa are contrasted  with  the  Caucasus,  Central  Asia  and  Mongolia  with  adjacent  Siberia.  Finnish,  Estonian,   Latvian,   Lithuanian,   Byelorussian   and   Ukrainian   traditions   are   strongly   “European”,  the  folklore  of  the  Crimea  Tatars  and  especially  of  the  Bashkir  is  strongly  “Asiatic”, the folklore of the Gagauz, Volga Tatars, Mari, Udmurts and Komi moderately “Asiatic”,  the  Russians,  the  Setu,  the  Karelians  and  the  Mordvinians  are  slightly  on  the  “European” side while the Chuvash are slightly on the “Asiatic” side. Other set of motifs contrasts Siberian, Eastern European and Baltic traditions with the Mediterranean – South Asian ones. The northern set of motifs seems to have origins as deep in time as the early Holocene. The southern one largely correlates with the spread of Islam but can have some roots in the early civilizations of Western Eurasia.},

STM allows Humanities scholars to discover unknown passages from the vast sea of works that Moretti calls the “great unread” and to significantly increase the researcher's ability to discuss aspects of influence and the development of intellectual movements across a broader swath of the literary landscape. In this article, we test three typical Humanities research problems: in the first, a researcher wants to find text passages that exhibit similarities to a collection of influential non literary texts from a single author (here, Darwin); in the second, a researcher wants to discover literary passages related to a well understood corpus of literary texts (here, emblematic texts from the Modern Breakthrough); and in the third, a researcher hopes to understand the influence that a particular domain (here, folklore) has had on the realm of literature over a series of decades. We explore these research challenges with three experiments.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, a catalogue of folklore and mythology has been created which now contains approximately 50,000 abstracts of texts from all over the world, with information on the distributions of more than 2000 motifs from almost 1000 traditions. In this chapter, we describe this databank and use it to analyse the distribution of motifs across the New World as well as distributions of selected motifs worldwide. Our results support the hypothesis of a coastal route from Beringia to the territories beyond the ice sheets at the early stage of the peopling of America ca. 15–17,000 years ago. Not only do stark differences exist between sets of motifs recorded in North America, on the one hand, and in Central and South America, on the other hand, but these sets find parallels in different regions of the Old World. The Central-South American set has analogies in the Indo-Pacific belt of Asia, especially in Melanesia. Motifs in North America rather often find parallels in continental Siberia. Because all groups of migrants, from the earliest to the Inuit Eskimo, penetrated North America, but few crossed the deserts of Northern Mexico and the Central American bottleneck, the North American folklore traditions accumulated a greater variety of stories and images and are amongst the richest in the world. South American traditions, in contrast, are more homogeneous. Besides this North–South American dichotomy, other regularities in the geographic distribution of folklore motifs in the New World are revealed. In particular, they are related to the presence of different sets of motifs across the South American southwest and east; to the east and to the west of the Rockies; across the North American northwest and across the main part of the continent. These patterns of distribution of motifs can be correlated with archaeological data.},

This led us to focus on making those newly generated formal knowledge sources available in a few more languages, like German, Russian and Bulgarian.

  abstract = {Researchers have long been fascinated by the strong continuities evident in the oral traditions associated with different cultures. According to the ?historic-geographic? school, it is possible to classify similar tales into ?international types? and trace them back to their original archetypes. However, critics argue that folktale traditions are fundamentally fluid, and that most international types are artificial constructs. Here, these issues are addressed using phylogenetic methods that were originally developed to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among biological species, and which have been recently applied to a range of cultural phenomena. The study focuses on one of the most debated international types in the literature: ATU 333, ?Little Red Riding Hood?. A number of variants of ATU 333 have been recorded in European oral traditions, and it has been suggested that the group may include tales from other regions, including Africa and East Asia. However, in many of these cases, it is difficult to differentiate ATU 333 from another widespread international folktale, ATU 123, ?The Wolf and the Kids?. To shed more light on these relationships, data on 58 folktales were analysed using cladistic, Bayesian and phylogenetic network-based methods. The results demonstrate that, contrary to the claims made by critics of the historic-geographic approach, it is possible to identify ATU 333 and ATU 123 as distinct international types. They further suggest that most of the African tales can be classified as variants of ATU 123, while the East Asian tales probably evolved by blending together elements of both ATU 333 and ATU 123. These findings demonstrate that phylogenetic methods provide a powerful set of tools for testing hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among folktales, and point towards exciting new directions for research into the transmission and evolution of oral narratives.}

	abstract = {This paper presents unprecedented evidence on the transmission mechanism underlying the spread of a broad cross-cultural assemblage of folktales in Eurasia and Africa. State-of-the-art genomic evidence is used to directly assess the relevance of demic diffusion processes, in particular on the distribution of Old World folktales at intermediate geographic scales, and identify individual stories that are more likely to be transmitted through population movement and replacement. The results provide an empirical solution to operate with linguistic barriers and highlight the impossibility of disentangling genetic from geographic relationships at a cross-continental scale, warning against the direct use of extant genetic variability to infer processes of long-range cultural transmission.Observable patterns of cultural variation are consistently intertwined with demic movements, cultural diffusion, and adaptation to different ecological contexts [Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (1981) Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach; Boyd and Richerson (1985) Culture and the Evolutionary Process]. The quantitative study of gene{\textendash}culture coevolution has focused in particular on the mechanisms responsible for change in frequency and attributes of cultural traits, the spread of cultural information through demic and cultural diffusion, and detecting relationships between genetic and cultural lineages. Here, we make use of worldwide whole-genome sequences [Pagani et al. (2016) Nature 538:238{\textendash}242] to assess the impact of processes involving population movement and replacement on cultural diversity, focusing on the variability observed in folktale traditions (n = 596) [Uther (2004) The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the System of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson] in Eurasia. We find that a model of cultural diffusion predicted by isolation-by-distance alone is not sufficient to explain the observed patterns, especially at small spatial scales (up to \~{}4,000 km). We also provide an empirical approach to infer presence and impact of ethnolinguistic barriers preventing the unbiased transmission of both genetic and cultural information. After correcting for the effect of ethnolinguistic boundaries, we show that, of the alternative models that we propose, the one entailing cultural diffusion biased by linguistic differences is the most plausible. Additionally, we identify 15 tales that are more likely to be predominantly transmitted through population movement and replacement and locate putative focal areas for a set of tales that are spread worldwide.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

	abstract = {Structural similarities across narratives play an important role in many areas of humanities research. In this article, we describe a methodology and an implementation to uncover such similarities automatically in two application scenarios. In both scenarios—ritual and folktale studies—existing research examines similarities of narratives on a structural level and discusses structural principles that govern the combination of individual events to tales or rituals. We present a largely unsupervised and fully automated alignment-based approach for the detection of structural similarities of narratives that allows for data-driven quantitative studies of narrative structure. Our approach makes use of an adaptable, computational linguistic processing architecture that creates integrated discourse representations of events, participants, and their relations. Our contributions are twofold and crucially build on the automatically constructed discourse representations: (1) We examine different ‘semantics-driven cross-document alignment’ algorithms that determine (sequences of) events shared between narratives, to support the search for recurrent elements in their structure. The alignment algorithms are evaluated in two experiments. (2) We develop ‘tools for exploration and interpretation’ that we offer to humanities researchers for investigation of the analyzed data. These include search facilities, visualizations, statistical overviews, and a graph-based algorithm that identifies densely aligned regions across documents for targeted inspection.},

We analyzed 219 types with 1202 motifs from the “Tales of magic” (types 300-749) segment to exemplify that motif sequences show signs of recombination in the storytelling process. Compared to chromosome mutations in genetics, we offer examples for insertion/deletion, duplication and, possibly, transposition, whereas the sample was not sufficient to find inverted motif strings as well. These initial findings encourage efforts to sequence motif strings like DNA in genetics, attempting to find for instance the longest common motif subsequences in tales. Expressing the network of motif connections by graphs suggests that tale plots as consolidated pathways of content help one memorize culturally engraved messages. We anticipate a connection between such networks and addington’s epigenetic landscape.},

To monitor semantic drifts within the observation period, an experiment was carried out on the term space of a collection of 12.8 million Amazon book reviews. For evaluation, the semantic consistency of ESOM term clusters was compared with their respective neighbourhoods in WordNet, and contrasted with distances among term vectors by random indexing. We found that at 0.05 level of significance, the terms in the clusters showed a high level of semantic consistency. Tracking the drift of distributional patterns in the term space across time periods, we found that consistency decreased, but not at a statistically significant level. Our method is highly scalable, with interpretations in philosophy.},

	abstract = {In this paper we utilize methods of hyperdimensional computing to mediate the identification of therapeutically useful connections for the purpose of literature-based discovery. Our approach, named Predication-based Semantic Indexing, is utilized to identify empirically sequences of relationships known as "discovery patterns", such as "drug x INHIBITS substance y, substance y CAUSES disease z" that link pharmaceutical substances to diseases they are known to treat. These sequences are derived from semantic predications extracted from the biomedical literature by the SemRep system, and subsequently utilized to direct the search for known treatments for a held out set of diseases. Rapid and efficient inference is accomplished through the application of geometric operators in PSI space, allowing for both the derivation of discovery patterns from a large set of known TREATS relationships, and the application of these discovered patterns to constrain search for therapeutic relationships at scale. Our results include the rediscovery of discovery patterns that have been constructed manually by other authors in previous research, as well as the discovery of a set of previously unrecognized patterns. The application of these patterns to direct search through PSI space results in better recovery of therapeutic relationships than is accomplished with models based on distributional statistics alone. These results demonstrate the utility of efficient approximate inference in geometric space as a means to identify therapeutic relationships, suggesting a role of these methods in drug repurposing efforts. In addition, the results provide strong support for the utility of the discovery pattern approach pioneered by Hristovski and his colleagues.},

We define three levels of complexity for folk narratives: the number of tale types, the number of narrative motifs, and, finally, the number of traits in variants of the same type, for two well-known tales for which we have data from previous studies. We found a positive relationship between number of tale types and population size, a negative relationship for the number of narrative motifs, and no relationship for the number of traits. The absence of a consistent relationship between population size and complexity in folktales provides a novel perspective on the current debates in cultural evolution. We propose that the link between cultural complexity and demography could be domain dependent: in some domains (e.g. technology) this link is important, whereas in others, such as folktales, complex traditions can be easily maintained in small populations as well as large ones, as they may appeal to universal cognitive biases.},

	abstract = {The evolution of fairy tales often involves complex interactions between oral and literary traditions, which can be difficult to tease apart when investigating their origins. Here, we show how computer-assisted stemmatology can be productively applied to this problem, focusing on a long-standing controversy in fairy tale scholarship: did Little Red Riding Hood originate as an oral tale that was adapted by Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, or is the oral tradition in fact derived from literary texts? We address this question by analysing a sample of twenty-four literal and oral versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood using several methods of phylogenetic analysis, including maximum parsimony and two network-based approaches (NeighbourNet and TRex). While the results of these analyses are more compatible with the oral origins hypothesis than the alternative literary origins hypothesis, their interpretation is problematized by the fact that none of them explicitly model lineal (i.e. ancestor-descendent) relationships among taxa. We therefore present a new likelihood-based method, PhyloDAG, which was specifically developed to model lineal as well as collateral and reticulate relationships. A comparison of different structures derived from PhyloDAG provided a much clearer result than the maximum parsimony, NeighbourNet or TRex analyses, and strongly favoured the hypothesis that literary versions of Little Red Riding Hood were originally based on oral folktales, rather than vice versa.},

The international folktale record has long been regarded as a rich context in which to explore these legacies. To date, investigations in this area have been complicated by a lack of historical data and the impact of more recent waves of diffusion. In this study, we introduce new methods for tackling these problems by applying comparative phylogenetic methods and autologistic modelling to analyse the relationships between folktales, population histories and geographical distances in Indo-European-speaking societies. We find strong correlations between the distributions of a number of folktales and phylogenetic, but not spatial, associations among populations that are consistent with vertical processes of cultural inheritance. Moreover, we show that these oral traditions probably originated long before the emergence of the literary record, and find evidence that one tale (?The Smith and the Devil?) can be traced back to the Bronze Age. On a broader level, the kinds of stories told in ancestral societies can provide important insights into their culture, furnishing new perspectives on linguistic, genetic and archaeological reconstructions of human prehistory.},

Two corpora of West African and Western European folk tales are compiled and used in three experiments on cross-cultural folk tale analysis. In the text generation experiment, two types of deep learning text generators are built and trained on the West African corpus. We show that although the texts range between semantic and syntactic coherence, each of them contains West African features. The second experiment further examines the distinction between the West African and Western European folk tales by comparing the performance of an LSTM (acc. 0.79) with a BoW classifier (acc. 0.93), indicating that the two corpora can be clearly distinguished in terms of vocabulary. An interactive t-SNE visualization of a hybrid classifier (acc. 0.85) highlights the culture-specific words for both. The third experiment describes an ML analysis of narrative structures. Classifiers trained on parts of folk tales according to the three-act structure are quite capable of distinguishing these parts (acc. 0.78). Common n-grams extracted from these parts not only underline cross-cultural distinctions in narrative structures, but also show the overlap between verbal and written West African narratives.},

mechanics. By using term distances as a measure of semantic relatedness vs.
their PageRank values indicating social importance and applied as variable
`term mass', gravitation as a metaphor to express changes in the semantic

`term gravitation' over time, one can compute its generating potential whose

Their recognition for document classification and retrieval is largely unresolved. Work on identifying rhetorical, narrative and persuasive elements in scientific texts has been progressing, in several, but largely unconnected tracks. The AMICUS project1 (running between 2009 and 2012) set out to test a possible way to resolve these issues, starting with the identification of Proppian functions in folk tale corpora and adapting the solution to the identification of tale motifs or their functional counterparts. AMICUS has devoted its first project year to listing the corpora, tools, methods and contacts available to address these issues. The initiators of the project have identified a common need in the processing of texts from both the cultural heritage (CH) and scientific communication (SC) domains: to perform automated, large-scale higher-order text analytics, i.e., to reach an advanced level of text understanding so that structured knowledge can be extracted from unstructured text. The four research groups propose to tackle an important aspect of this complex issue by investigating how linguistic elements convey motifs in texts from the CH and the SC domains. Our shared working hypothesis is that the identity of higherorder content-bearing elements, i.e., textual units that are typically designated for e.g. document indexing, classification, enrichment, and the like, strongly depends on community perception.},

Reasons for not sharing data are discussed and contrasted with advantages of sharing, which include abiding by the scientific principle of openness, keeping the data for posterity, increasing one's impact, facilitation of secondary analyses and collaborations, prevention and correction of errors, and meeting funding agencies' increasingly stringent stipulations concerning the dissemination of data. Practicing what they preach, the authors include data as an online appendix to this editorial. These data are from a cohort of psychology freshmen who completed Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, tests of Numerical Ability, Number Series, Hidden Figures, Vocabulary, Verbal Analogies, and Logical Reasoning, two Big Five personality inventories, and scales for social desirability and impression management. Student's sex and grade point average (GPA) are also included. Data could be used to study predictive validity of cognitive ability tests, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and the general factor of personality, as well as sex differences, differential prediction, and relations between personality and intelligence.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, data-driven methods have come to dominate many fields of scientific inquiry. Open data and open-source software have enabled the rapid implementation of novel methods to manage and analyze the growing flood of data. However, it has become apparent that many scientific fields exhibit distressingly low rates of reproducibility. Although there are many dimensions to this issue, we believe that there is a lack of formalism used when describing end-to-end published results, from the data source to the analysis to the final published results. Even when authors do their best to make their research and data accessible, this lack of formalism reduces the clarity and efficiency of reporting, which contributes to issues of reproducibility. Data provenance aids both reproducibility through systematic and formal records of the relationships among data sources, processes, datasets, publications and researchers.},

	abstract = {Objective
Use of reproducible research practices improves the quality of science and the speed of scientific development. We sought to understand use of reproducible research practices in public health and associated barriers and facilitators.

Methods
In late 2017, we surveyed members of the American Public Health Association Applied Public Health Statistics section and others; 247 of 278 who screened eligible answered the survey, and 209 answered every applicable question. The survey included questions about file management, code annotation and documentation, reproducibility of analyses, and facilitators and barriers of using reproducible practices.

Results
Just 14.4\% of participants had shared code, data, or both. Many participants reported their data (33\%) and code (43.2\%) would be difficult for colleagues to find if they left their institution. Top reported barriers to using reproducible practices were data privacy (49.8\%) and lack of time (41.7\%). Participants suggested training (50.9\%) and requirements by journals (44.4\%) and funders (40.2\%) to increase use of reproducible research practices.

Conclusions
Increasing use of reproducible research practices is important for public health and requires action from researchers, training programs, funders, and journals.},

To make the data and code available so that published results can be checked requires an archive. Top economics journals have been adopting mandatory data+code archives in the past few years. The movement toward mandatory data+code archives has yet to reach the open access journals. This is paradoxical; given their emphasis on making articles readily available, one would think that open access journals also would want to make data and code readily available. Open access economics journals should adopt mandatory data+code archives en masse. Doing so will give them a competitive advantage with respect to traditional economics journals.},
