","Once upon a time there was a poor woman who had a son who wanted very much to travel. His mother said, ""How can you travel? We have no money at all for you to take with you.""

Then the son said, ""I will take care of myself. I will always say, 'Not much, not much, not much.'""

So he walked for a long time, always saying, ""Not much, not much, not much.""

Then he came to a group of fishermen, and said, ""God be with you. Not much, not much, not much.""

""What do you say, fellow? Not much?""

And when they pulled up their net, they had not caught many fish. So one of them fell on the boy with a stick, saying, ""Have you ever seen me thrash?""

""What should I say, then?"" asked the boy.

""You should say, ""Catch a lot. Catch a lot.""

Then he again walked a long time, saying, ""Catch a lot. Catch a lot,"" until he came to a gallows, where they were about to hang a poor sinner. Then said he, ""Good morning. Catch a lot. Catch a lot.""

""What do you say, fellow? Catch a lot? Should there be even more wicked people in the world? Isn't this enough?"" And he again got it on his back.

""What should I say, then?"" he asked.

""You should say, ""May God comfort the poor soul.""

Again the boy walked on for a long while, saying, ""May God comfort the poor soul."" Then he came to a ditch where a knacker was skinning a horse. The boy said, ""Good morning. May God comfort the poor soul.""

""What do you say, you disgusting fellow?"" said the knacker, hitting him about the ears with his skinning hook until he could not see out of his eyes.

""What should I say, then?""

""You should say, 'Lie in the ditch, you carcass.'""

So he walked on, saying, ""Lie in the ditch, you carcass. Lie in the ditch, you carcass."" He came to a coach filled with people, and said, ""Lie in the ditch, you carcass.""

Then the coach tipped over into the ditch, and the driver took his whip and beat the boy until he had to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went traveling again.",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","Once upon a time there was a widow who had a son named Michel. One day she said to him, ""Michel, I can no longer provide for you. You must go to the village. And when you get there, you must say, 'A hundred every day! A hundred every day!'""

Michel said, ""I will do that.""

Upon his arrival in the village a funeral coach came his way, and he cried out, ""A hundred every day! A hundred every day!""

Then the pallbearers came and gave him a beating. Michel returned home and said to his mother, ""Mother, I got beaten up.""

His mother asked, ""Why?""

Michel replied, ""When I arrived in the village a funeral coach came my way, and I cried out, ""A hundred every day! A hundred every day! Then the pallbearers came and gave me a beating.""

""You did a bad thing,"" responded his mother. ""You should have cried and wrung your hands.""

""I can still do that,"" replied Michel.

When he arrived in the village again, a wedding coach came his way, so Michel sat down and cried and wrung his hands. Then the members of the wedding party came and gave him a beating.

Michel returned home again and said to his mother, ""I got beaten up again!""

""Why this time?"" asked his mother.

""Well,"" said Michel, ""when I arrived in the village a wedding coach came my way, so I sat down and cried and wrung my hands. Then the members of the wedding party came and gave me a beating.""

""You did a bad thing,"" responded the mother. ""You should have danced and shouted, 'Happiness and joy! Happiness and joy!'""

""I can still do that,"" replied Michel.

When he arrived in the village this time, there was a house on fire. He ran up to it, dancing and shouting, ""Happiness and joy! Happiness and joy!"" Then the men came and gave him a beating.

Michel returned home again and said to his mother, ""I got beaten up again!""

""Why this time?"" asked his mother.

Michel said, ""When I arrived in the village, there was a house on fire. I ran up to it dancing and shouting, 'Happiness and joy! Happiness and joy!' Then the men came and gave me a beating.""

""You did a bad thing,"" responded the mother. ""You should have thrown a bucket of water on it.""

""I can still do that,"" replied Michel.

When he arrived in the village this time, there was a wagon standing there filled with beehives, so he took a bucket of water and poured in on the bees. Then the beekeeper came and gave him a beating.

Michel returned home again and said to his mother, ""I got beaten up again!""

""Oh, why this time?"" asked his mother.

Michel answered, ""When I arrived in the village, there was a wagon standing there filled with beehives, so I took a bucket of water and poured in on the bees. Then the beekeeper came and gave me a beating.

""You did a bad thing,"" responded the mother. ""You should have said, 'Give me a sweet treat for my mother! Give me a sweet treat for my mother!'""

""I can still do that,"" replied Michel.

When he arrived in the village this time, a manure wagon was just being unloaded. Michel went up to it and said, ""Give me a sweet treat for my mother! Give me a sweet treat for my mother!""

""Gladly!"" said the workers. ""Just hold out your cap."" Then they filled his cap full to the top.

Then Michel went home and shouted, ""Mother, mother, see what I've got here! Mother, mother, see what I've got here!""

The episode of casting eyes is classified as a type 1006 folktale. ","Peter Christen Asbj�rnsen, Tales from the Fjeld: A Second Series of Popular Tales, translated by George Webbe Dasent (London: Chapman and Hall, 1874), pp. 335-52. ","Once on a time there was a goody who had a son called Matthew, but he was so stupid that he had no sense for anything, nor would he do much either; and the little he did was always topsy-turvy and never right, and so they never called him anything but ""Silly Matt.""

All this the goody thought bad; and it was still worse she thought that her son idled about and never turned his hand to anything else than yawning and stretching himself between the four walls.

Now close to where they lived ran a great river, and the stream was strong and bad to cross. So, one day, the goody said to the lad, there was no lack of timber there, for it grew almost up to the cottage-wall; he must cut some down and drag it to the bank and try to build a bridge over the river and take toll, and then he would both have something to do and something to live upon besides.

Yes! Matt thought so too, for his mother had said it; what she begged him do, he would do. That was safe and sure he said, for what she said must be so and not otherwise. So he hewed down timber and dragged it down and built a bridge. It didn't go so awfully fast with the work, but at any rate he had his hands full while it went on.

When the bridge was ready, the lad was to stand down at its end and take toll of those who wanted to cross, and his mother bade him be sure not to let any one over unless they paid the toll. It was all the same, she said, if it were not always in money. Goods and wares were just as good pay.

So the first day came three chaps with each his load of hay, and wanted to cross the bridge.

""No! no!"" said the lad; ""you can't go over till I've taken the toll.""

""We've nothing to pay it with,"" they said.

""Well, then! you can't cross; but it's all the same, if it isn't money. Goods will do just as well.""

So they gave him each a wisp of hay, and he had as much as would go on a little hand-sledge, and then they had leave to pass over the bridge.

Next came a pedlar with his pack, who sold needles and thread, and such like small wares, and he wanted to cross.

""You can't cross, till you have paid the toll,"" said the lad.

""I've nothing to pay it with,"" said the pedlar.

""You have wares, at any rate.""

""So the pedlar took out two needles and gave them him, and then he had leave to cross the bridge. As for the needles, the lad stuck them into the hay, and soon set off home.

So when he got home, he said, ""Now, I have taken the toll, and got something to live on.""

""What did you get?"" asked the goody.

""Oh!"" said he, ""there came three chaps, each with his load of hay. They each gave me a wisp of hay, so that I got a little sledge-load; and next, I got two needles from a pedlar.

""What did you do with the hay?"" asked the goody.

""I tried it between my teeth; but it tasted only of grass, so I threw into the river.""

""You ought to have spread it out on the byre-floor,"" said the goody.

""Well! I'll do that next time, mother,"" he said.

""And what then did you do with the needles?"" said the goody.

""I stuck them in the hay!""

""Ah!"" said his mother. ""You are a born fool. You should have stuck them in and out of your cap.""

""Well! don't say another word, mother, and I'll be sure to do so next time.""

Next day, when the lad stood down at the foot of the bridge again, there came a man from the mill with a sack of meal, and wanted to cross.

""You can't cross till you pay the toll,"" said the lad.

""I've no pence to pay it with,"" said the man.

""Well! You can't cross,"" said the lad; ""but goods are good pay.""

So he got a pound of meal, and the man had leave to cross. Not long after came a smith, with a horse-pack of smith's work, and wanted to cross; but it was still the same.

""You mustn't cross till you've paid the toll,"" said the lad.

But he too had no money either; so he gave the lad a gimlet, and then he had leave to cross. So when the lad got home to his mother, the toll was the first thing she asked about.

""What did you take for toll today?""

""Oh! there came a man from the mill with a sack of meal, and he gave me a pound of meal; and then came a smith, with a horse-load of smith's-work, and he gave me a gimlet.""

""And pray what did you do with the gimlet?"" asked the goody.

""I did as you bade me, mother,"" said the lad. ""I stuck it in and out of my cap.""

""Oh! but that was silly,"" said the goody; ""you oughtn't to have stuck it out and in your cap; but you should have stuck it up your shirt-sleeve.""

""Ay! ay! only be still, mother; and I'll be sure to do it next time.""

""And what did you do with the meal, I'd like to know?"" said the goody.

""Oh! I did as you bade me, mother. I spread it over the byre-floor.""

""Never heard anything so silly in my born days,"" said the goody; ""why, you ought to have gone home for a pail and put it into it.""

""Well! well! only be still, mother,"" said the lad; ""and I'll be sure to do it next time.""

Next day the lad was down at the foot of the bridge to take toll, and so there came a man with a horse-load of brandy, and wanted to cross.

""You can't cross till you pay the toll,"" said the lad.

""I've got no money,"" said the man.

""Well, then, you can't cross; but you have goods, of course,"" said the lad.

Yes; so he got half a quart of brandy, and that he poured up his shirt-sleeve. A while after came a man with a drove of goats, and wanted to cross the bridge.

""You can't cross till you pay the toll,"" said the lad.

Well! he was no richer than the rest. He had no money; but still he gave the lad a little billy-goat, and he got over with his drove. But the lad took the goat and trod it down into a bucket he had brought with him.

So when he got home, the goody asked again, ""What did you take today?""

""Oh! there came a man with a load of brandy, and from him I got a pint of brandy.""

""And what did you do with it!""

""I did as you bade me, mother; I poured it up my shirt-sleeve.""

""Ay! but that was silly, my son; you should have come home to fetch a bottle and poured it into it.""

""Well! well! be still this time, mother, and I'll be sure to do what you say next time,"" and then he went on.

""Next came a man with a drove of goats, and he gave me a little billy-goat, and that I trod down into the bucket.""

""Dear me!"" said his mother, ""that was silly, and sillier than silly, my son; you should have twisted a withy round its neck, and led the billy-goat home by it.""

""Well! be still, mother, and see if I don't do as you say next time.""

Next day he set oft for the bridge again to take toll, and so a man came with a load of butter, and wanted to cross. But the lad said he couldn't cross unless he paid toll.

""I've nothing to pay it with,"" said the man.

""Well! then you can't cross,"" said the lad; ""but you have goods, and I'll take them instead of money.""

So the man gave him a pat of butter, and then he had eave to cross the bridge, and the lad strode off to a grove of willows and twisted a withy, and twined it round the butter, and dragged it home along the road; but so long as he went he left some of the butter behind him, and when he got home there was none left.

""And what did you take today?"" asked his mother.

""There came a man with a load of butter, and he gave a pat.""

""Butter!"" said the goody, ""Where is it?""

""I did as you bade me, mother,"" said the lad. ""I tied a withy round the pat and led it home; but it was all lost by the way.""

""Oh!"" said the goody, ""You were born a fool, and you'll die a fool. Now you are not one bit better off for all your toil; but had you been like other folk, you might have had both meat and brandy, and both hay and tools. If you don't know better how to behave, I don't know what's to be done with you. Maybe, you might be more like the rest of the world, and get some sense into you if you were married to some one who could settle things for you, and so I think you had better set off and see about finding a brave lass; but you must be sure you know how to behave well on the way and to greet folk prettily when you meet them.""

""And pray what shall I say to them?"" asked the lad.

""To think of your asking that,"" said his mother. ""Why, of course, you must bid them 'God's Peace,' Don't you know that?""

""Yes! yes! I'll do as you bid,"" said the lad; and so he set off on his way to woo him a wife.

So, when he had gone a bit of the way, he met Greylegs, the wolf, with her seven cubs; and when he got so far as to be alongside them, he stood still and greeted them with ""God's Peace!"" and when he had said that, he went home again.

""I said it all as you bade me, mother,"" said Matt.

""And what was that?"" asked his mother.

""God's Peace,"" said Matt.

""And pray whom did you meet?""

""A she wolf with seven cubs; that was all I met,"" said Matt.

""Ay! ay! You are like yourself,"" said his mother. ""So it was, and so it will ever be. Why in the world did you say 'God's Peace' to a wolf. You should have clapped your hands and said, 'Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!' That's what you ought to have said.""

""Well! well! be still, mother,"" he said. I'll be sure to say so another time.""

And with that he strode off from the farm, and when he had gone a bit on the way, he met a bridal train.

So he stood still when he had got well up to the bride and bridegroom, and clapped his hands and said, ""Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!""

After that he went home to his mother and said, ""I did as you bade me mother; but I got a good thrashing for it, that I did.""

""What was it you did?"" she asked.

""Oh! I clapped my hands and called out, 'Huf! huf! you jade of a she-wolf!'""

""And what was it you met?""

""I met a bridal train.""

""Ah! you are a fool, and always will be a fool,"" said his mother. ""Why should you say such things to a bridal train. You should have said, 'Ride happily, bride and bridegroom.'""

""Well! well! See if I don't say so next time,"" said the lad, and off he went again.

So he met a bear, who was taking a ride on a horse, and Matt waited till he came alongside him, and then he said, ""A happy ride to you, bride and bridegroom,"" and then he went back to his mother and told her how he had said what she bade him.

""And pray! what was it you said?"" she asked.

""I said, 'A happy ride to you both, bride and bridegroom.'""

""And whom did you meet?""

""I met a bear taking a ride on a horse,"" said Matt.

""My goodness! what a fool you are,"" said his mother. ""You ought to have said, 'To the de'il with you.' That's what you ought to have said.""

""Well! well! mother, I'll be sure to say so next time.""

So he set off again, and this time he met a funeral; and when he had come well up to the coffin, he greeted it and said, ""To the de'il with you!"" and then he ran home to his mother, and told her he had said what she bade him.

""And what was that?"" she asked.

""Oh! I said, 'To the de'il with you.'""

""And what was it you met?""

""I met a funeral,"" said Matt; ""but I got more kicks than halfpence!""

""You didn't get half enough,"" said the goody. ""Why, of course, you ought to have said, 'May your poor soul have mercy.' That's what you ought to have said.""

""Ay! ay! mother! so I will next time, only be still,"" said Matt, and off he went again.

So when he had gone a bit of the way he fell on two ugly Gypsies who were skinning a dog. So when he came up to them he greeted them and said, ""May your poor soul have mercy,"" and when he had said so he went home and told his mother he had said what she bade him; but all he got was such a drubbing he could scarce drag one leg after the other.

""But what was it you said?"" asked the goody.

""'May your poor soul have mercy,' that was what I said.""

""And whom did you meet?""

""A pair of Gypsies skinning a dog,"" he said.

""Well! well!"" said the goody. ""There's no hope of your changing. You'll always be a shame and sorrow to us wherever you go. I never heard such shocking words. But now, you must set out and take no notice of any one you meet, for you must be off to woo a wife, and see if you can get some one who knows more of the ways of the world and has a better head on her shoulders than yours. And now you must behave like other folk, and if all goes well you may bless your stars, and bawl out, ""Hurrah!""

Yes, the lad did all that his mother bade him. He set off and wooed a lass, and she thought he couldn't be so bad a fellow after all; and so she said, ""Yes,"" she would have him.

When the lad got home the goody wanted to know what his sweetheart's name was; but he did not know. So the goody got angry and said, he must just set off again, for she would know what the girl's name was. So when Matt was going home again he had sense enough to ask her what she was called.

""Well,"" she said, ""my name is Solvy; but I thought you knew it already.""

So Matt ran off home, and as he went he mumbled to himself,

    Solvy, Solvy,
    Is my darling!
    Solvy, Solvy,
    Is my darling?

But just as he was running as hard as he could to reach home before he forgot it, he tripped over a tuft of grass, and forgot the name again. So when he got on his feet again he began to search all round the hillock, but all he could find was a spade. So he seized it and began to dig and search as hard as he could, and as he was hard at it up came an old man.

""What are you digging for?"" said the man. ""Have you lost anything here?""

""Oh yes! oh yes! I have lost my sweetheart's name, and I can't find it again.""

""I think her name is Solvy,"" said the man.

""Oh yes, that's it,"" said Matt, and away he ran with the spade in his hand, bawling out,

    Solvy, Solvy,
    Is my darling!

But when he had gone a little way he called to mind that he had taken the spade, and so he threw it behind him, right onto the man's leg. Then the man began to roar and bemoan himself as though he had a knife stuck in him, and then Matt forgot the name again, and ran home as fast as he could, and when he got there, the first thing his mother asked was, ""What's your sweetheart's name?""

But Matt was just as wise as when he set out, for he did not know the name any better the last than the first time.

""You are the same big fool, that you are,"" said the goody. ""You won't do any better this time either. But now I'll just set off myself and fetch the girl home, and get you married. Meanwhile you must fetch water up to the fifth plank all round the room, and wash it, and then you must take a little fat and a little lean, and the greenest thing you can find in the cabbage garden, and boil them all up together; and when you have done that you must put yourself into fine feather, and look smart when your lassie comes, and then you may sit down on the dresser.""

Yes, all that Matt thought he could do very well. He fetched water and dashed it about the room in floods, but he couldn't get it to stand above the fourth plank, for when it rose higher it ran out. So he had to leave off that work. But now you must know, they had a dog whose name was Fat, and a cat whose name was Lean. Both these he took and put into the soup-kettle. As for the greenest thing in the garden, it was a green gown which the goody had meant for her daughter-in-law; that he cut up into little bits, and away it went into the pot; but their little pig, which was called All, he cooked by himself in the brewing tub. And when Matt had done all this he laid hands on a pot of treacle and a feather pillow. Then he first of all rubbed himself all over with the treacle, and then he tore open the pillow and rolled himself in the feathers, and then he sat down on the dresser out in the kitchen, till his mother and the lassie came.

Now the first thing the goody missed when she came to her house was the dog, for it always used to meet her out of doors. The next thing was the cat, for it always met her in the porch, and when the weather was right down good and the sun shone, she even came out into the yard, and met her at the garden gate. Nor could she see the green gown she had meant for her daughter-in-law either, and her piggy-wiggy, which followed her grunting wherever she went, he was not there either. So she went in to see about all this; but as soon as ever she lifted the latch, out poured the water through the doorway like a waterfall, so that they were almost borne away by the flood, both the goody and the lassie.

So they had to go round by the back door, and when they got inside the kitchen there sat that figure of fun all befeathered.

""What have you done?"" said the goody.

""I did just as you bade me, mother,"" said Matt. ""I tried to get the water up to the fifth plank, but as fast as ever I poured it in it ran out again, and so I could only get up as high as the fourth plank.""

""Well! well! but Fat and Lean,"" said the goody, who wished to turn it off; ""what have you done with them?""

""I did as you bade me, mother,"" said Matt. ""I took and put them into the soup-kettle. They both scratched and bit, and they mewed and whined, and Fat was strong and kicked against it; but he had to go in at last all the same; and as for All, he's cooking by himself in the brewing tub in the brew-house, for there wasn't room for him in the soup-kettle.""

""But what have you done with that new green gown I meant for my daughter-in-law?"" said the goody, trying to hide his silliness.

""Oh! I did as you bade me, mother. It hung out in the cabbage-garden, and as it was the greatest thing there, I took it and cut it up small, and yonder it boils in the soup.""

""Away ran the goody to the chimney-corner, tore off the pot and turned it upside down with all that was in it. Then she filled it anew and put it on to boil. But when she had time to look at Matt she was quite shocked.

""Why is it you are such a figure?"" she cried.

""I did as you bade me, mother,"" said Matt. ""First I rubbed myself all over with treacle to make myself sweet for my bride, and then I tore open the pillow and put myself into fine feathers.""

Well, the goody turned it off as well as she could, and picked off the feathers from her son, and washed him clean, and put fresh clothes on him.

So at last they were to have the wedding, but first Matt was to go to the town and sell a cow to buy things for the bridal. The goody had told him what he was to do, and the beginning and end of what she said was, he was to be sure to get something for the cow. So when he got to the market with the cow, and they asked what he was to have for her, they could get no other answer out of him than that he was to have something for her. So at last came a butcher, who begged him to take the cow and follow him home, and he'd be sure to give him something for her.

Yes, Matt went off with the cow, and when he got to the butcher's house the butcher spat into the palm of Matt's hand, and said, ""There, you have something for your cow, but look sharp after it.""

So off went Matt as carefully as if he trode on eggs, holding his hand shut; but when he had got about as far as the cross-road, which led to their farm, he met the parson, who came driving along.

""Open the gate for me, my lad,"" said the parson.

So the lad hastened to open the gate, but in doing so he forgot what he had in his palm, and took the gate by both hands, so that what he got for the cow was left sticking on the gate. So when he saw it was gone he got cross, and said, his reverence had taken something from him.

But when the parson asked him if he had lost his wits, and said he had taken nothing from him, Matt got so wrath he killed the parson at a blow, and buried him in a bog by the wayside.

So when he got home he told his mother all about it, and she slaughtered a billy-goat, and laid it where Matt had laid the parson, but she buried the parson in another place. And when she had done that she hung over the fire a pot of brose, and when it was cooked she made Matt sit down in the ingle and split matches. Meantime she went up on the roof with the pot and poured the brose down the chimney, so that it streamed over her son.

Next day came the sheriff. So when the sheriff asked him, Matt did not gainsay that he had slain the parson, and more, he was quite ready to show the sheriff where he had laid his reverence.

But when the sheriff asked on what day it happened, Matt said, ""It was the day when it rained brose over the whole world.""

So when he got to the spot where he had buried the parson the sheriff pulled out the billy-goat, and asked, ""Had your parson horns?""

Now when the judges heard the story, they made up their minds that the lad was quite out of his wits, and so he got off scot free.

So after all the bridal was to stand, and the goody had a long talk with her son, and bade him be sure to behave prettily when they sat at table. He was not to look too much at the bride, but to cast an eye at her now and then. Peas he might eat by himself, but he must share the eggs with her, and he was not to lay the leg bones by his side on the table, but to place them tidily on his plate.

Yes, Matt would do all that, and he did it well; yes, he did all that his mother bade him, and nothing else. First, he stole out to the sheepfold, and plucked the eyes out of all the sheep and goats he could find, and took them with him. So when they went to dinner he sat with his back to his bride; but all at once he cast a sheep's eye at her so that it hit her full in her face; and a little while after he cast another, and so he went on. As for the eggs he ate them all up to his own cheek, so that the lassie did not get a taste, but when the peas came he shared them with her. And when they had eaten a while Matt put his feet together, and up on his plate went his legs.

At night, when they were to go to bed, the lassie was tired and weary, for she thought it no good to have such a fool for her husband. So she said she had forgotten something and must go out a little; but she could not get Matt's leave; he would follow her, for to tell the truth, he was afraid she would never come back.

""No! no! lie still, I say,"" said the bride. ""See, here's a long hair-rope; tie it round me, and I'll leave the door ajar. So if you think I'm too long away you have only to pull the rope and then you'll drag me in again.""

Yes, Matt was content with that; but as soon as the lassie got out into the yard she caught a billy-goat and untied the rope and tied it round him.

So when Matt thought she was too long out of doors he began to haul in the rope, and so he dragged the billy-goat up into bed to him. But when he had lain a while, he bawled out, ""Mother! mother! my bride has horns like a billygoat!""

""Stuff! silly boy to lie and bewail yourself."" said his mother. ""It's only her hair-plaits, poor thing, I'm sure.""

In a little while Matt called out again, ""Mother! mother! my bride has a beard like a goat.""

""Stuff! silly boy to lie there and rave,"" said the goody.

But there was no rest in that house that night, for in a little while Matt screeched out that his bride was like a billy-goat all over.

So when it grew towards morning the goody said, ""Jump up, my son, and make a fire.""

So Matt climbed up to a shelf under the roof, and set fire to some straw and chips, and other rubbish that lay there. But then such a smoke rose, that he couldn't bear it any longer indoors. He was forced to go out, and just then the day broke. As for the goody, she too had to make a start of it, and when they got out the house was on fire, so that the flames came right out at the roof.

""Good luck! good luck! Hip, hip, hurrah!"" roared out Matt, for he thought it fine fun to have such an ending to his bridal feast. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","George Stephens, ""Two English Folk-Tales,"" The Folk-Lore Record, vol. 3, part 2 (London: Printed for the Folk-Lore Society by Messrs. Nichols and Sons, 1881), pp. 153-55. ","There was once a little boy, and his mother sent him to buy a sheep's head and pluck; afraid he should forget it, the lad kept saying all the way along:

    Sheep's head and pluck!
    Sheep's head and pluck! 

Trudging along, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and hurt himself, and, beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for. So he stood a little while to consider; at last he thought he recollected it, and began to repeat:

    Liver and lights [lungs] and gall and all!
    Liver and lights and gall and all! 

Away he went again, and came to where a man was sick, bawling out:

    Liver and lights and gall and all!
    Liver and lights and gall and all! 

Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:

    Pray God send no more up!
    Pray God send no more up! 

The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a field where a hind [farm servant] was sowing wheat:

    Pray God send no more up!
    Pray God send no more up! 

This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged him to repeat:

    Pray God send plenty more!
    Pray God send plenty more! 

Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his:

    Pray God send plenty more!
    Pray God send plenty more! 

The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat:

    Pray God send the soul to heaven!
    Pray God send the soul to heaven! 

Away went the boy, and met a dog and a bitch going to be hung, but his cry rang out:

    Pray God send the soul to heaven!
    Pray God send the soul to heaven! 

The good folk nearly were furious, seized and struck him, charging him to say:

    A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!
    A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung! 

This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going to be married. ""Oh! oh!"" he shouted:

    A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!
    A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung! 

The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump, and ordered him to repeat:

    I wish you much joy!
    I wish you much joy! 

This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:

    I wish you much joy!
    I wish you much joy! 

This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength, scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say:

    The one is out, I wish the other was!
    The one is out, I wish the other was! 

On went young 'un till he found a fellow with only one eye; but he kept up his song:

    The one is out, I wish the other was!
    The one is out, I wish the other was! 

This was too much for Master One-eye, who grabbed him and chastised him, bidding him call:

    The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!
    The one side gives good light, I wish the other did! 

So he did, to be sure, till he came to a house, one side of which was on fire. The people here thought it was he who had set the place a-blazing, and straightway put him in prison. The end was, the judge put on his black cap and condemned him to die. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","Joseph Jacobs, English Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1890), no. 27, pp.152-54. ","Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman got her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of the hearth in the wintertime. So they called him Lazy Jack.

His mother could not get him to do anything for her, and at last told him, one Monday, that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she would turn him out to get his living as he could.

This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day to a neighboring farmer for a penny. But as he was coming home, never having had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook.

""You stupid boy,"" said his mother, ""you should have put it in your pocket.""

""I'll do so another time,"" replied Jack.

On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper, who gave him a jar of milk for his day's work. Jack took the jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got home.

""Dear me!"" said the old woman. ""You should have carried it on your head.""

""I'll do so another time,"" said Jack.

So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer who agreed to give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took the cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the cheese was all spoiled, part of it being lost, and part matted with his hair.

""You stupid lout,"" said his mother, ""you should have carried it very carefully in your hands.""

""I'll do another time,"" replied Jack.

On Friday Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who would give him nothing for his work but a large tomcat. Jack took the cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short time pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go.

When he got home, his mother said to him, ""You silly fellow, you should have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.""

""I'll do so another time,"" said Jack.

So on Saturday Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton, tied it to a string and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoiled.

His mother was this time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was Sunday, and she was obliged to do with cabbage for her dinner. ""You ninny-hammer,"" said she to her son, ""you should have carried it on your shoulder.""

""I'll do so another time,"" replied Jack.

On the next Monday Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a cattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Jack found it hard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and began walking slowly home with his prize.

Now it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, but deaf and dumb. Now she had never laughed in her life, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made her laugh. This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered her speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his promise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich gentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack's mother lived with them in great happiness until she died.",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

""Weel,"" says Jock, ""I'll do that.""

So awa' he gangs, and fa's in wi' a packman. Says the packman: ""If ye carry my pack a' day, I'll gie ye a needle at night.""

So he carried the pack, and got the needle; and as he was gaun awa' hame to his mither, he cuts a burden o' brakens, and put the needle into the heart o' them. Awa' he gaes hame.

Says his mither: ""What hae ye made o' yersel' the day?""

Says Jock: ""I fell in wi' a packman, and carried his pack a' day, and he ga'e me a needle for't; and ye may look for it amang the brakens.""

""Hout,"" quo' she, ""ye daft gowk, ye should hae stuck it into your bonnet, man.""

""I'll mind that again,"" quo' Jock.

Next day he fell in wi' a man carrying plough socks. ""If ye help me to carry my socks a' day, I'll gie ye ane to yersel' at night.""

""I'll do that,"" quo' Jock.

Jock carries them a' day, and gets a sock, which he sticks in his bonnet. On the way hame, Jock was dry, and gaed awa' to tak a drink out o' the burn; and wi' the weight o' the sock, it fell into the river, and gaed out o' sight.

He gaed hame, and his mother says: ""Weel, Jock, what hae ye been doing a' day?""

And then he tells her.

""Hout,"" quo' she, ""ye should hae tied a string to it, and trailed it behind you.""

""Weel,"" quo' Jock, ""I'll mind that again.

Awa' he sets, and he fa's in wi' a flesher. ""Weel,"" says the flesher, ""if ye'll be my servant a' day, I'll gie ye a leg o' mutton at night.""

""I'll be that,"" quo' Jock.

He gets a leg o' mutton at night; he ties a string to it, and trails it behind him the hale road hame.

""What hae ye been doing?"" said his mither.

He tells her.

""Hout, ye fool, ye should hae carried it on your shouther.""

""I'll mind that again,"" quo' Jock.

Awa' he goes next day, and meets a horse-dealer. He says: ""If ye will help me wi' my horses a' day, I'll gie ye ane to yersel' at night.""

""I'll do that,"" quo' Jock. So he served him, and got his horse, and he ties its feet; but as he was not able to carry it on his back, he left it lying on the roadside.

Hame he comes, and tells his mother.

""Hout, ye daft gowk, ye'll ne'er turn wise! Could ye no hae loupen on it, and ridden it?""

""I'll mind that again,"" quo' Jock.

Aweel, there was a grand gentleman, wha had a daughter wha was very subject to melancholy; and her father gave out that whaever should make her laugh would get her in marriage. So it happened that she was sitting at the window ae day, musing in her melancholy state, when Jock, according to the advice o' his mither, came flying up on the cow's back, wi' the tail owre his shouther. And she burst out into a fit o' laughter. When they made inquiry wha made her laugh, it was found to be Jock riding on the cow. Accordingly, Jock is sent for to get his bride.

Weel, Jock is married to her, and there was a great supper prepared. Amongst the rest o' the things there was some honey, which Jock was very fond o'. After supper, they were bedded, and the auld priest that married them sat up a' night by the fireside.

So Jock waukens in the night-time, and says: ""O wad ye gie me some o' yon nice sweet honey that we got to our supper last night?""

""O ay,"" says his wife; ""rise and gang into the press, and ye'll get a pig fou o't.""

Jock rises, and thrusts his hand into the honey-pig for a nievefu' o't; and he could not get it out. So he came awa' wi' the pig on his hand, like a mason's mell, and says: ""Oh, I canna get my hand out.""

""Hout,"" quo' she, ""gang awa' and break it on the cheek-stane.""

By this time the fire was dark, and the auld priest was lying snoring wi' his head against the chimney-piece, wi' a huge white wig on. Jock gaes awa', and ga'e him a whack wi' the honey-pig on the head, thinking it was the cheek-stane, and knocks it a' in bits.

The auld priest roars out ""Murder!""

Jock taks down the stair as hard as he can bicker, and hides himsel' amang the bees' skeps.

That night, as luck wad have it, some thieves came to steal the bees' skeps, and in the hurry o' tumbling them into a large gray plaid, they tumbled Jock in alang wi' them. So aff they set, wi' Jock and the skeps on their backs. On the way, they had to cross the burn where Jock lost his bannet.

Ane o' the thieves cries: ""O I hae fand a bannet!"" and Jock, on hearing that, cries out: ""O that's mine!""

They thocht they had got the deil on their backs. So they let a' fa' in the burn; and Jock, being tied in the plaid, couldna get out; so he and the bees were a' drowned thegither.

1696,I'll Be Wiser the Next Time,Ireland,,"Patrick Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (London: Macmillan and Company, 1866), pp. 39-42. ","Jack was twenty years old before he done any good for his family. So at last his mother said it was high time for him to begin to be of some use. So the next market day she sent him to Bunclody (Newtownbarry), to buy a billhook to cut the furze. When he was coming back he kep' cutting gaaches with it round his head, till at last it flew out of his hand, and killed a lamb that a neighbour was bringing home. Well, if he did, so sure was his mother obliged to pay for it, and Jack was in disgrace.

""Musha, you fool,"" says she, ""couldn't you lay the billhook in a car, or stick it into a bundle of hay or straw that any of the neighbours would be bringing home?""

""Well, mother,"" said he, ""it can't be helped now; I'll be wiser next time.""

""Now, Jack,"" says she, the next Saturday, ""you behaved like a fool the last time; have some wit about you now, and don't get us into a hobble. Here is a fi'penny bit, and buy me a good pair (set) of knitting needles, and fetch 'em home safe.""

""Never fear, mother.""

When Jack was outside the town, coming back, he overtook a neighbour sitting on the side-lace of his car, and there was a big bundle of hay in the bottom of it.

""Just the safe thing,"" says Jack, sticking the needles into it. When he came home he looked quite proud out of his good management.

""Well, Jack,"" says his mother, ""where's the needles?""

""Oh, faith ! they're safe enough. Send any one down to Jem Doyle's, and he'll find them in the bundle of hay that's in the car.""

""Musha, purshuin to you, Jack! why couldn't you stick them in the band o' your hat? What searching there will be for them in the hay!""

""Sure you said I ought to put any things I was bringing home in a car, or stick 'em in hay or straw. Anyhow I'll be wiser next time.""

Next week Jack was sent to a neighbour's house about a mile away, for some of her nice fresh butter. The day was hot, and Jack remembering his mother's words, stuck the cabbage leaf that held the butter between his hat and the band. He was luckier this turn than the other turns, for he brought his errand safe in his hair and down along his clothes. There's no pleasing some people, however, and his mother was so vexed that she was ready to beat him.

There was so little respect for Jack's gumption in the whole village after this, that he wasn't let go to market for a fortnight. Then his mother trusted him with a pair of young fowl. ""Now don't be too eager to snap at the first offer you'll get; wait for the second any way, and above all things keep your wits about you.""

Jack got to the market safe.

""How do you sell them fowl, honest boy?""

My mother bid me ax three shillings for 'em, but sure herself said I wouldn't get it.""

""She never said a truer word. Will you have eighteen pence?""

""In throth an' I won't; she ordhered me to wait for a second offer.""

""And very wisely she acted; here is a shilling.""

""Well now, I think it would be wiser to take the eighteen pence, but it is better for me at any rate to go by her bidding, and then she can't blame me.""

Jack was in disgrace for three weeks after making that bargain; and some of the neighbours went so far as to say that Jack's mother didn't show much more wit than Jack himself.""

She had to send him, however, next market day to sell a young sheep, and says she to him, ""Jack, I'll have your life if you don't get the highest penny in the market for that baste.""

""Oh, won't I!"" says Jack.

Well, when he was standing in the market, up comes a jobber, and asks him what he'd take for the sheep.

""My mother won't be satisfied,"" says Jack, ""if I don't bring her home the highest penny in the market.""

""Will a guinea note do you?"" says the other.

""Is it the highest penny in the market?"" says Jack.

""No, but here's the highest penny in the market,"" says a sleeveen that was listenin', getting up on a high ladder that was restin' again' the market house. ""Here's the highest penny, and the sheep is mine.""

Well, if the poor mother wasn't heart-scalded this time it's no matter. She said she'd never lose more than a shilling a turn by him again while she lived; but she had to send him for some groceries next Saturday for all that, for it was Christmas eve.

""Now, Jack,"" says she, ""I want some cinnamon, mace, and cloves, and half a pound of raisins; will you be able to think of 'em?""

""Able, indeed! I'll be repatin' 'em every inch o' the way, and that won't let me forget them.""

So he never stopped as he ran along, saying ""cinnamon, mace, and cloves, and half a pound of raisins;"" and this time he'd have come home in glory, only he struck his foot again' a stone, and fell down, and hurt himself.

At last he got up, and as he went limping on he strove to remember his errand, but it was changed in his mind to ""pitch, and tar, and turpentine, and half a yard of sacking. Pitch, and tar, and turpentine, and half a yard of sacking.""

These did not help the Christmas dinner much, and his mother was so tired of minding him that she sent him along with a clever black man (matchmaker), up to the county Carlow, to get a wife to take care of him.

Well, the black man never let him open his mouth all the time the coortin' was goin' on; and at last the whole party -- his friends, and her friends, were gathered into the priest's parlour. The black man staid close to him for 'fraid he'd do a bull; and when Jack was married half a year, if he thought his life was bad enough before, he thought it ten times worse now; and told his mother if she'd send his wife back to her father, he'd never make a mistake again going to fair or market. But the wife cock-crowed over the mother as well as over Jack; and if they didn't live happy, THAT WE MAY! ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
1696,The Fool's Good Fortune,Georgia,The episode of the robbers under the tree is categorized as Aarne-Thompson type 1653. ,"Marjory Wardrop, Georgian Folk Tales (London: David Nutt, 1894), pp. 165-167. ","A certain man died and left three sons. One was altogether a fool, another was fairly intelligent, and the third was rather clever. This being so, it was of course difficult for them to live together. In dividing the inheritance among them, the fool was cheated, and in regard to the cattle he was thus duped: There were three entrances to the pen, two open and one very narrow. The two clever brothers proposed to drive the beasts out of all three at once; those that issued from the small gap were to belong to the fool. In this way the latter's share was only one young bull out of the whole flock. But to his feeble mind the division seemed fair enough, so he contentedly drove his bull out into the forest, and tied it with a stout rope to a young tree, whilst he himself wandered aimlessly about.

Three days later, the fool went to see his beast. It had eaten and drunk nothing, but had pulled the tree up by the roots, and laid bare a jar full of old gold coins. The fool was delighted, and played with the money for a time. Then he resolved to take the jar and present it to the king. As he passed along the road, every wayfarer looked into the pot, took out the gold in handfuls, and so that he should not notice their thefts, filled it up with stones and blocks of wood. On reaching the palace, the fool asked for an audience of the king, and it was granted. He emptied out the contents of the jar at the feet of the king. When the courtiers saw the wrath of the king, they took the fool away and beat him. When he had recovered himself he asked why he had been thrashed. One of the bystanders, for fun, cried to him, ""You have been beaten because you labor in vain.""

The fool went his way, muttering the words, ""You labor in vain."" As he passed a peasant who was reaping, he repeated his phrase again and again, until the peasant grew angry, and thrashed him. The fool asked why he had been beaten, and what he ought to have said.

""You ought to have said, 'God give you a good harvest!'""

The fool went on, saying ""God give you a good harvest!"" and met a funeral. Again he was beaten, and again he asked what he should say.

They replied that he should have said, ""Heaven rest your soul!"" He then came to a wedding, and saluted the newly married couple with this funereal phrase.

Again he was beaten, and then told that he should say, ""Be fruitful and multiply!""

His next visit was to a monastery, and he accosted every monk with his new salutation. They too gave him a thrashing, with such vigor that the fool determined to have his revenge by stealing of the bells from their belfry. So he hid himself until the monks had gone to rest, and then carried off a bell of moderate size.

He went into the forest, climbed a tree, and hung the bell on the branches, ringing it from time to time, partly to amuse himself and partly to frighten away wild beasts. In the forest there was a gang of robbers, who were assembled to share their booty, and had just ended a merry banquet. Suddenly they heard the sound of the bell, and were much afraid. They took counsel as to what was to be done, and most of them were for flight, but the oldest of the band advised them to send a scout to see what was wrong. The bravest among them was sent to get information, and the rest remained as quiet as possible.

The brigand went on tiptoe through the bushes to the tree where the fool was, and respectfully asked, ""Who are you? If you are an angel sent by God to punish our wickedness, pray spare us and we shall repent. If you are a devil from hell, come and share with us.""

The fool was not so stupid that he did not see he had to deal with robbers, so he took out a knife, tolled the bell, and then said with a grave air, ""If you wish to know who I am, climb the tree and show me your tongue, so that I may mark on it who I am and what I ask of you.""

The robber obediently climbed the tree, and put out his tongue as far as he could. The fool cut off his tongue, and kicked him to the ground. The robber, mad with pain, and frightened by his sudden fall, ran off howling. His comrades had come out to meet him, and when they saw the plight he was in, they ran off in terror, leaving their wealth. Next morning the fool found the booty, and without saying anything to anybody, took it home and became much richer than his brothers. The fool built three palaces: one for himself, one for me, and one for you. There is merrymaking in the fool's palace. Come and be one of the guests!",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
1696,A Stupid Boy,Kashmir,,"J. Hinton Knowles, Folk-Tales of Kashmir (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Company, 1893), pp. 189-90.","A poor widow's misery was increased by the knowledge that her son, her only son, around whom she had built up many many hopes, was a half-wit.

One day she sent him to the bazaar with some cloth and told him to sell it for four rupees. The boy went, and sat down in the most public thoroughfare of the city.

""How much do you want for that piece of cloth?"" asked a man.

""Four rupees,"" replied the boy.

""All right. I'll give you six rupees for it. It is worth it. Here, take the money.""

""No, no,"" said the boy. ""Its price is four rupees.""

""You scamp!"" exclaimed the man angrily, and went on. He thought the boy was joking with him.

On reaching home in the evening he informed his mother of this incident, and she was grieved that he had not taken the money.

Another day she sent him to the bazaar, and advised him to salaam everybody, saying that nothing was ever lost by politeness, but, on the contrary, everything was sometimes gained by it. The stupid boy sallied forth, and began making salaams to everybody and everything he met -- a sweeper, a horse, some little children, a house. A number of asses, too, passed by with loads on their backs, and he said ""Salaam"" to them also.

""Hey! You fool! What are you doing?"" said the donkey-driver in charge. ""Don't you know that we say ""Fri fri?"" [an exclamation used for urging on donkeys], whereupon the boy commenced saying ""Fri fri"" to every person and thing. He passed a man who had just spread a snare for a bird that he very much wished to catch, when ""Fri fri"" shouted the boy, and most effectually frightened away the bird.

""You blackguard! What are you doing?"" said the man. ""You should say ""Lag lag"" in a very soft tone.""

Then the boy began to say ""Lag lag."" He was wandering about crying ""Lag lag"" when he came across some thieves coming out of a garden, where they had just been stealing the fruit.

""What do you mean?"" said they. ""Be quiet, you fool, or say something else. Go and shout, 'Let go one and take the other.'""

So the boy did, and while he was shouting these words a funeral cortege passed by.

""Be quiet,"" said some of the mourners. ""Have you so little respect for the dead? Get along home.""

2,Why the Bear Is Stumpy-Tailed ,Norway,,"Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, Jørgen Engebretsen Moe, Popular Tales from the Norse (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1859), no. 20, p. 155. ","One day the bear met the fox, who came slinking along with a string of fish he had stolen.

""Whence did you get those from?"" asked the bear.

""Oh! my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them,"" said the fox.

So the bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the fox tell him how he was to set about it.

""Oh! it's an easy craft for you,"" answered the fox, and soon learnt. You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can. You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pull too.""

Yes; the bear did as the fox had said, and held his tail a long, long time down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with a cross pull, and it snapped short off. That's why Bruin goes about with a stumpy tail this very day. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
2,How the Wolf Lost His Tail,Scotland,"This is manifestly the same as the Norse story ""Why the Bear Is Stumpy-Tailed,"" and it errs in ascribing a stumpy tail to the wolf. There was not time for the ""Norse Tales"" to become known to the people who told the story, so perhaps this may be a Norse tradition transferred from the bear to the wolf. ","J. F. Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands: Orally Collected, vol. 1 (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1860), pp. 272-73.. ","One day the wolf and the fox were out together, and they stole a dish of crowdie. Now the wolf was the biggest beast of the two, and he had a long tail like a greyhound, and great teeth.

The fox was afraid of him, and did not dare to say a word when the wolf ate the most of the crowdie, and left only a little at the bottom of the dish for him, but he determined to punish him for it; so the next night when they were out together the fox said, ""I smell a very nice cheese, and (pointing to the moonshine on the ice) there it is too.""

""And how will you get it?"" said the wolf.

""Well, stop you here till I see if the farmer is asleep, and if you keep your tail on it, nobody will see you or know that it is there. Keep it steady. I may be some time coming back.""

So the wolf lay down and laid his tail on the moonshine in the ice, and kept it for an hour till it was fast.

Then the fox, who had been watching him, ran in to the farmer and said, ""The wolf is there; he will eat up the children -- the wolf! the wolf!""

Then the farmer and his wife came out with sticks to kill the wolf, but the wolf ran off leaving his tail behind him, and that's why the wolf is stumpy tailed to this day, though the fox has a long brush. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

    ""The Fox and His Members"" (type 154). ","Joseph Jacobs, Europa's Fairy Book [also published under the title European Folk and Fairy Tales], (New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1916), pp. 42-50. ","You must know that once upon a time Reynard the Fox and Bruin the Bear went into partnership and kept house together. Would you like to know the reason? Well, Reynard knew that Bruin had a beehive full of honeycomb, and that was what he wanted; but Bruin kept so close a guard upon his honey that Master Reynard didn't know how to get away from him and get hold of the honey.

So one day he said to Bruin, ""Pardner, I have to go and be gossip -- that means godfather, you know -- to one of my old friends.""

""Why, certainly,"" said Bruin.

So off Reynard goes into the woods, and after a time he crept back and uncovered the beehive and had such a feast of honey. Then he went back to Bruin, who asked him what name had been given to the child. Reynard had forgotten all about the christening and could only say, ""Just-begun.""

""What a funny name,"" said Master Bruin.

A little while after Reynard thought he would like another feast of honey. So he told Bruin that he had to go to another christening; and off he went. And when he came back and Bruin asked him what was the name given to the child Reynard said, ""Half-eaten.""

The third time the same thing occurred, and this time the name given by Reynard to the child that didn't exist was ""All-gone."" You can guess why.

A short time afterwards Master Bruin thought he would like to eat up some of his honey and asked Reynard to come and join him in the feast. When they got to the beehive Bruin was so surprised to find that there was no honey left; and he turned round to Reynard and said, ""Just-begun, Half- eaten, All-gone -- so that is what you meant; you have eaten my honey.""

""Why no,"" said Reynard, ""how could that be? I have never stirred from your side except when I went a-gossiping, and then I was far away from here. You must have eaten the honey yourself, perhaps when you were asleep; at any rate we can easily tell; let us lie down here in the sunshine, and if either of us has eaten the honey, the sun will soon sweat it out of us.""

No sooner said than done, and the two lay side by side in the sunshine. Soon Master Bruin commenced to doze, and Mr. Reynard took some honey from the hive and smeared it round Bruin's snout; then he woke him up and said, ""See, the honey is oozing out of your snout; you must have eaten it when you were asleep.""

Some time after this Reynard saw a man driving a cart full of fish, which made his mouth water. So he ran and he ran and he ran till he got far away in front of the cart and lay down in the road as still as if he were dead.

When the man came up to him and saw him lying there dead, as he thought, he said to himself, ""Why, that will make a beautiful red fox scarf and muff for my wife Ann.""

And he got down and seized hold of Reynard and threw him into the cart all along with the fish, and then he went driving on as before. Reynard began to throw the fish out till there were none left, and then he jumped out himself without the man noticing it, who drove up to his door and called out, ""Ann, Ann, see what I have brought you.""

And when his wife came to the door she looked into the cart and said, ""Why, there is nothing there.""

Reynard in the meantime had brought all his fish together and began eating some when up comes Bruin and asked for a share.

""No, no,"" said Reynard, ""we only share food when we have shared work. I fished for these, you go and fish for others.""

""Why, how could you fish for these? The water is all frozen over,"" said Bruin.

""I'll soon show you,"" said Reynard, and brought him down to the bank of the river, and pointed to a hole in the ice and said, ""I put my tail in that, and the fish were so hungry I couldn't draw them up quick enough. Why do you not do the same?""

So Bruin put his tail down and waited and waited but no fish came. ""Have patience, man,"" said Reynard; ""as soon as one fish comes the rest will follow.""

""Ah, I feel a bite,"" said Bruin, as the water commenced to freeze round his tail and caught it in the ice.

""Better wait till two or three have been caught and then you can catch three at a time. I'll go back and finish my lunch.""

And with that Master Reynard trotted up to the man's wife and said to her, ""Ma'am, there's a big black bear caught by the tail in the ice; you can do what you like with him.""

So the woman called her husband and they took big sticks and went down to the river and commenced whacking Bruin who, by this time, was fast in the ice. He pulled and he pulled and he pulled, till at last he got away leaving three quarters of his tail in the ice, and that is why bears have such short tails up to the present day.

Meanwhile Master Reynard was having a great time in the man's house, golloping everything he could find till the man and his wife came back and found him with his nose in the cream jug. As soon as he heard them come in he tried to get away, but not before the man had seized hold of the cream jug and thrown it at him, just catching him on the tail, and that is the reason why the tips of foxes' tails are cream white to this very day.

Well, Reynard crept home and found Bruin in such a state, who commenced to grumble and complain that it was all Reynard's fault that he had lost his tail.

So Reynard pointed to his own tail and said, ""Why, that's nothing; see my tail; they hit me so hard upon the head my brains fell out upon my tail. Oh, how bad I feel; won't you carry me to my little bed.""

So Bruin, who was a good-hearted soul, took him upon his back and rolled with him towards the house. And as he went on Reynard kept saying, ""The sick carries the sound, the sick carries the sound.""

""What's that you are saying?"" asked Bruin.

""Oh, I have no brains left, I do not know what I am saying,"" said Reynard but kept on singing, ""The sick carries the sound, ha, ha, the sick carries the sound.""

Then Bruin knew that he had been done and threw Reynard down upon the ground, and would have eaten him up but that the fox slunk away and rushed into a briar bush. Bruin followed him closely into the briar bush and caught Reynard's hind leg in his mouth. Then Reynard called out, ""That's right, you fool, bite the briar root, bite the briar root.""

Bruin thinking that he was biting the briar root, let go Reynard's foot and snapped at the nearest briar root. ""That's right, now you've got me, don't hurt me too much,"" called out Reynard, and slunk away. ""Don't hurt me too much, don't hurt me too much.""

When Bruin heard Reynard's voice dying away in the distance he knew that he had been done again, and that was the end of their partnership.

Some time after this a man was plowing in the field with his two oxen, who were very lazy that day. So the man called out at them, ""Get a move on or I'll give you to the bear""; and when they didn't quicken their pace he tried to frighten them by calling out, ""Bear, Bear, come and take these lazy oxen.""

Sure enough, Bruin heard him and came out of the woods and said, ""Here I am, give me the oxen, or else it'll be worse for you.""

The man was in despair but said, ""Yes, yes, of course they are yours, but please let me finish my morning's plowing so I may finish this acre.""

Bruin could not say ""No"" to that, and sat down licking his chops and waiting for the oxen. The man went on plowing, thinking what he should do, when just at the corner of the field Reynard came up to him and said, ""If you will give me two geese, I'll help you out of this fix and deliver the bear into your hands.""

The man agreed and he told him what to do and went away into the woods. Soon after, the bear and the man heard a noise like ""bow-wow, bow-wow""; and the Bear came to the man and said, ""What's that?""

""Oh, that must be the lord's hounds out hunting for bears.""

""Hide me, hide me,"" said Bruin, ""and I will let you off the oxen.""

Then Reynard called out from the wood, ""What's that black thing you've got there?""

And the Bear said, ""Say it's the stump of a tree.""

So when the man had called this out to the fox, Reynard called out, ""Put it in the cart; fix it with the chain; cut off the boughs, and drive your axe into the stump.""

Then the bear said to the man, ""Pretend to do what he bids you; heave me into the cart; bind me with the chain; pretend to cut off the boughs, and drive the axe into the stump.""

So the man lifted Bruin into the cart, bound him with the chain, then cut off his limbs and buried the axe in his head.

Then Reynard came forward and asked for his reward, and the man went back to his house to get the pair of geese that he had promised.

""Wife, wife,"" he called out, as he neared the house, ""get me a pair of geese, which I have promised the fox for ridding me of the bear.""

""I can do better than that,"" said his wife Ann, and brought him out a bag with two struggling animals in it.

""Give these to Master Reynard,"" said she; ""they will be geese enough for him."" So the man took the bag and went down to the field and gave the bag to Reynard, but when he opened it out sprang two hounds, and he had great trouble in running away from them to his den.

When he got to his den the fox asked each of his limbs, how they had helped him in his flight. His nose said, ""I smelt the hounds""; his eyes said, ""We looked for the shortest way""; his ears said, ""We listened for the breathing of the hounds""; and his legs said, ""We ran away with you.""

Then he asked his tail what it had done, and it said, ""Why, I got caught in the bushes or made your leg stumble; that is all I could do.""

So, as a punishment, the fox stuck his tail out of his den, and the hounds saw it and caught hold of it, and dragged the fox out of his den by it and ate him all up. So that was the end of Master Reynard, and well he deserved it. Don't you think so? ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
2,Why the Bear Has a Stumpy Tail,Flanders,"Flanders is the northern part of Belgium, where the native language is Flemish (Dutch). ","Jean de Bossch�re, Folk Tales of Flanders (New York: Dodd, Mean and Company, 1918), pp. 168-72. ","One very cold winter, when the ground was covered with snow and the ponds and rivers were frozen hard, Reynard the Fox and all the other animals went out to enjoy themselves by sliding and skating on the ice. After a time Reynard began to feel hungry, so he wandered off by himself in search of something to eat. He nosed about here, and he nosed about there; he lay in wait behind bushes in the hope of being able to catch a bird; he lurked by the walls of farmhouses ready to spring out upon any unsuspecting chicken that might show itself, but all in vain. The birds were wary, and the fowls were all safe in the hen houses.

Disappointed with his lack of success Reynard betook himself to the river, now covered with a glistening sheet of ice, and there, under the shelter of a bank, he found a hole in the ice which had not been frozen over. He sat down to watch the hole, and presently a little fish popped up its head for a breath of air. Reynard's paw darted, and the next moment the unfortunate creature lay gasping on the ice. Fish after fish the fox caught in this way, and when he had quite satisfied his hunger he strung the remainder on a stick and took his departure, not forgetting first of all to offer up a prayer for the repose of his victims.

He had not gone far before he met Mrs. Bruin, who had also come out in search of something to eat. When she saw Reynard with his fine catch of fish, she opened her eyes, I can tell you, and said, ""Wherever did you get all those fine fishes from, cousin? They make my mouth water! I am so hungry that I could bite the head off an iron nail!""

""Ah,"" said Reynard slyly, ""wouldn't you just like to know!""

""It is what I'm asking you,"" said Mrs. Bruin. ""You would surely not be so mean as to keep the good news to yourself!""

""I don't know so much about that,"" answered Reynard, ""but I have a certain fondness for you, cousin, so come along with me and I will show you the place where I caught the fish.""

Nothing loath, the bear followed, and presently they came to the hole in the ice.

""Do you see that hole, cousin?"" said Reynard. ""That is where the fish come up to breathe. All you have to do is to sit on the ice and let your tail hang down into the water. After a time the fish will come to bite at it, but don't you move. Sit quite still until the evening; then you will find a score of fishes on your tail and you can pull them out all together.""

Mrs. Bruin was delighted with the plan and immediately sat down and dipped her tail into the water.

""That's the way,"" said Reynard. ""Now I'll just be walking home to see to my dinner, but I'll be back presently. Be careful to keep quite still, or you ll spoil everything!""

So for the next three hours Mrs. Bruin sat on the ice with her tail in the water, and very cold it was, but she consoled herself with the thought of the delicious meal she would have when the fish were landed.

Reynard returned. "" Well, cousin,"" siad he, ""how do you feel?""

""Very cold,"" said Mrs. Bruin, with her teeth chattering. ""My tail is so numb that I hardly know I've got one!""

""Doe it feel heavy?"" asked Reynard anxiously.

""Very heavy,"" said Mrs. Bruin.

""There mus be hundreds of fish on it!"" said Reynard.

He left the bank and walked round the bear, observing that the water in the hole had frozen over, and the Mrs. Bruin's tail was hel firmly in the ice.

""I think you may safely pull up now,"" he went on, ""but you must be careful to land all the fish together. There is only one way to do that: you must give a strong, sharp, sudden pull and take them by surprise. Now then, are you ready? One, two, three . . . !""

At the word three Mrs. Bruin rose on her hind legs and gave a mighty jerk, but her tail was so firmly embedded in the ice that it would not come out.

""My word,"" cried Reynard, ""you have caught the whole river-full. Persevere, cousin now then, a long pull and a strong pull!""

""Ouf!"" grunted Mrs. Bruin, ""ouf, ouf . . . ah!""

And then she suddenly tumbled head over heels on the ice, as with one mighty jerk, she snapped her beautiful bushy tail clean off close to the roots.

When she had gathered her scattered wits together well enough to understand what had happened, she went to look for Reynard, but he had suddenly remembered an important engagement elsewhere, and was not to be found. And from that time down to this every bear has been born with a little stumpy tail. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

This story combines two tale types: ""The Theft of Fish"" (type 1). ""The Tail-Fisher"" (type 2). ","Ludwig Bechstein, ""Der Hase und der Fuchs,"" Ludwig Bechstein's Märchenbuch, illustrated by Ludwig Richter. 32nd edition (Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand, 1879), pp. 120-22. ","A hare and a fox were traveling together. It was wintertime. Nothing green was growing, and neither mice nor lice were creeping afield.

""This is hungry weather,"" said the fox to the hare. ""My insides are all knotted together.""

""Yes, indeed,"" answered the hare. ""There are hard times everywhere. I would eat my own ears if I could get them into my mouth.""

Thus they marched hungrily onward together. Then in the distance they saw a peasant girl approaching them. She was carrying a basket, and the fox and the hare sensed a pleasant smell coming from the basket, the smell of fresh bread rolls.

""Do you know what!"" said the fox. ""Lie down and pretend to be dead. The girl will set her basket down and pick you up for your poor pelt, because hare pelts can be made into gloves. Meanwhile I'll make off with the basket of rolls, all for our benefit.""

The hare did what the fox suggested: he fell down and pretended to be dead. The fox hid behind a snowdrift. The girl came and saw the hare with all four legs stretched out. She set down the basket, and bent over the hare. The fox quickly snatched up the basket and ran off across the field. The hare immediately came to life and hurried after his companion.

However, the fox showed no sign of sharing the rolls, but instead made it clear that he intended to eat all of them by himself. This did not please the hare at all.

They were approaching a small pond, and the hare said to the fox, ""Why don't we catch some fish for our meal? Then we could have fish with white bread, just like grand gentlemen! Just lower your tail into the water, then the fish, who themselves don't have much to eat these days, will grab onto it. But you'd better hurry, before the pond freezes over.""

The fox thought that this was a good plan, so he went to the pond, which was just about to freeze over, and hung his tail into the water. In a short time the fox's tail was frozen tightly in the ice. Then the hare took the basket of rolls and slowly ate them, one after the other, before the fox's eyes.

Finally he said to the fox, ""Just wait until it thaws! Just wait until springtime! Just wait until it thaws!""

And then he ran away, leaving the fox yelping after him, yelping like an angry dog on a chain. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","The wolf and the fox were traveling together. It was very cold.

The fox said, ""I have a good pelt, but I am still freezing.""

The wolf said, ""I have always heard that it is warm where the girls hang out. Let's go to the spinning room.""

The fox said, ""For all I care.""

So they went there, and the wolf began flirting with the girls, while the fox made himself comfortable next to the stove. He had a great appetite for something delicious. He crept around here and there, but couldn't sniff up anything. So he went outside, intending to take a boat ride. Someone was just passing by with a wagonload of herrings. The fox jumped onto the wagon, opened a tub, and threw out most of the herrings that were in it. Then he jumped down and ate up all the herrings, except for one.

He was about to bite into this last one when the wolf came up and said, ""What are you eating?""

The fox said, ""Fish. Do you want a taste?""

He gave the wolf half a herring, and it tasted very good to the wolf. He said, ""Where did you catch such a fish?""

The fox answered, ""Here in the pond.""

The wolf said, ""I would like to catch some.""

The fox said, ""Just hang your tail down into the water.""

However, it had turned cold, and the water stung the wolf's tail. After a while he wanted to pull his tail out, but the fox said, ""Test its weight!""

The wolf said, ""I don't notice anything.""

The fox said, ""Then it's too soon.""

Some time later he again wanted to pull his tail out, and the fox said, ""Test its weight!""

The wolf said, ""It seems that something is taking hold of it.""

The fox said, ""It's still too soon. Those are only little fish.""

By now the tail was nearly completely frozen into the ice.

Some time later the wolf once again wanted to pull his tail out, and the fox said, ""Test its weight!""

The wolf said, ""I seem to have caught a very large fish."" His tail was completely frozen into the ice.

The fox said, ""Pull!"" But however hard he pulled, he couldn't pull it out.

The fox said, ""Push with your feet! Push with your feet!"" And he went on his way.

The wolf pulled and pulled, and tugged and tugged, until finally he tore off his tail. This angered him greatly, and from that time onward he was always an enemy of the fox. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

Here the old man paused and glanced at the little boy, but it was evident that the youngster had become so accustomed to the marvelous developments of Uncle Remus's stories, that the extraordinary statement made no unusual impression upon him.

Therefore the old man began again, and this time in a louder arid more insinuating tone: ""One time ole man Rabbit, he wuz gwine 'long down de road shakin' his long, bushy tail, en feelin' mighty biggity.""

This was effective.

""Great goodness, Uncle Remus!"" exclaimed the little boy in open-eyed wonder, ""everybody knows that rabbits haven't got long, bushy tails.""

The old man shifted his position in his chair and allowed his venerable head to drop forward until his whole appearance was suggestive of the deepest dejection; and this was intensified by a groan that seemed to be the result of great mental agony. Finally he spoke, but not as addressing himself to the little boy.

""Ef I ain't fergit it off'n my mine, I say dat ole Brer Rabbit wuz gwine down de big road shakin' his long, bushy tail. Dat w'at I say, en dat I stan's by.""

They made one mokok (""bark box"") of sugar, and then they cached it away, burying it, and said to each other, ""We will let it remain here until we are very hungry.""

The younger man was a Fox, and he was a good hunter. Every time he went out, he brought home chickens or small wild game. The other man was a greedy Wolf, and he never killed anything, or brought anything home: so Fox thought he would play a trick on his chum for being lazy.

""You ought to go over to that house,"" said Fox to Wolf. ""Maybe they will give you something to eat. When I went over there, they gave me a chicken.""

So Wolf went over as he was told. When he got to the house, he did not hide himself, but went in open sight. The owner of the house saw the Wolf coming up, so he set his dogs on him to drive him away; and Wolf escaped only by running into the river.

""So it is this one that takes off our chickens!"" said the man.

When Wolf arrived at his home, he told his younger brother, Fox, ""Why, I hardly escaped from that man!""

""Why!"" said Fox to him. ""They did not recognize you; that's why."" But Wolf made no answer.

While they were in the house together, Fox went outside, and cried, ""He!"" to deceive Wolf.

""What's the matter with you?"" asked Wolf.

""Oh! they have come after me to give a name to a child.""

""Then you'd better go over. Maybe they will give you something to eat.""

Instead of going, however, Fox went to their cache of maple sugar, and ate some of it. When he returned, Wolf asked him, ""What did you name the baby?""

""Mokimon,"" replied Fox; and this word means to ""reveal"" or ""dig out"" something you have hidden.

At another time, while they were sitting together, Fox said, ""He!"" and ""Oh, yes!""

""What's that?"" inquired Wolf.

""Oh! I am called to give a name to a newborn baby.""

""Well, then, go. Maybe they will give you something to eat.""

So Fox went and returned. ""What's the name of the child?"" asked Wolf.

This time, Fox answered, ""Wapiton""; and this word means ""to commence to eat.""

At another time, Fox cried out, ""He!"" and ""All right!"" as though some one had called to him, ""I'll come.""

""What's that?"" asked Wolf.

""They want me to go over and name their child.""

""Well, then, go,"" says Wolf. ""You always get something to eat every time they want you.""

So Fox went, and soon returned. Wolf asked him again, ""What name did you give it?""

""Hapata kiton,"" answered Fox; that is to say, ""half eaten.""

Then another time Fox cried ""He!"" as if in answer to some one speaking to him, and then, as though some one called from the distance, ""Hau!""

Wolf, as he did not quite hear, asked Fox what the matter was. ""Oh, nothing!"" replied Fox, ""only they want me to come over and name their child.""

""Well, then, you'd better go. Maybe you'll get a chance to eat; maybe you'll fetch me something too.""

So Fox started out, and soon returned home.

""Well, what name did you give this time?"" asked Wolf.

""Noskwaton,"" said Fox; and this means ""all licked up.""

Then Wolf caught on. ""Maybe you are eating our stored maple sugar!"" he cried. But Fox sat still and laughed at him.

Then Wolf went over and looked at their cache. Sure enough, he found the empty box with its contents all gone, and pretty well licked up.

Meantime Fox skipped out, and soon found a large tree by the river, leaning out over the water. He climbed into its branches and hid there. Presently the angry Wolf returned home, and, not finding Fox, tracked him to the tree. Wolf climbed part way to Fox without seeing him, as he was on the branches. Then Wolf was afraid, and while he was hesitating, he happened to look at the water, and there he saw the reflection of Fox laughing at him on the surface. The Wolf, in a fury, plunged into the bottom of the stream, but of course failed to catch Fox. He tried four times, and after the fourth attempt he was tired, and quit jumping in for a while. While he was resting, he looked up and saw Fox laughing at him.

Then Wolf said to Fox, ""Let's go home and make up""; for he thought in his heart that anyway Fox was feeding him all the time.

By and by it became winter. Fox frequently went out, and returned with abundance of fish. ""How do you manage to get so many?"" asked Wolf.

""You'd better go out and try for yourself,"" said Fox. ""The way I do, when I am fishing, is to cut a hole in the ice. I put my tail in, instead of a line, and I remain there until I feel bites. I move ahead a little to let the fish string on my tail; but I stay a long time, until I get a great many fish on my tail. When it feels pretty heavy, I jerk it out, and catch all I want.""

Fox was in hopes that he could get Wolf frozen to death in the ice, and so avoid the necessity of feeding him any longer. So he took Wolf out, and cut five holes in the ice, -- one for his tail, and one for each paw, -- telling him he could catch more fish that way. Wolf staid there to fish all night. Every once in a while he would move his feet or tail a little, and they felt so heavy, he was sure he was getting a tremendous load; and he staid a little longer. In the mean time he was freezing fast in the ice. When he found out the predicament he was in, he jerked backwards and forwards again and again, until all the hair wore off his tail, and there he was. He thought he had let too many fish on his tail and feet to haul them out, and he worked hard to free himself. At last he wore his tail out at the surface of the ice, and pulled off his claws and the bottoms of his feet. Fox told him he had caught too many fish, and that they had bitten his tail and feet; and Wolf believed it.

Another time, Fox found a wasp's nest in a tree: so he went home and told Wolf that there was honey in it, and persuaded him to try and jump up and get it, on the plea that Wolf could jump higher than he could. As soon as Wolf set out to try, Fox ran away, and Wolf was nearly stung to death. Fox fled over a wagon-road to conceal his tracks, and as he travelled, he met a negro with a team, hauling a load of bread. Fox, cunning as he was, lay down on the side of the road and pretended that he was dead. The negro saw him lying there, and picked him up and put him in his wagon behind his load. Fox very presently came to, and, waiting for his chance, he would throw off a loaf of bread every now and then, till he had gotten rid of a good many. Then he jumped off, and carried the loaves to a secret place, where he built him a shelter, and prepared to live for a time.

In the meantime, Wolf came along, half starved, and crippled from his meddling with a live wasp's nest and from his fishing experience. Fox fed him on his arrival, and said, ""You ought to do the way I did. It's easy to get bread. I got mine by playing dead on the road. Tomorrow the negro will pass by with another load; and you can watch for him and do as I did, and steal his bread.""

Next morning, Wolf started out to watch the road, and pretty soon he saw the negro coming with a big load of bread: so he lay down beside the road, where the darky could see him, and played dead. The darky did see him, sure enough; and he stopped his team, and got off and got a big stick, and knocked Wolf over the head, and killed him dead for sure.

""I will not get fooled this time!"" he said, ""for yesterday I lost too many loaves of bread for putting a dead Fox in my wagon without examining him.""

So he did take the Wolf home dead. That ended him, and since then Fox has eaten alone. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

545B,Costantino and His Cat,Fiovanni Francesco Straparola,,"Giovanni Francesco StraparolaThe Facetious Nights of Straparola, vol. 4 (London: Privately printed for members of the Society of Bibliophiles, 1901), night 11, tale 1, pp. 6-18. ","Fioriana dies and leaves three sons, Dusolino, Tesifone, and Costantino. The last-named, by the aid of his cat, gains the lordship of a powerful kingdom. 

It is no rare event, beloved ladies, to see a rich man brought to extreme poverty, or to find one who from absolute penury has mounted to high estate. And this last-named fortune befell a poor wight of whom I have heard tell, who from being little better than a beggar attained the full dignity of a king.

There was once upon a time in Bohemia a woman, Soriana by name, who lived in great poverty with her three sons, of whom one was called Dusolino, and another Tesifone, and the third Costantino Fortunato. Soriana had naught of any value in the way of household goods save three things, and these were a kneading trough of the kind women use in the making of bread, a board such as is used in the preparation of pastry, and a cat. Soriana, being now borne down with a very heavy burden of years, saw that death was approaching her, and on this account made her last testament, leaving to Dusolino, her eldest son, the kneading trough, to Tesifone the paste board, and to Costantino the cat.

When the mother was dead and duly buried, the neighbors round about would borrow now the kneading trough and now the paste board, as they might happen to want them, and as they knew that the young men were very poor, they gave them by way of repayment a cake, which Dusolino and Tesifone ate by themselves, giving nothing of it to Costantino, the youngest brother. And if Costantino chanced to ask them to give him aught they would make answer by bidding him to go to his cat, who would without fail let him have what he wanted, and on this account poor Costantino and his cat underwent much suffering.

Now it chanced that this cat of Costantino's was a fairy in disguise, and the cat, feeling much compassion for him and anger at his two brothers on account of their cruel treatment of him, one day said to him, ""Costantino, do not be cast down, for I will provide for your well-being and sustenance, and for my own as well.""

Whereupon the cat sallied forth from the house and went into the fields, where it lay down and feigned to be asleep so cleverly that an unsuspecting leveret came close up to where it was lying, and was forthwith seized and killed. Then, carrying the leveret, the cat went to the king's palace, and having met some of the courtiers who were standing about it, said that it wanted to speak to the king.

When the king heard that a cat had begged an audience with him, he bade them bring it into his presence, and, having asked it what its business was, the cat replied that Costantino, its master, had sent a leveret as a present to the king, and begged his gracious acceptance of the same. And with these words it presented the leveret to the king, who was pleased to accept it, asking at the same time who this Costantino might be. The cat replied that he was a young man who for virtue and good looks had no superior, and the king, on hearing this report, gave the cat a kindly welcome, and ordered them to set before it meat and drink of the best. The cat, when it had eaten and drunk enough, dexterously filled the bag in which it had brought the leveret with all sorts of good provender, when no one was looking that way, and having taken leave of the king, carried the spoil back to Costantino.

The two brothers, when they saw Costantino making good cheer over the victuals, asked him to let them have a share, but he paid them back in their own coin, and refused to give them a morsel, wherefore on this account the brothers hereafter were tormented with gnawing envy of Costantino's good fortune.

Now Costantino, though he was a good-looking youth, had suffered so much privation and distress that his face was rough and covered with blotches, which caused him much discomfort; so the cat, having taken him one day down to the river, washed him and licked him carefully with its tongue from head to foot, and tended him so well that in a few days he was quite freed from his ailment.

The cat still went on carrying presents to the royal palace in the fashion already described, and by these means got a living for Costantino. But after a time the cat began to find these journeyings to and from the palace somewhat irksome, and it feared more over that the king's courtiers might be come impatient thereanent; so it said to Costantino, ""My master, if you will only do what I shall tell you, in a short time you will find yourself a rich man.""

""And how will you manage this?"" said Costantino.

Then the cat answered, ""Come with me, and do not trouble yourself about anything, for I have a plan for making a rich man of you which cannot fail.""

Whereupon the cat and Costantino betook themselves to a spot on the bank of the river which was hard by the king's palace, and forthwith the cat bade its master to strip off all his clothes and to throw himself into the river.

Then it began to cry and shout in a loud voice, ""Help, help, run, run, for Messer Costantino is drowning!""

It happened that the king heard what the cat was crying out, and bearing in mind what great benefits he had received from Costantino, he immediately sent some of his household to the rescue.

When Costantino had been dragged out of the water and dressed by the attendants in seemly garments, he was led into the presence of the king, who gave him a hearty welcome, and inquired of him how it was that he found himself in the water; but Costantino, on account of his agitation, knew not what reply to make; so the cat, who always kept at his elbow, answered in his stead, ""You must know, O king! that some robbers, who had learned by the agency of a spy that my master was taking a great store of jewels to offer them to you as a present, laid wait for him and robbed him of his treasure, and then, wishing to murder him, they threw him into the river, but by the aid of these gentlemen he has escaped death.""

The king, when he heard this, gave orders that Costantino should enjoy the best of treatment, and seeing that he was well made and handsome, and believing him to be very rich, he made up his mind to give him his daughter Elisetta to wife, and to endow her with a rich dowry of gold and jewels and sumptuous raiment. When the nuptial ceremonies were completed and the festivities at an end, the king bade them load ten mules with gold and five with the richest garments, and sent the bride, accompanied by a great concourse of people, to her husband's house.

Costantino, when he saw himself so highly honored and loaded with riches, was in sore perplexity as to where he should carry his bride, and took counsel with the cat thereanent.

Said the cat: ""Be not troubled over this business, my master; we will provide for everything.""

So as they were all riding on merrily together the cat left the others and rode on rapidly in advance, and after it had left the company a long way behind, it came upon certain cavaliers whom it thus addressed: ""Alas! you poor fellows, what are you doing here? Get hence as quickly as you can, for a great body of armed men is coming along this road and will surely attack and despoil you. See, they are now quite near; listen to the noise of the neighing horses.""

Whereupon the horsemen, overcome with fear, said to the cat: ""What then shall we do?""

And the cat made answer: ""It will be best for you to act in this wise. If they should question you as to whose men you are, you must answer boldly that you serve Messer Costantino, and then no one will molest you.""

Then the cat left them, and, having ridden on still farther, came upon great flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and it told the same story and gave the same counsel to the shepherds and drovers who had charge of these. Then going on still farther it spake in the same terms to whomsoever it chanced to meet. As the cavalcade of the princess passed on, the gentlemen who were accompanying her asked of the horsemen whom they met the name of their lord, and of the herdsmen who might be the owner of all these sheep and oxen, and the answer given by all was that they served Messer Costantino.

Then the gentlemen of the escort said to the bridegroom: ""So, Messer Costantino, it appears we are now entering your dominions?"" and Costantino nodded his head in token of assent, and in like manner he made answer to all their interrogations, so that all the company on this account judged him to be enormously rich.

In the meantime the cat had ridden on and had come to a fair and stately castle, which was guarded by a very weak garrison, and these defenders the cat addressed in the following words: ""My good men, what is it you do? Surely you must be aware of the ruin which is about to overwhelm you.""

""What is the ruin you speak of?"" demanded the guards.

""Why, before another hour shall have gone by,"" replied the cat, ""your place will be beleaguered by a great company of soldiers, who will cut you in pieces. Do you not already hear the neighing of the horses and see the dust in the air? Wherefore, unless you are minded to perish, take heed to my advice, which will bring you safely out of all danger. For if anyone shall demand of you whose this castle is, say that it belongs to Messer Costantino Fortunato.""

And when the time came the guards gave answer as the cat had directed; for when the noble escort of the bride had arrived at the stately castle, and certain gentlemen had inquired of the guards the name of the lord of the castle, they were answered that it was Messer Costantino Fortunato; and when the whole company had entered the castle they were honorably lodged therein.

Now the lord of this castle was a certain Signor Valentino, a very brave soldier, who only a few days ago had left his castle to bring back thereto the wife he had recently espoused, but as ill fortune would have it, there happened to him on the road, somewhile before he came to the place where his beloved wife was abiding, an unhappy and unforeseen accident by which he straightway met his death. So Costantino Fortunato retained the lordship of Valentino's castle.

Not long after this Morando, King of Bohemia, died, and the people by acclamation chose Costantino Fortunato for their king, seeing that he had espoused Elisetta, the late king's daughter, to whom by right the succession to the kingdom belonged. And by these means Costantino rose from an estate of poverty or even beggary to be a powerful king, and lived long with Elisetta his wife, leaving children by her to be the heirs of his kingdom.

545B,Gagliuso,Giambattista Basile,"Basile's Lo cunto de li cunti overo lo trattenemiento de peccerille (The Tale of Tales; or, Entertainment for Little Ones, also known as Il Pentamerone) was first published in two volumes in Naples between 1634 and 1636. ","Giambattista Basile, The Pentamerone; or, The Story of Stories, translated from the Neapolitan by John Edward Taylor; new edition revised and edited by Helen Zimmern (New York: Macmilland and Company; London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1894), pp. 80-87. ","There was one time in my dear city of Naples an old man who was as poor as poor could be. He was so wretched, so bare, so light, and with not a farthing in his pocket, that he went naked as a flea.

And being about to shake out the bags of life, he called to him his sons, Oratiello and Pippo, and said to them, ""I am now called upon by the tenor of my bill to pay the debt I owe to nature; and believe me I should feel great pleasure in leaving this abode of misery, but that I leave you here behind me, a pair of miserable fellows, without a stitch upon your backs, without so much as a fly can carry upon its foot; so that were you to run a hundred miles, not a farthing would drop from you. My ill fortune has indeed brought me to such beggary that I lead the life of a dog; for I have all along, as you well know, gaped with hunger and gone to bed without a candle. Nevertheless, now that I am dying, I wish to leave you some token of my love. So do you, Oratiello, who are my first-born, take the sieve that hangs yonder against the wall, with which you can earn your bread; and do you, little fellow, take the cat, and remember your daddy.""

So saying he began to whimper, and presently after said, ""God be with you, for it is night!""

Oratiello had his father buried by charity, and then took the sieve, and went riddling [sifting] here and there and everywhere to gain a livelihood; and the more he riddled the more he earned.

And Pippo, taking the cat, said, ""Only see now what a pretty legacy my father has left me! I, who am not able to support myself, must now provide for two. Whoever beheld such a miserable inheritance?""

But the cat, who overheard this lamentation, said to him, ""You are grieving without need, and have more luck than sense; but you little know the good fortune in store for you, and that I am able to make you rich if I set about it.""

When Pippo heard this, he thanked her pussyship, stroked her three or four times on the back, and commended himself warmly to her.

So the cat took compassion upon poor Gagliuso, and every morning she betook herself either to the shore of the Chiaja or to the Fishrock, and catching a goodly gray mullet, or a fine dory, she bagged it, and carried it to the king, and said, ""My lord Gagliuso, your majesty's most humble slave, sends you this fish with all reverence, and says, ""A small present to a great lord.'""

Then the king with a joyful face, as one usually shows to those who bring a gift, answered the cat, ""Tell this lord, whom I do not know, that I thank him heartily.""

At another time the cat would run to the marshes or fields, and when the fowlers had brought down a blackbird, a snipe, or a lark, she caught it up, and presented it to the king with the same message.

She repeated this trick again and again, until one morning the king said to her, ""I feel infinitely obliged to this lord Gagliuso, and am desirous of knowing him, that I may make a return for the kindness he has shown me.""

And the cat replied, The desire of my lord Gagliuso is to give his life and blood for your majesty's crown, and tomorrow morning without fail, as soon as the sun has set fire to the stubble of the fields of air, he will come and pay his respects to you.""

So when the morning came the cat went to the king, and said to him, ""Sire, my lord Gagliuso sends to excuse himself for not coming; as last night some of his servants robbed him and ran off, and have not left him a single shirt to his back.""

When the king heard this, he instantly commanded his servants to take out of his wardrobe a quantity of clothes and linen, and sent them to Gagliuso; and before two hours had passed Gagliuso went to the palace, conducted by the cat, where he received a thousand compliments from the king, who made him sit beside him, and gave him a banquet that would amaze you.

While they were eating Gagliuso from time to time turned to the cat, and said to her, ""My pretty puss, prithee take care that those rags don't slip through our fingers.""

Then the cat answered, ""Be quiet, be quiet; don't be talking of these beggarly things.""

The king wishing to know what it was, the cat made answer that he had taken a fancy for a small lemon, whereupon the king instantly set out to the garden for a basketful. But Gagliuso returned to the same tune about the old clothes and shirts, and the cat again told him to hold his tongue. Then the king once more asked what was the matter, and the cat had another excuse ready to make amends for Gagliuso's rudeness.

At last when they had eaten and had chatted for some time of one thing and another, Gagliuso took his leave; and the cat stayed with the king, describing the worth, and the genius, and the judgment of Gagliuso, and, above all, the great wealth he had in the plains of Rome and Lombardy, which well entitled him to marry into the family of a crowned king.

Then the king asked what might be his fortune; and the cat replied that no one could ever count the movables, the immovables, and the household furniture of this immensely rich man, who did not even know what he possessed; and if the king wished to be informed of it, he had only to send people with her out of the kingdom, and she would prove to him that there was no wealth in the world equal to his.

Then the king called some trusty persons, and commanded them to inform themselves minutely of the truth; so they followed in the footsteps of the cat, who, as soon as they had passed the frontier of the kingdom, from time to time ran on before, under the pretext of providing refreshments for them on the road; and whenever she met a flock of sheep, a herd of cows, a troop of horses, or a drove of pigs, she would say to the herdsmen and keepers, ""Ho! Have a care! There's a troop of robbers coming to carry off everything in the country. So if you wish to escape their fury, and to have your things respected, say that they all belong to the lord Gagliuso, and not a hair will be touched.""

She said the same at all the farmhouses that she passed on the road; so that wherever the king's people came, they found the pipe tuned; for everything they met with, they were told, belonged to the lord Gagliuso. So at last they were tired of asking, and went back to the king, telling seas and mountains of the riches of lord Gagliuso. The king, hearing this report, promised the cat a good drink if she should manage to bring about the match; and the cat concluded the marriage. So Gagliuso came, and the king gave him his daughter and a large portion.

At the end of a month of festivities Gagliuso said he wished to take his bride to his estates; so the king accompanied them as far as the frontiers, and he went to Lombardy, where, by the cat's advice, he purchased a quantity of lands and territories, and became a baron.

Gagliuso, now seeing himself so extremely rich, thanked the cat more than words can express, saying that he owed his life and his greatness to her good offices, and that the ingenuity of a cat had done more for him than the wit of his father; therefore she might dispose of his life and property as she pleased; and he gave her his word that when she died, which he prayed might not be for a hundred years, he would have her embalmed and put into a golden coffin, and set in his own chamber, that he might keep her memory always before his eyes.

The cat listened to these lavish professions, and before three days were over she pretended to be dead, and stretched herself at her full length in the garden; and when Gagliuso's wife saw her, she cried out, ""O husband, what a sad misfortune! The cat is dead!""

""Devil die with her!"" said Gagliuso. ""Better she than we!""

""What shall we do with her?"" asked the wife.

""Take her by the leg,"" said he, ""and fling her out of the window.""

Then the cat, who heard this fine reward when she least expected it, began to say, ""Is this the return you make for my taking you from beggary? Is this the thanks I get for freeing you from rags that you might have hung distaffs with? Is this my reward for having put good clothes on your back, and fed you well when you were a poor, starved, miserable, tatter-brogued ragamuffin? But such is the fate of him who washes an ass's head. Go, a curse upon all I have done for you! You are not worth spitting upon in the face. A fine gold coffin you had prepared for me! A fine funeral you were going to give me! Go now, serve, labor, toil, sweat, to get this fine reward! Unhappy is he who does a good deed in hopes of a return! Well was it said by the philosopher, 'He who lies down an ass, an ass he finds himself.' But let him who does most expect least. Smooth words and ill deeds deceive alike both wise and fools.""

So saying she threw her cloak about her, and went her way; and all that Gagliuso with the utmost humility could do to soothe her was of no avail. She would not return, but kept running on without ever turning her head about, and saying,

Heaven protect us from a rich man grown poor, And from a beggar who of wealth has got store.

The poor cat was compassionated beyond measure for seeing herself so ill rewarded; but one of those present observed, that she might have found some consolation in not being alone; for at the present day ingratitude has become a domestic evil; and there are many others also who, after they have worked and toiled, and spent their money, and ruined their health, to serve this race of ungrateful people, and have fancied them selves sure of another and a better reward than a golden coffin, find themselves destined to be buried in the hospital.

545B,"The Master Cat; or, Puss in Boots",Charles Perrault,Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps passé (Stories or Tales from Past Times) -- also titled Les conte de ma Mère l'Oye (Tales of My Mother Goose) -- was first published in Paris in 1697. ,"Charles Perrault Tales of Passed Times (London: J. M. Dent and Company, 1900), pp. 43-51. ","A miller bequeathed to his three sons all he possessed of worldly goods, which consisted only of his mill, his ass, and his cat. It did not take long to divide the property, and neither notary nor attorney was called in; they would soon have eaten up the poor little patrimony. The eldest son had the mill; the second son, the ass; and the youngest had nothing but the cat.

The latter was very disconsolate at having such a poor share of the inheritance. ""My brothers,"" said he, ""may be able to earn an honest livelihood by entering into partnership; but, as for me, when I have eaten my cat and made a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.""

The cat, who had heard this speech, although he had not appeared to do so, said to him with a sedate and serious air, ""Do not be troubled, master; you have only to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me in which I can go among the bushes, and you will see that you are not left so badly off as you believe.""

Though his master did not place much reliance on the cat's words, he had seen him play such cunning tricks in catching rats and mice, when he would hang himself up by the heels, or hide in the ?our pretending to be dead, that he was not altogether without hope of being helped by him out of his distress.

As soon as the cat had what he asked for, he boldly pulled on his boots, and, hanging his bag round his neck, he took the strings of it in his forepaws, and started off for a warren where there were a great number of rabbits. He put some bran and sow-thistles in his bag, and then, stretching himself out as if he were dead, he waited till some young rabbit, little versed in the wiles of the world, should come and poke his way into the bag, in order to eat what was inside it.

He had hardly laid himself down before he had the pleasure of seeing a young scatterbrain of a rabbit get into the bag, whereupon Master Cat pulled the strings, caught it, and killed it without mercy. Proud of his prey, he went to the palace, and asked to speak to the king.

He was ushered upstairs and into the state apartment, and, after making a low bow to the king, he said, ""Sire, here is a wild rabbit, which my Lord the Marquis of Carabas -- for such was the title he had taken a fancy to give to his master -- has ordered me to present, with his duty, to your majesty.""

""Tell your master,"" replied the king, ""that I thank him and am pleased with his gift.""

Another day he went and hid himself in the wheat, keeping the mouth of his bag open as before, and as soon as he saw that a brace of partridges had run inside, he pulled the strings, and so took them both. He went immediately and presented them to the king, as he had the rabbits. The king was equally grateful at receiving the brace of partridges, and ordered drink to be given him.

For the next two or three months, the cat continued in this manner, taking presents of game at intervals to the king, as if from his master.

One day, when he knew the king was going to drive on the banks of the river, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master, ""If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made; you have only to go and bathe in a part of the river I will point out to you, and then leave the rest to me.""

The Marquis of Carabas did as his cat advised him, without knowing what good would come of it.

While he was bathing, the king passed by, and the cat began to call out with all his might, ""Help! Help! My lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!""

Hearing the cry, the king looked out of the coach window, and recognizing the cat who had so often brought him game, he ordered his guards to ?y to the help of my lord the Marquis of Carabas. Whilst they were getting the poor marquis out of the river, the cat went up to the royal coach, and told the king that, while his master had been bathing, some robbers had come and carried off his clothes, although he had shouted, ""Stop thief,"" as loud as he could. The rogue had hidden them himself under a large stone. The king immediately ordered the officers of his wardrobe to go and fetch one of his handsomest suits for my lord the Marquis of Carabas. The king embraced him a thousand times, and as the ?ne clothes they dressed him in set off his good looks -- for he was handsome and well made -- the Marquis of Carabas quite took the fancy of the king's daughter, and after he had cast two or three respectful and rather tender glances towards her, she fell very much in love with him. The king insisted upon his getting into the coach, and accompanying them in their drive.

The cat, delighted to see that his plans were beginning to succeed, ran on before, and coming across some peasants who were mowing a meadow, he said to them, ""You, good people, who are mowing here, if you do not tell the king that this meadow you are mowing belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be cut in pieces as small as minced meat.""

The king did not fail to ask the peasants whose meadow it was they were mowing.

""It belongs to my Lord the Marquis of Carabas,"" said they all together, for the cat's threat had frightened them.

""You have a ?ne property there,"" said the king to the Marquis of Carabas.

""As you say, sire,"" responded the Marquis of Carabas, ""for it is a meadow which yields an abundant crop every year.""

Master Cat, who still kept in advance of the party, came up to some reapers, and said to them, ""You, good people, who are reaping, if you do not say that all this corn belongs to my lord the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all be cut into pieces as small as minced meat.""

The king, who passed by a minute afterwards, wished to know to whom belonged all the corn ?elds he saw.

""To my lord the Marquis of Carabas,"" repeated the reapers, and the king again congratulated the Marquis on his property.

The cat, still continuing to run before the coach, uttered the same threat to everyone he met, and the king was astonished at the great wealth of my lord the Marquis of Carabas. Master Cat at length arrived at a ?ne castle, the owner of which was an ogre, the richest ogre ever known, for all the lands through which the king had driven belonged to the lord of this castle. The cat took care to ?nd out who the ogre was, and what he was able to do; then he asked to speak with him, saying that he did not like to pass so near his castle without doing himself the honor of paying his respects to him. The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre can, and made him sit down.

""I have been told,"" said the cat, ""that you have the power of changing yourself into all kinds of animals; that you could, for instance, transform yourself into a lion or an elephant.""

""'Tis true,"" said the ogre, abruptly, ""and to prove it to you, you shall see me become a lion.""

The cat was so frightened when he saw a lion in front of him, that he quickly scrambled up into the gutter, not without difficulty and danger, on account of his boots, which were worse than useless for walking on the tiles. Shortly afterwards, seeing that the ogre had resumed his natural form, the cat climbed down again, and admitted that he had been terribly frightened.

""I have also been assured,"" said the cat, "" but I cannot believe it, that you have the power besides of taking the form of the smallest animal; for instance, that of a rat, or a mouse; I confess to you I hold this to be utterly impossible.""

""Impossible!"" exclaimed the ogre, ""You shall see!"" and he immediately changed himself into a mouse, and began running about the ?oor.

The cat no sooner caught sight of it, than he pounced upon it and ate it.

In the meanwhile, the king, seeing the ?ne castle of the ogre as he was driving past, thought he should like to go inside.

The cat, who heard the noise of the coach rolling over the draw-bridge, ran to meet it, and said to the king, ""Your majesty is welcome to the Castle of my Lord the Marquis of Carabas!""

""How, my Lord Marquis,"" exclaimed the king, ""this castle belongs to you? Nothing could be ?ner than this courtyard, and all these buildings which surround it. Let us see the inside of it, if you please.""

The marquis handed out the young princess, and following the king, who led the way upstairs, they entered a grand hall, where they found prepared a magni?cent repast, which the ogre had ordered in expectation of some friends, who were to have visited him that very day, but who did not venture to enter when they heard the king was there.

The king, as greatly delighted with the excellent qualities of my Lord the Marquis of Carabas as his daughter, who was more than ever in love with him, seeing what great wealth he possessed, said to him, after having drunk ?ve or six bumpers, ""It depends entirely on yourself, my Lord Marquis, whether or not you become my son-in-law.""

The marquis, making several profound bows, accepted the honor the king offered him, and that same day was married to the princess. The cat became a great lord, and never again ran after mice, except for his amusement.

        Be the advantage never so great
        Of owning a superb estate,
        From sire to son descended,
        Young men oft find, on industry,
        Combined with ingenuity,
        They'd better have depended.
        If the son of a miller so quickly could gain
        The heart of a princess, it seems pretty plain,
        With good looks and good manners, and some aid from dress,
        The humblest need not quite despair of success. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, ""What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds."" The crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the fox, snatching it up, said, ""You have a voice, madam, I see. What you want is wits."" ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
675,Hans Dumb,Germany,"This story was not included in later editions of the Grimms' famous collection. Translated by D. L. Ashliman. © 2011. The episode of the golden goblet planted in the father's pocket is reminiscent of the Bible story of Joseph, who had a silver goblet planted in his brother Benjamin's pack. (Genesis, chapters 44-45) ","Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Hans Dumm,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, 1st ed., vol. 1 (Berlin: Realschulbuchhandlung, 1812), no. 54, pp. 250-52. ","There was a king who lived happily with his daughter, his only child. Quite suddenly the princess had a baby, but no one knew who the father was. For some time the king was beside himself. Finally he ordered the princess to take the child to the church. A lemon would be placed in his hand, and whoever he should give it to would be the child's father and the princess's husband. This happened, but only fine people were admitted into the church. However, in the town there was a small, crooked, hunchbacked lad who was not very smart and who was therefore known as Hans Dumb. He mingled with the others and slipped into the church without being seen. When the child reached out with the lemon, it was to Hans Dumb!

The princess was horrified, and the king was so taken aback that he had her, the child, and Hans Dumb placed into a cask and set adrift at sea. The cask soon drifted away, and when they were alone at sea the princess cried out bitterly, ""You horrid, hunchbacked, impudent rogue, you are the cause of my suffering. Why did you force your way into the church? You have nothing to do with the child.""

""Oh yes,"" said Hans Dumb. ""I have a lot to do with it, because one day I wished that you would have a child, and my wishes come true.""

""If that is so, then wish us something to eat.""

""I can do that too,"" said Hans Dumb, and he wished for a plate filled with potatoes. The princess would have liked something better, but because she was so hungry she helped him eat the potatoes.

After they had eaten their fill, Hans Dumb said, ""Now I shall wish us a fine ship!"" He had scarcely said this and they were sitting in a splendid ship, with an excess of everything that they might want.

The helmsman steered straight for land, and as they were going ashore Hans Dumb said, ""Here there shall be a castle!"" And there was a splendid castle there, and servants dressed in gold came and led the princess and the child inside, and when they were in the middle of the great hall, Hans Dumb said, ""Now I wish to become a young and intelligent prince!"" Then his hump disappeared, and he was handsome and straight and friendly. He found favor with the princess, and he became her husband, and they lived happily for a long time.

One day the old king got lost while out riding and came to their castle. He was amazed, because he had never seen it before, and he went inside. The princess recognized her father at once, but he did not know who she was, for he thought that she had long since drowned in the ocean. She received him with splendor, but when he wanted to go back home, she secretly placed a golden goblet into his pocket.

After he had ridden away she sent some knights after him to stop him and see if he hadn't stolen the golden goblet. They found it in his pocket and brought him back. He swore to the princess that he had not stolen it and did not know how it came to be in his pocket.

She said, ""You see, one should always be cautious about accusing another person."" With this she revealed herself as his daughter. The king was overjoyed, and they lived happily together, and after his death Hans Dumb became king. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
675,Stupid Michel,Germany,"Kuhn's source: ""Oral, from Brodewin [now spelled Brodowin]."" ","Adalbert Kuhn, ""Der dumme Michel,"" M�rkische Sagen und M�rchen (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1843), pp. 270-73. ","Once upon a time there was a peasant woman who had a son named Michel who never got further from the table than the tile stove.

Finally she decided that she would have to send him out into the world, so she said to him, ""Michel, go out to the pond and fetch some water.""

""Yes,"" said Michel, ""but just where is the pond?""

""Go out the front door, walk down the garden path, and you will see it to the left.""

Michel set forth at once and actually found the front door, the garden path, and the pond. When he pulled the bucket from the pond a large pike jumped out of it, and asked Michel to throw him back into the water, and he would reward him greatly.

""Did I tell you to jump out of the bucket?"" asked Michel. ""You can jump back into the water by yourself!""

The pike continued to beg, finally promising Michel that all his wishes would come true if he would throw him back into the water. Michel did just that, then picked up the bucket and returned home.

Now while at the pond in the distance he had seen a house that glistened magnificently like pure silver and gold, so he asked his mother, ""Mother, what kind of a house is the one that I saw from the pond?""

His mother said, ""That is the king's house. He lives there with the beautiful princess.""

When Michel heard that a beautiful princess lived there, he thought, ""I will see if the pike told me the truth. I wish that the princess should become pregnant.""

Not long afterward the princess did indeed become pregnant, and when the king discovered this he became very angry and reprimanded her bitterly. But she swore sincerely that no one had been with her; it must have happened while she was asleep. However, the kind did not believe her.

With time she gave birth to a boy, and because the father's name was not known, he was named after his grandfather.

When the boy grew older he noticed that his grandfather was not his father, and he asked, ""Tell me, who is my father?""

The grandfather answered, ""You do not have a father.""

""How can I not have a father?"" replied the boy. ""Everyone has a father. You just don't know who mine is!""

Then the old king had to admit that he did have a father, but that no one knew who he was.

Then the boy said, ""Let's give a large feast, and I'll find out who he is.""

The king did just that, and all the ministers, generals, and such people within the king's realm came, and the boy mingled among them, carefully looking at each one. Finally he went back to the king and said, ""My father is not here. You will have to give a larger feast.""

So the king invited all of his officers and councilors and even some of the most prominent citizens to come together, and once the boy mingled among them, examining each one. But he did not find his father, and he said to the king, ""You must give a feast for everyone, and then I will find my father.""

Then all the citizens and peasants from the entire land were invited to come together. When Michel's mother heard about this she said, ""Michel, you too must go to the castle. The king is giving a general feast.""

Now Michel had only a dirty, tarry jacket and an old three-cornered hat, but his mother made him look as good as possible, and he went to the court. After everyone had gathered together in a large group, the boy ran quickly among them, and before long he stopped next to Michel in his tarry jacket and three-cornered hat.

Taking Michel by the hand, the boy led him to the king and said, ""This is my father!""

At first the king did not want to believe this, and he told the boy that he must be mistaken, but the boy insisted that Michel was his father.

Finally, beside himself with anger, the king said that he would neither accept the father, nor the mother, nor the child. Forthwith he had a large glass ball made with a lid that one could open and close. He had his daughter, Michel, and the boy put inside, then set it adrift on the open sea.

After they had drifted for some distance, with the princess sitting there bemoaning the fact that they had found such a father for her child, and that now they would miserably perish, Michel wished that they would come ashore on an island, and immediately the ball hit solid ground, and they all climbed out safely.

Then Michel wished for a magnificent castle with the best servants and all the houses that belonged to such a place, and immediately everything was there.

Now the princess was happier. Then Michel wished magnificent clothes for himself. Thus he lived here happily with his wife and his child for a long time.

Finally the princess grew lonely for her father and her homeland, and she told this to her husband, so he wished for a bridge to her father's kingdom, and immediately one was there, and indeed it had one railing of gold and the other of silver. Then they flew across the water in a golden coach to her father's castle. His anger disappeared when he discovered how well off his daughter now was, and they all lived happily and satisfied until they died. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

Stroebe's source: Jens Kamp, ""Doven Lars, der fik Prinsessen,"" Danske Folkæventyr (Copenhagen: Fr. Wøldikes Forlag, 1879), no. 15, pp. 160-69.  Kamp recorded this tale from an unidentified informant on the island of Bogø. ","Klara Stroebe, ""Der faule Lars, der die Prinzessin bekam,"" Nordische Volksmärchen. 1. Teil: Dänemark und Schweden (Jena: Eugen Diederichs, 1922), no. 30, pp. 142-49. ","Once upon a time there was a very poor couple who lived not far from the king's castle. They had but one son, and he was not very promising, for he was so terribly lazy that the grass had plenty of time to grow beneath his feet. If you asked him to have a seat, you would be sure to find him later in the same spot. His name was Lars, and no one called him anything but Lazy Lars.

His parents worked every day up at the castle. His mother helped out in the kitchen and the father in the garden. Lars stayed at home the whole day doing nothing but turning into a complete lazybones.

One day at noon his mother came home to fix something to eat for herself and the boy. She was about to hang the pot over the fire, but there was no water in the house. They didn't have a well, so they had to fetch their water from a spring on the other side of the castle.

The mother said, ""Listen, Lazy Lars, run and fetch a little water from the spring, or there will be nothing for you to eat.""

""I'm going,"" said Lars, but he did not move from where he was sitting. She said it once again, and he gave her the same answer, but he did not move at all. Then the mother became angry and reached for the poker to teach Lazy Lars a lesson with it, so he had to get up after all.

He took an old broad-brimmed hat and an old iron kettle whose feet had been knocked off and went on his way. But it was a slow trip, because the day was very hot and every few moments he turned the kettle upside down and sat on it for a while.

As he was passing the castle it happened that the king's daughter, a young and spirited princess, was sitting at a window, and when she saw Lazy Lars, whom she knew well, and observed the trip he was making with the kettle, she broke out laughing and called down to him, ""Where are you going, Lazy Lars?""

""To the spring to fetch water,"" he shouted.

""Hurry up, Lazy Lars, or else your kettle without legs will run away from you!"" she called back.

Lars answered that there was no danger of that.

""You are going to need a boy to help you carry your kettle, Lazy Lars,"" she shouted haughtily.

It made Lars angry that she was thus making fun of him, and he looked up toward the window. He had never before seen such a beautiful girl, and he was so taken back that he just stood there with his mouth open staring at her. She laughed at him even more and shouted, ""Close your mouth, Lazy Lars, or your heart will get cold!""

Then Lars picked up his feet and did not stop again to rest until he came to the spring.

There he took a string, tied it to the handle of the kettle, and lowered it into the spring. The kettle filled with water, but when he pulled it back up there was a frog in it, and the frog could talk. Lars had never seen anything like this before. He set the kettle on the ground and looked in amazement at the frog, who asked him very politely if he could not be put back into the spring. But Lazy Lars said that that would not be possible, for it would be double the effort. The frog again asked politely, promising Lars that he could have one wish granted, if he would but put him back into the water.

Lars thought that that would not be bad. He took his old broad-brimmed hat and threw it onto the ground, then said that he wanted to have as many wishes granted as there were blades of grass covered by the hat, for he thought it would be all the same to the frog if he was going to the trouble to grant a wish.

So the frog was able to return to the spring and was happy about that.

Lars sat down next to his kettle, which he had filled up again, in order to take his time and think about what he should fish for. Of course, he thought that the first thing he should wish for would be that his kettle should get some legs and be able to walk, so he would not have to carry it. Then the princess would not be able to laugh at his kettle, saying that it had no feet, and she would not be able to make fun of him by saying that he needed a boy to carry the kettle.

He had scarcely uttered this wish, when the kettle had feet and looked like it wanted to run away. However, Lars took his time, for he wanted to think of another wish, but one did not come to him, so he and the kettle trotted off. He held tightly onto the string that he had tied to the kettle, so that it was half pulling him along behind. Because his large broad-brimmed hat grew too heavy and warm for him, he hung it on the kettle like a lid, and thus, like a proper kettle, it had both feet and a lid.

When he arrived at the castle window the young princess was still there, and when she saw the procession coming by with the kettle and the hat and Lazy Lars, she had to laugh, and she laughed so terribly hard that it almost made her sick.

""Now your kettle is walking by itself, Lazy Lars, and you don't have to carry your hat either!"" she shouted. ""All you need now is a boy to push from behind!""

""You yourself should have a boy,"" replied Lars, without thinking what he was saying, for he was tired of being teased.

Then the princess closed the window, for she no longer wanted to talk with Lazy Lars.

Lars arrived home safely with the kettle and got his noon meal. He did not give any thought to further wishes, for could not think of anything that he needed, so everything stayed as it was.

Time passed as always, but nearly a year later something strange was happening at the castle, for the princess had gotten very ill. The doctors were called in. They shook their heads and wrote prescriptions, each one longer than the others, but nothing helped even a little bit. Then the princess's mother had a private talk with her. They spoke for a long time, and the princess cried and insisted that she was innocent, but the queen did not believe her.

More time passed, and then there were no longer any doubts, for, as they say, a little barefoot boy came to the princes. The just old king nearly jumped out of his skin that such a scandal should come upon his house, and it did not make matters any better that the princess would not say anything about who the little prince's father was.

For good or for evil, more time passed, and the fatherless prince was three years old when the king said that he could no longer endure the scandal. He would find out who the child's father was, and the princess would have to marry whoever it turned out to be.

The king proclaimed across the whole realm that all men in the land, large and small, were to come together before the castle on a certain day. There they would hear the voice of the innocent child, who himself would determine who his father was.

The day arrived, and a large mass of people, fine and course, came together. Around the castle it was black with people.

On this day Lazy Lars's mother came home a little earlier than normal to prepare the noon meal, and as usual she found Lars sitting in the doorway enjoying the sunshine.

""I do say,"" she called out, ""does my Lazy Lars have nothing better to do on such a day than to sit here doing nothing?""

Lars stretched and asked why she had said that, so she told him what was going on up at the castle. Lars thought that he was just as good as anyone else, so he meandered up there himself.

When the king saw Lazy Lars approaching the castle he thought that they could surely begin now, because certainly Lars would be the last one to arrive, even though he lived closest.

They put a golden apple in the little prince's hand, and the one to whom he would give the apple, he would be the father.

The child walked slowly back and forth with the golden apple among the many people, as though he did not know what he should do with it. Finally he caught sight of Lars, who was standing at the very back of the crowd with his hands in his pockets. He walked toward Lars and reached the apple to him.

Lars, in no hurry, slowly removed his hand from his pocket and took the apple. But then there came a huge uproar, so angry were the people -- large and small, poor and rich -- at Lars's good fortune. ""Yes,"" they said, ""those who can neither read nor write have all the luck.""

Lars was nearly trampled by the envious mob, but he held the apple tightly and finally made his way to the king, the queen, and all the ministers.

When the king saw that it was Lazy Lars who had received the apple, he discovered that this final embarrassment was even worse than the first one. He took the princess, pushed her toward him, and said that he never wanted to see anything of them in his house again. If it had been a handsome gentleman then everything would have been all right, but Lazy Lars --!

The king ordered his people to put Lars and the princess and the child into a boat on the sea east of the castle. They could set their own course and travel to whatever country they might choose.

The king's order was carried out, and Lars and the princess were set adrift on the wild sea. They did not know which direction they were going. Evening came, and the princess cried pitifully. Lars, however, was lying on the bottom of the boat thinking only of himself, for this was the first time he had ever had water beneath him, and he was not up to a voyage at sea.

""What should we do?"" cried the princess. ""Tell me, Lars, what should we do?""

""Yes, what should be do?"" answered Lars. ""I don't know what we should do.""

And so they sailed on.

After a while the princess said, ""Say something, you Lazy Lars. You just lie there without saying a word.""

""What should I say then?"" mumbled Lars. ""The only thing I can say is that I wish we would soon be on land!""

He had scarcely uttered this wish when there was suddenly before them, a beautiful island with woods and houses and people and cattle.

The princess was very happy that Lars had finally opened his mouth, and she thought that everything would now be quite simple, since he was able to wish so well. She would only have to put the words into his mouth, and he would utter the wish. First of all he would have to wish that he were a normal human being and not the lazy beast that he had been up until now. Then he would have to wish for a beautiful castle with everything that went with it. He had scarcely uttered these wishes when suddenly new life came into Lars, and in the middle of the island there stood a beautiful castle, shimmering like bright gold. Then Lars had to wish for splendid clothing, carriages and horses, soldiers, and much more; and suddenly it was all at hand. -- Yes, the princess knew exactly what she wanted.

The next morning after the king had gotten up, he went, as usual, to the window to look out over the sea. He had always liked to do this. There he saw a beautiful island east of his royal castle. On it was a castle that shimmered like bright gold. Could he trust his old eyes? No. He took a pair of spectacles and looked again.

Yes, the island and the castle were still there, and that was more than the old king could comprehend. He called his people and asked if until now they had ever seen anything of this before. They too opened their eyes wide and thought that the devil himself had done this to make fools of them, for previously there had no more been an island there than there are roses on a manure pile.

To assure himself the king had a ship made ready, and with his people he sailed over to the island. When he arrived on land, a row of soldiers was there, extending from the shore up to the castle. They presented arms to the old king, which pleased him greatly.

When the old king and his people finally arrived at the castle, his daughter approached them smiling. She fell at his feet and begged him to accept the two of them into his grace, promising that they would be obedient children.

The king was amazed, and his daughter had to tell him everything that had happened. She told him how she had been punished for having lightheartedly ridiculed Lazy Lars without considering that there might be some good in him after all. But it was good that everything had happened, for now she would not want anyone but Lars. He was no longer the way he had been before. New life had come into him.

Then Lars came out, and in his beautiful clothing he looked as stately as a prince. He confirmed what the princess had said, and he also asked the king for mercy.

All's well that ends well,"" said the king. We live in a strange world, but whosoever should be together, will be together.

So everything was in order. They celebrated their wedding for many days, and they lived happily together. And when the old king died Lars became king and ruled many years with his queen. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","Robert Steele, The Russian Garland: Being Russian Folk Tales Translated from a Collection of Chapbooks Made in Moscow (London: A. M. Philpot, 1916), pp. 166-82.","In a certain village lived one time a peasant, who had three sons, two of whom were clever, but the third was a fool, and his name was Emelyan. And when the peasant had lived a long time, and was grown very old, he called his three sons to him, and said to them, ""My dear children, I feel that I have not much longer to live, so I give you the house and cattle, which you will divide among you, share and share alike. I have also given you each a hundred rubles.""

Soon after, the old man died, and the sons, when they had buried him, lived on happy and contented.

Some time afterward Emelyan's brothers took a fancy to go to the city and trade with the hundred rubles their father had left them. So they said to Emelyan, ""Hark ye, fool! We are going to the city, and will take your hundred rubles with us. And if we prosper in trade, we will buy you a red coat, red boots, and a red cap. But do you stay here at home. And when our wives, your sisters-in-law, desire you to do anything, do as they bid you.""

The fool, who had a great longing for a red coat and cap, and red boots, answered that he would do whatever his sisters-in-law bade him. So his brothers went off to the city, and the fool stayed at home with his two sisters.

One day, when the winter was come, and the cold was great, his sisters-in-law told him to go out and fetch water. But the fool remained lying on the stove, and said, ""Aye, indeed, and who then are you?""

The sisters began to scold him, and said, ""How now, fool! We are what you see. You know how cold it is, and that it is a man's business to go.""

But he said, ""I am lazy.""

""How,"" they exclaimed, ""are you lazy?"" Surely you will want to eat, and if we have no water we cannot cook. But never mind,"" they added. ""We will only tell our husbands not to give him anything when they have bought the fine red coat and all for him!""

The fool heard what they said. And, as he longed greatly to have the red coat and cap, he saw that he must go. So he got down from the stove and began to put on his shoes and stockings and to dress himself to go out. When he was dressed, he took the buckets and the ax and went down to the river hard by. And when he came to the river he began to cut a large hole in the ice. Then he drew water in the buckets, and setting them on the ice, he stood by the hole, looking into the water. And as the fool was looking, he saw a large pike swimming about. However stupid Emelyan was, he felt a wish to catch this pike. So he stole cautiously and softly to the edge of the hole, and making a sudden grasp at the pike he caught him, and pulled him out of the water. Then, putting him in his bosom, he was hastening home with him, when the pike cried out, ""Ho, fool! Why have you caught me?""

He answered, ""To take you home and get my sisters-in-law to cook you.""

""Nay, fool! Do not take me home, but throw me back into the water, and I will make a rich man of you.""

But the fool would not consent and jogged on his way home. When the pike saw that the fool was not for letting him go, he said to him, ""Hark ye, fool! Put me back in the water, and will do for you everything you do not like to do yourself. You will only have to wish, and it shall be done.""

On hearing this, the fool rejoiced beyond measure, for as he was uncommonly lazy, he thought to himself, ""If the pike does everything I have no mind to do, all will be done without my being troubled to work."" So he said to the pike, ""I will throw you back into the water if you do all you promise.""

The pike said, ""Let me go first, and then I will keep my promise.""

But the fool answered, ""Nay, nay, you must first perform your promise, and then I will let you go.""

When the pike saw that Emelyan would not put him into the water, he said, ""If you wish me to do all you desire, you must first tell me what your desire is.""

""I wish,"" said the fool, ""that my buckets should go of themselves from the river up the hill to the village without spilling any of the water.""

Then said the pike, ""Listen now, and remember the words I say to you: 'At the pike's command, go, buckets, of yourselves up the hill!'""

Then the fool repeated after him these words, and instantly, with the speed of thought, the buckets ran up the hill. When Emelyan saw this he was amazed beyond measure, and he said to the pike, ""But will it always be so?""

""Everything you desire will be done,"" replied the pike. ""But I warn you not to forget the words I have taught you.""

Then Emelyan put the pike into the water and followed his buckets home.

The neighbors were all amazed and said the one another, ""This fool makes the buckets come up of themselves from the river, and he follows them home at his leisure.""

But Emelyan took no notice of them, and went his way home. The buckets were by this time in the house, and standing in their place on the foot-bench. So the fool got up and stretched himself on the stove.

After some time his sisters-in-law said to him again, ""Emelyan, why are you lazying there? Get up and go cut wood.""

But the fool replied, ""Yes! And you -- who are you?""

""Don't you see it is now winter, and if you don't cut wood you will be frozen?""

""I am lazy,"" said the fool.

""What! You are lazy?"" cried the sisters. ""If you do not go instantly and cut wood, we will tell our husbands not to give you the red coat, or the red cap, or the fine red boots!""

The fool, who longed for the red cap, coat, and boots, saw that he must go and cut the wood. But as it was bitterly cold, and he did not like to come down from off the stove, he repeated in an undertone, as he lay, the words, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, ax, and hew the wood! And do you, logs, come of yourselves in the stove!""

Instantly the ax jumped up, ran out into the yard, and began to cut up the wood. And the logs came of themselves into the house, and laid themselves in the stove. When the sisters saw this, they wondered exceedingly at the cleverness of the fool. And, as the ax did of its own accord the work whenever Emelyan was wanted to cut wood, he lived for some time in peace and harmony with them. At length the wood was all finished, and they said to him, ""Emelyan, we have no more wood, so you must go in the forest and cut some.""

""Aye,"" said the fool, ""and you, who are you, then?""

The sisters replied, ""The wood is far off, and it is winter, and too cold for us to go.""

But the fool only said, ""I am lazy.""

""How! You are lazy?"" cried they. ""You will be frozen then. And moreover, we will take care, when our husbands come home, that they shall not give you the red coat, cap, and boots.""

As the fool longed for the clothes, he saw that he must go and cut the wood. So he got off the stove, put on his shoes and stockings, and dressed himself. And, when he was dressed, he went into the yard, dragged the sledge out of the shed, took a rope and the ax with him, and called out to his sisters-in-law, ""Open the gate.""

When the sisters saw that he was riding off without any horses, they cried, ""Why, Emelyan, you have got on the sledge without yoking the horses!""

But he answered that he wanted no horses, and bade them only open the gate. So the sisters threw open the gate, and the fool repeated the words, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, away, sledge, off to the wood!""

Instantly the sledge galloped out of the yard at such a rate that the people of the village, when they saw it, were filled with amazement at Emelyan's riding the sledge without horses, and with such speed that a pair of horses could never have drawn it at such a rate. The fool had to pass through the town on his way to the wood, and away he dashed at full speed. But the fool did not know that he should cry out, ""Make way!"" so that he did not run over anyone. But away he went, and rode over quite a lot of people. An, though they ran after him, no one was able to overtake and bring him back.

At last Emelyan, having go clear of the town, came to the wood and stopped his sledge. then he got down and said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, ax, hew wood. And you, logs, lay yourselves on the sledge and tie yourselves together.""

Scarcely had the fool uttered these words when the ax began to cut wood, the logs to lay themselves on the sledge, and the rope to tie them down. When the ax had cut wood enough, Emelyan desired it to cut him a good cudgel. And when the ax had done this, he mounted the sledge and cried, ""Up, and away! At the pike's command, and at my desire, go home, sledge!""

Away then went the sledge at the top of its speed, and when he come to the town, where he had hurt so many people, he found a crowd waiting to catch him. And, as soon as he got into the gates, they laid hold of him, dragged him off his sledge, and fell to beating him. When the fool saw how they were treating him, he said in an under voice, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, cudgel, and thrash them!""

Instantly the cudgel began to lay about it on all sides. and, when the people were all driven away, he made his escape, and come to his own village. The cudgel, having thrashed all soundly, rolled home after him. And Emelyan, as usual, when he got home, climbed up and lay upon the stove.

After he had left the town, all the people fell to talking, no so much of the number of persons he had injured, as of their amazement at his riding in a sledge without horses. And the news spread from on to another, till it reached the court and came to the ears of the king. And when the king heard it, he felt an extreme desire to see him. So he sent an officer with some soldiers to look for him. The officer instantly started, and took the road that the fool had taken. And when he came to the village where Emelyan lived, he summoned the starosta, or head-man of the village, and said to him, ""I am sent by the king to take a certain fool, and bring him before his majesty.""

The starosta at once showed him the house where Emelyan lived, and the officer went into it and asked where the fool was. He was lying on the stove, and answered, ""What is it you want with me?""

""How!"" said the officer. ""What do I want with you? Get up this instant and dress yourself. I must take you to the king.""

But Emelyan said, ""What to do?"" Whereat the officer became so enraged at the rudeness of his replies that he hit him on the cheek.

""At the pike's command, and at my desire,"" said the fool, ""up, cudgel, and thrash them!""

Instantly up sprang the cudgel and began to lay about it on all sides. So the officer was obliged to go back to the town as fast as he could. And when he came before the king, and told him how the fool had cudgeled him, the king marveled greatly, and would not believe the story.

Then the king called to him a wise man and ordered him to bring the fool by craft, if nothing else would do. So the wise man went to the village where Emelyan lived, called the starosta before him, and said, ""I am ordered by the king to take your fool. And therefore ask for persons with whom he lived.""

Then the starosta ran and fetched Emelyan's sisters-in-law. The king's messenger asked them what it was the fool liked, and they answered, ""Noble sir, if anyone entreats our fool earnestly to anything, he flatly refuses the first and second time. The third time he consents, and does what he is required, for he dislikes to be roughly treated.""

The king's messenger thereupon dismissed them and forbade them to tell Emelyan that he had summoned them before him. Then he brought raisins, baked plums, and grapes, and went to the fool. When he came into the room, he went up to the stove and said, ""Emelyan, why are you lying there?"" And with that he gave him the raisins, the baked plums, and the grapes, and said, ""Emelyan, we will go together to the king. I will take you with me.""

But the fool replied, ""I am very warm here,"" for there was nothing he liked so much as being warm.

Then the messenger began to entreat him, ""Be so good, Emelyan, do let us go! You will like the court vastly.""

""No,"" said the fool. ""I am lazy.""

But the messenger entreated him once more, ""Do come with me, there's my good fellow, and the king will give you a fine red coat and cap, and a pair of red boots.""

When the fool heard of the red coat he said, ""Go on before. I will follow you.""

The messenger pressed him no further, but went out and asked the sisters-in-law if there was any danger of the fool's deceiving him. They assured him there was not, and he went away.

Emelyan, who remained lying on the stove, then said to himself, ""How I dislike this going to the king!"" And after a minute's thought, he said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up stove, and away to the town!""

And instantly the wall of the room opened, and the stove moved out. And when it got clear of the yard, it went at such a rate that there was no overtaking it. Soon it came up with the king's messenger, and went along with him into the palace. When the king saw the fool coming, he went forth with all his court to meet him. And he was amazed beyond measure at seeing Emelyan come riding on the stove. But the fool lay still and said nothing.

Then the king asked him why he had upset so many people on his way to the wood.

""It was their own fault,"" said the fool. ""Why did they not get out of the way?""

Just at that moment the king's daughter came to the window, and Emelyan happening suddenly to look up, and seeing how handsome she was, said in a whisper, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, let this lovely maiden fall in love with me!""

And scarcely had he spoken the words when the king's daughter in love with him. Then said the fool, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, stove, and away home!""

Immediately the stove left the palace, went through the town, returned home, and set itself in its old place. And Emelyan lived there for some time comfortably and happy.

But it was very different in the town. For, at the word of Emelyan, the king's daughter had fallen in love, and she began to implore her father to give her the fool for her husband. The king was in a great rage, both with her and with fool, but he knew not how to catch him. Then his minister proposed that the same officer, as a punishment for not succeeding the first time, should be sent again to take Emelyan.

This advice pleased the king, and he summoned the officer to his presence, and said, ""Hark ye, friend! I sent you before for the fool, and you came back without him. To punish you, I now send you for him a second time. If you bring him, you shall be rewarded. If you return without him, you shall be punished.""

When the officer heard this, he left the king and lost no time to going in quest of the fool. And on coming to the village he called for the starosta and said to him, ""Here is money for you. Buy everything necessary for a good dinner tomorrow. Invite Emelyan, and when he comes, make him drink until he falls asleep.""

The starosta, knowing that the officer came from the king, was obliged to obey him, so he bought all that was required and invited the fool. And Emelyan said he would come, whereat the officer was greatly rejoiced. So next day the fool came to dinner, and the starosta plied him so well with drink that he fell fast asleep. When the officer saw this, he ordered the kibitka (or carriage) to be brought, and putting the fool into it, they drove off to the town, and went straight to the palace.

As soon as the king heard that they were come, he ordered a large cask to be provided without delay, and to be bound with strong iron hoops. When the cask was brought to the king, and he saw that everything was ready as he desired, he commanded his daughter and the fool to be put in it, and the cask to be well pitched. And when this was done, the cask was thrown into the sea, and left to the mercy of the waves. Then the king returned to his palace, and the cask floated along upon the sea.

All this time the fool was fast asleep. When he awoke, and saw that it was quite dark, he said to himself, ""Where am I?"" for he thought he was alone.

But the princess said, ""You are in a cask, Emelyan! And I am shut up with you in it.""

""But who are you?"" said the fool.

""I am the king's daughter,"" replied she. And she told him why she had been shut up there with him.

Then she besought him to free himself and her out of the cask, but the fool said, ""Nay, I am warm enough here.""

""But grant me at least the favor,"" said the princess. ""Have pity on my tears, and deliver me out of this cask.""

""Why so?"" said Emelyan. ""I am lazy.""

Then the princess began to entreat him still more urgently, until the fool was at last moved by her tears and entreaties, and said, ""Well, I will do this for you."" Then he said softly, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, cast us, O sea, upon the shore, where we may dwell on dry land. But let it be near our own country. And, cask, fall to pieces on the shore.""

Scarcely had the fool uttered these words when the waves began to roll, and the cask was thrown on a dry place, and fell to pieces of itself. So Emelyan got up and went with the princess round about the spot where they were cast. And the fool saw that they were on a fine island, where there was an abundance of trees, with all kinds of fruit upon them.

When the princess saw this, she was greatly rejoiced and said, ""But, Emelyan, where shall we live? There is not even a nook here.""

""You want too much,"" said the fool.

""Grant me one favor,"" replied the princess. ""Let there be at least a little cottage in which we may shelter ourselves from the rain,"" for the princess knew that he could do everything that he wished.

But the fool said, ""I am lazy.""

Nevertheless, she went on entreating him, until at last Emelyan was obliged to do as she desired. Then he stepped aside and said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, let me have in the middle of this island a finer castle than the king's, and let a crystal bridge lead from my castle to the royal palace. And let there be attendants of all conditions in the court!""

Hardly were the words spoken, when there appeared a splendid castle, with a crystal bridge. The fool went with the princess into the castle and beheld the apartments all magnificently furnished, and a number of persons, footmen and all kinds of officers, who waited for the fool's commands.

When he saw that all these men were like men, and the he alone was ugly and stupid, he wished to be better, so he said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, away, let me become a youth without an equal, and extremely wise!"" And hardly had he spoken, when he became so handsome and so wise that all were amazed.

Emelyan now sent on of his servants to the king to invite him and all his court. So the servant went along the crystal bridge which the fool had made, and when he came to the court, the ministers brought him before the king, and Emelyan's messenger said, ""Please, your majesty, I am sent by my master to invite you do dinner.""

The king asked him who his master was, but he answered, ""Please, your majesty, I can tell you nothing about my master (for the fool had ordered him not to tell who he was), but if you come to dine with him, he will inform you himself.""

The king, being curious to know who had sent to invite him, told the messenger that he would go without fail. The servant went away, and when he got home, the king and his court set out along the crystal bridge to go and visit the fool. And, when they arrived at the castle, Emelyan came forth to meet the king, took him by his white hands, kissed him on his sugared lips, led him into his castle, and seated him at the oaken tables covered with fine diaper tablecloths, and spread with sugar-meats and honey-drinks. The king and him ministers ate and drank and made merry.

When they rose from the table and retired, the fool said to the king, ""Does your majesty know who I am?""

As Emelyan was now dressed in fine clothes, and was very handsome, it was not possible to recognize him, so the king replied that he did not know him.

Then the fool said, ""Does not your majesty recollect how a fool came riding on a stove to your court, and how you fastened him up in a pitched cask with your daughter, and cast them into the sea? Know me now. I am that Emelyan.""

When the king saw him thus in his presence he was greatly terrified and knew not what to do. But the fool went to the princess and led her out to him. And the king, on seeing his daughter, was greatly rejoiced, and said, ""I have been very unjust to you, and so I gladly give you my daughter to wife.""

The fool humbly thanked the king. And when Emelyan had prepared everything for the wedding, it was celebrated with great magnificence, and the following day the fool gave a feast to the ministers and all the people. When the festivities were at an end, the king wanted to give up his kingdom to his son-in-law, but Emelyan did not wish to have the crown. So the king went back to his kingdom, and the fool remained in the castle and lived happily.",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
675,Halfman,Greece,"Translated from the German by D. L. Ashliman. © 2011.  The episode of the spoon planted in the king's boot is reminiscent of the Bible story of Joseph, who had a silver goblet planted in his brother Benjamin's pack. (Genesis, chapters 44-45) ","""Der halbe Mensch,"" Johann Georg von Hahn, Griechische und albanesische Märchen, vol. 1 (Leipzig: Wilhelm Engelmann, 1864), pp. 102-109. ","Once upon a time there was a woman who had no children. She was so unhappy about this that one day she prayed to God, ""Dear God, give me a child, even if it were only half a child.""

Then God gave her a boy with half a head, half a nose, half a mouth, half a body, one hand and one foot. He was so misshapen that the mother always kept him at home and did not send him out to work.

One day, however, he became bored, and he said to his mother, ""Mother, I do not want to stay at home any longer. Give me an ax and a mule. I want to go out into the woods to fetch wood.""

His mother replied, ""How can you chop wood, dear child? You are only half a person.""

Nonetheless, he begged so long that finally his mother gave him an ax and a mule. He took these into the woods. He chopped wood and brought it back home. He did this work so well that his mother allowed him to continue.

One day when he was fetching wood he passed by the princess's castle. When she saw him with one foot and one arm sitting on the mule she laughed out loud and called to her maidservants, ""Come and see the half man!""

This embarrassed Halfman so much that he dropped his ax. He thought for a moment, then asked himself, ""Shall I get off and pick it up, or shall I not?""

In the end he did not get off, but instead left the ax lying there rode on.

The princess said to the maidservants, ""Just look at Halfman! He drops his ax and doesn't even get off to pick it up!""

This embarrassed Halfman even more, and he dropped his rope. Once again he thought for a moment, then said to himself, ""Shall I get off and pick up the rope, or shall I not?""

In the end he rode off, leaving the rope lying there.

With that the princess called to her maidservants, ""Just look at Halfman! He drops his ax and his rope and doesn't even get off to pick them up!""

Halfman rode on to the place where he was gathering wood, but arriving there he said to himself, ""How can I chop wood, and how can I tie it together?""

A lake was there, and while he stood there looking into the water he saw a fish swim up to the bank. He quickly threw his ragged coat onto it and caught it.

The fish begged for its life, saying, ""Let me loose, Halfman, and I will teach you a charm to make all your wishes come true.""

Then Halfman said, ""If what you say is true, then load my mule with wood.""

The fish said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, the mule shall be loaded with wood!""

And behold, before he finished speaking this charm, the mule was loaded with wood.

Seeing this, Halfman said to the fish, ""If you will teach me the charm I will set you free.""

The fish said, ""Whenever you want something to happen, just say, 'By the first word of God and the second word of the fish,' and whatever you wish for shall be granted.""

With that Halfman set the fish free, took his loaded mule, and walked off toward the princess's castle.

When the princess saw him she called to her maidservants, ""Come quickly and see how Halfman has loaded his mule without an ax or a rope."" Then they all laughed until they could laugh no more.

This made Halfman angry, and he said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let the princess become pregnant!""

When her time came she bore a child, and no one knew who the father was.

Her father summoned her and asked her who the father was, but she answered repeatedly, ""I have not even spoken with a man. I do not know where the child came from.""

When the child was older the king summoned everyone to his capitol. After they had all gathered there he gave the child an apple and said, ""Go forth and give this to your father.""

While the child was walking about and playing with the apple, he dropped it onto the ground, and it rolled away from him, finally coming to a rest in the corner where Halfman was standing. The child bent over to pick up the apple, then lifting his head he saw Halfman and said, ""Here Papa! Take the apple!""

Hearing this, the people took hold of Halfman and brought him before the king.

The king said, ""Because it was Halfman who did this, we must kill them all: him, the princess, and the child.""

However, some of his councilors said to him, ""What you say is unjust. The princess is your daughter, and you cannot shed your own blood. It would be better to make an iron cask, put the princess, Halfman, and the child inside, and throw them into the sea. Give them only a bunch of figs for the child, so that it will not die too quickly.""

This advice pleased the king. Thus he had the cask made, the three placed inside, and thrown into the sea.

Now seated inside the cask, the princess said to Halfman, ""I have never seen you before. How is it that we are now here together?""

""Give me a fig,"" replied Halfman, ""and I will tell you about it.""

The princess gave him a fig from those that they had brought along for the child. After he had eaten it, Halfman said, ""Don't you remember how you laughed at me when I passed by the castle, and I dropped my ax and my rope?""

""Yes, I remember that,"" replied the princess.

""Now I know a charm, and when I repeat it my every wish is fulfilled. At that time I wished that you should become pregnant, and that is why you became pregnant.""

To that the princess said, ""If you know such a charm that fulfills your every wish, then wish us out of this cask and onto dry land.""

Halfman replied, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so.""

So the princess gave him a fig, and he secretly said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, may this cask drift onto dry land and open itself so that we can get out.""

And immediately the cask hit dry land, opened itself, and they all got out.

It was raining outside, and the princess said, ""Speak your charm so that we can find shelter and not get wet.""

Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so.""

So the princess gave him a fig, and he said to himself, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let there be shelter here!""

Suddenly such was the case, and they got under it.

The princess said to Halfman, ""Until now you have done very well! Now speak your charm and give us a large castle whose stones and timbers and furnishings all can speak.""

Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so.""

So the princess gave him a fig, and he said to himself, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let there be castle whose stones and timbers and furnishings all can speak!""

Suddenly such a castle was there, and everything connected to it could speak, and they went inside to live there, and Halfman brought forth everything that they needed and whatever the princess wished for herself.

One day the king was out hunting, and he saw in the distance a castle that he had never seen before. He sent two of his servants thither, saying to them, ""Take these partridges, go to that castle and broil them there, and see what kind of castle it is, for I have often been here hunting, but I have never before noticed it.""

The servants, thus commanded by the king, took the partridges and went to the castle. When they approached the outer door, it said to them, ""What do you want here?""

They said, ""The king sent us here to broil these two partridges.""

The door replied, ""Stay here. First I must ask the lady of the house.""

Then the outer door asked the first inner door, which in turn asked the second one, which in turn asked the third one, and so on, door to door, until the question reached the lady of the house. She ordered that the strangers be admitted, and suddenly all the doors opened by themselves, allowing the servants to come inside. They were greatly amazed when even the stones and the timbers welcomed them.

Entering the kitchen one of them said, ""Where can we find some wood?""

The pieces of wood called out, ""Here we are!""

Then they said to one another, ""We have no salt and no butter,"" to which the salt and butter called out, ""Here we are!""

After they had prepared the partridges, put them on the spit, and placed them next to the fire, they wanted to look around outside the kitchen to see if there were other things in the castle that could speak. However, they found so many such things and stayed away from the kitchen so long that the partridges had burned to charcoal when they finally thought about them and ran back to the kitchen.

They did not know how they could excuse themselves to the king for having burned up his partridges. Finally they decided to go directly back to him and tell him what they had seen.

The king did not believe them, and he sent other servants thither. They experienced the same things that the first ones had, and when the king heard them say the same thing, he decided that he would go there himself to see and hear with his own eyes and ears.

When he arrived at the outside door, it said to him, ""Welcome, your majesty!""

When he went inside, all the stones and timbers called out the same welcome to him, and the king was amazed that here wood and stones could talk. Hearing that the king himself had arrived, the princess went to him to receive him. She led him into her splendid rooms, but did not tell him who she was. The king wondered about her correct manners and her elegant speech.

Meanwhile the servants in the kitchen wanted to broil the partridges that the king had brought, and the same thing happened to them that had happened to the others. Amazed at all they saw and heard, they let the partridges burn to charcoal.

When the king learned of this he became extremely angry, for he was very hungry and now had nothing to eat.

The princess said, ""I beg of your majesty to do us the favor of dining in our humble house.""

The king accepted, and she left him in order to look for Halfman, who had sneaked away from the king. Finding him, she said, ""I invited the king to eat with us. Now speak a charm to provide a splendid feast with the appropriate servants, musicians, dancers, and everything else to go with it.""

To this Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will speak the charm.""

So the princess gave him a fig, and after he had eaten it he spoke the charm, asking for everything that the princess wanted, and suddenly a feast appeared, with everything that went with it.

As soon as the king and his servants were seated at the table the musicians began to play, and they played so beautifully that the king was amazed. He said, ""I am a king, but I have never had such music in my castle.""

Then the dancers began to dance, and they danced so beautifully that the king said to the princess, ""I am a king, but I have never had such dancers in my castle. Tell me how you came to them.""

The princess replied, ""My father left them to me as an inheritance.""

Then the princess went to Halfman and said, ""You must speak a charm that will put a spoon into one of the king's boots.""

Halfman replied, ""Give me a fig and I will do so.""

The princess gave him a fig, and he spoke the charm, granting the princess's wish.

When the king was about to depart, the princes said, ""Wait a moment. I believe that something is missing.""

This disturbed the king, who said, ""No, that is not possible. We are not such people!""

But the princess would not be dissuaded. She called out, ""Are you platters all there?""

""Yes!""

""Are you plates all there?""

""Yes!""

""Are you spoons all there?""

With that the spoon inside the king's boot called out, ""I am stuck in the king's boot!""

Now the princess began to scold the king, saying, ""I invited you into my house, prepared a feast for you, and granted you every honor, and now your are stealing one of my spoons! Are you not ashamed of yourself?""

The king said, ""This is not possible! Someone put the spoon into my boot! You are doing me a severe injustice!""

To that the princess said, ""You also did such an injustice to me when you put Halfman and me into a cask, although I had done nothing wrong.""

The king stood there a long time, speechless with amazement. Then the princess brought Halfman to him, and Halfman explained everything that had happened.

The king was amazed at this tale. He took his daughter back home with him and married her to one of his noblemen. He appointed Halfman to be his chief bodyguard and gave him his most beautiful slave girl for a wife. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","One day Juvadi went to gather twigs, and he found an oak branch with acorns on it. He picked it up and carefully carried it in his arms. As he approached town he straddled it like a horse and thus pulled it further along.

The little princess was standing at one of the king's windows, and she began to laugh out loud.

Juvadi saw her and said, ""May you get pregnant by me!""

She soon became pregnant, and nine months later gave birth to a girl. The king was so angry about this that he called together his council and said, ""Advise me what I should do to the person who has brought this shame upon me. I cannot believe what people are saying.""

The councilors said, ""Bring together all the men in the kingdom, and then we shall see whom the child calls Papa.""

So the king summoned all the men to his house. His barons, princes, knights, citizens, and peasants all came, but the child did not call any of them Papa. The only man left was Juvadi, who did not come. Then the king forced him to come, and the child had scarcely seen him when she called him Papa.

Once again the king called together his council and asked, ""What should the punishment be for those who caused this shame?""

They answered, ""Let us put them into a cask and roll it over a cliff.""

So they had a cask made and locked the princess, her daughter, and Juvadi inside, then rolled it to a cliff to push it over.

As it rolled along, Juvadi said, ""Let me out! Let me out! I'll give you figs and raisins.""

So saying, he threw handfuls of figs and raisins out of the cask. The cask stopped rolling at a level spot. Juvadi broke open the cask, and they all got out.

A witch was in the vicinity, and she laughed so hard that a swelling on her neck disappeared. She was very happy about this, and she said to Juvadi, ""What is your wish? I can do everything, and will do something good for you.""

Juvadi answered, ""Make a house for me, for we have no place to live.""

The witch picked up a stick and made a circle with it, saying, ""Here shall be a palace, with all the comforts of the world.""

Suddenly a beautiful palace was there, and Juvadi happily went inside with the princess and their daughter.

The princess then said to Juvadi, ""Now you have to have an enchantment that will drive out your stupidity."" ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
675,Peter the Fool,Giovanni Francesco Straparola,"First published as Le piacevoli notti, 2 vols., 1550/1553.  Edited by D. L. Ashliman. © 2011.  The episode of the golden apple planted in the father's robe is reminiscent of the Bible story of Joseph, who had a silver goblet planted in his brother Benjamin's pack. (Genesis, chapters 44-45) ","Giovanni Francesco Straparola, The Facetious Nights of Straparola: The Italian Novelists, translated into English by W. G. Waters; vol. 1 (London: Privately printed for members of the Society of Bibliophiles, 1901), night 3, tale 1, pp. 242-59. ","There is proof enough, dear ladies, both in the chronicles of the past and in the doings of our own day, that a fool, whether by lucky accident or by sheer force of blundering, may sometimes score a success where a wise man might fail. Therefore, it has come into my mind to tell you the story of one of these fools, who, through the issue of a very foolish deed, got for his wife the daughter of a king and became a wise man himself into the bargain.

In the Ligurian Sea there is an island called Capraia, which, at the time I am describing, was ruled by King Luciano. Amongst his subjects was a poor widow named Isotta, who lived with her only son Peter, a fisher lad. But from Peter's fishing she would scarce have kept body and soul together, for he was a poor silly creature known to all the neighbors as Peter the Fool.

Though he went fishing every day he never caught anything, but in spite of his ill success he would always come up from his boat shouting and bellowing so that all the town might hear him, ""Mother, mother, bring out your tubs and your buckets and your pails. Bring them out all, great and small, for Peter has caught a boatful of fish.""

The poor woman soon got to know the value of Peter's bragging, but in spite of this she always prepared the vessels, only to find herself jeered at by the silly youth, who, as soon as he came near, would thrust out his long tongue in ridicule, and otherwise mock at her.

Now it chanced that the widow's cottage stood just opposite to the palace of King Luciano, who had only one child, a pretty graceful girl about ten years old, Luciana by name.

She, it happened, was looking out of the window of the palace one day when Peter came back from fishing, crying out to his mother to bring out her tubs and her buckets and her pails to hold the fish with which he was laden, and so much was she diverted at the silly antics of the fool, that it seemed likely she would die with laughing.

Peter, when he saw that he was made sport of, grew very angry, and threw some ugly words at her, but the more he raged the more she -- after the manner of willful children -- laughed and made mock at him.

Peter, however, went on with his fishing day after day, and played the same trick on his mother every evening on his return. But at last fortune favored him, and he caught a fine tunny, very big and fat.

Overjoyed at his good luck, he began to shout and cry out over and over again, ""Mother and I will have a good supper tonight,"" when, to his amazement, he heard the tunny which he had just caught begin to speak, ""Ah! My dear brother, I pray you of your courtesy to give me my life. When once you have eaten me, what farther benefit do you think you will get from me? But if you will let me live there is no telling what service I may not render you.""

But Peter, whose thoughts just then were set only on his supper, hoisted the fish on his shoulders and set off homewards. But the tunny still kept on beseeching his captor to spare his life, promising him first as many fish as he could want, and finally to do him any favor he might demand. Peter was not hardhearted, and, though a fool, fancied he might profit by sparing the fish, so he listened to the tunny's petition and threw him back into the sea.

The fish, sensible of Peter's kindness, and not wishing to seem ungrateful, told Peter to get into his boat again and tilt it over so that the water could run in. This advice Peter at once followed, and, having leant over on one side, he let the boat be half filled with water, which brought in with it such a huge quantity of fish that the boat was in danger of sinking.

Peter was well nigh beside himself with joy when be saw what had happened, and, when he had taken as many fish as he could carry, he betook himself homewards, crying out, as was his wont, when he drew near to the cottage, ""Mother, mother, bring out your tubs and your buckets and your pails. Bring out them all, great and small, for Peter has caught a boatful of fish.""

At first poor Isotta, thinking that he was only playing his old fool's game, took no heed. But at last, hearing him cry out louder than ever, and fearing that he might commit some greater folly if he should not find the vessels prepared as usual, got them all ready. What was her surprise to see her simpleton of a son at last coming back with a brave spoil!

The Princess Luciana was at the palace window, and hearing Peter bellowing louder than ever, she laughed louder than ever, so that Peter was almost mad with rage, and having left his fish, he rushed back to the seashore, and called aloud on the tunny to come and help him.

The fish, hearing Peter's voice, came to the marge of the shore, and putting his nose up out of the waves, asked what service was required of him.

""What service!"" cried Peter. ""Why I would that Luciana, that saucy minx, the daughter of our king, should find herself with child at once.""

What followed was a proof that the tunny had. not made an empty promise to Peter, for before many days had passed the figure of the young girl, who was not twelve years old, began to show signs of maternity.

Her mother, when she marked this, fell into great trouble, but she could not believe that a child of eleven could be pregnant, and rather set down the swelling to the working of an incurable disease; so she brought Luciana to be examined by some women expert in such cases, and these, as soon as they saw the girl, declared that she was certainly with child.

The queen, overwhelmed by this terrible news, told it also to the king, and he, when he heard it, cried aloud for death rather than such ignominy. Strict inquisition was made to discover who could have violated the child, but nothing was found out; so Luciano, to hide her dire disgrace, determined to have his daughter secretly killed.

The queen, on hearing this, begged her husband to spare the unfortunate Luciana till the child should be born, and then do with her what he would. The king, moved with compassion for his only daughter, gave way so far; and in due time Luciana was delivered of a boy so fine and beautiful that the king could no longer harbor the thought of putting them away, but, on the other hand, gave order to the queen that the boy should be well tended till he was a year old.

When this time was completed the child had become beautiful beyond compare, and then it came into the king's mind that he would again make a trial to find out who the father might be. He issued a proclamation that every man in the city who had passed fourteen years should, under pain of losing his head, present himself at the palace bearing in his hand some fruit or flower which might attract the child's attention. On the appointed day, in obedience to the proclamation, all those summoned came to the palace, bearing, this man one thing and that man another, and, having passed before the king, sat down according to their rank.

Now it happened that a certain young man as he was betaking himself to the palace met Peter, and said to him, ""Peter, why are you not going to the palace like all the others to obey the order of the king?""

""What should I do in such a crowd as that?"" said Peter. ""Cannot you see I am a poor naked fellow, and have hardly a rag to my back, and yet you ask me to push myself in amongst all those gentlemen and courtiers? No.""

Then the young man, laughing at him, said, ""Come with me, and I will give you a coat. Who knows whether the child may not turn out to be yours?""

In the end Peter let himself be persuaded to go to the young man's house, and having put on a decent coat, they went together to the palace. But when they arrived there Peter's heart again failed him, and he hid himself behind a door. By this time all the men had presented themselves to the king, and were seated in the hall.

Then Luciano commanded the nurse to bring in the child, thinking that if the father should be there the sense of paternity would make him give some sign. As the nurse carried the child down the hall everyone, as he passed, began to caress him and to give him, this one a fruit and that one a flower; but the infant, with a wave of his hand, refused them all.

When the nurse passed by the entrance door the child began to laugh and crow, and threw himself forward so lustily that he almost jumped out of the woman's arms, but she, not knowing that anyone was there, walked on down the hall. When she came back to the same place the child was more delighted than ever, laughing and pointing with his finger to the door; so that the king, who had already noticed the child's actions, called to the nurse and asked her who was behind the door.

The nurse, being somewhat confused, said that surely some beggar must be hidden there. By the king's command Peter was at once haled forth, and everybody recognized the town fool. But the child, who was close to him, stretched out his arms and clasped Peter round the neck and kissed him lovingly. The king, recognizing the sign, was stricken to the heart with grief, and having discharged the assembly, commanded that Peter and Luciana and the child should be put to death forthwith.

The queen, though assenting to this doom, was fearful lest the public execution of the victims might draw down upon the king the anger of the people; so she persuaded him to have made a huge cask into which the three might be put and cast into the sea to drift at random. Then, at least, no one might witness their dying agony.

This the king agreed to; and when the cask was made, the condemned ones were put therein, with a basket of bread and a flask of wine, and a drum of figs for the child, and thrust out into the rough sea, with the expectation that the waves would soon dash it to pieces against the rocks. But this was not to be their fate.

Peter's poor old mother, when she heard of her son's misfortune, died of grief in a few days; and the unhappy Luciana, tossed about by the cruel waves, and seeing neither sun nor moon, would have welcomed a similar fate. The child, since she had no milk to give it, had to be soothed to sleep with now and then a fig. But Peter seemed to care for nothing, and ate the bread and drank the wine steadily, laughing the while.

""Alas! alas!"" cried Luciana in despair. ""You care nothing for this evil which you have brought upon me, a poor innocent girl. You eat and drink and laugh without a thought of the danger around us.

""Why,"" replied Peter, ""this misfortune is more your own fault than mine. If you had not mocked me so, it would never have happened. But do not lose heart. Our troubles will soon be over.""

""I believe that,"" cried Luciana, ""for the cask will soon be split on a rock, and then we must all be drowned.""

""No, no,"" said Peter."" Calm yourself. I have a secret, and were you to know what it is, you would be vastly surprised and vastly delighted too, I believe.""

""What secret can you know,"" said Luciana, ""which will avail us in such danger as this?""

""I will soon tell you,"" Peter replied. ""I have a faithful servant, a great fish, who will do me any service I ask of him, and there is nothing he cannot do. I may as well tell you it was through his working that you became with child.""

""That I cannot believe,"" said Luciana. And what may this fish of yours be called?""

""His name is Signor Tunny,"" replied Peter.

""Then,"" said Luciana, ""to put your fish to the test, I will ask you to transfer to me the power you exercise over him, and to command him to do my bidding instead of yours.""

""Be it as you will,"" said Peter; and without more ado he called the tunny, who at once rose up near the cask, whereupon Peter commanded him to do everything that Luciana might require of him.

She at once exercised her power over the fish by ordering him to make the waves cast the cask ashore in a fair safe cleft in the rocks on an island, a short sail from her father's kingdom.

As soon as the fish had worked her will so far, she laid other and much harder tasks upon him. One was to change Peter from the ugly fool that he was into a clever, handsome gallant. Another was to have built for her forthwith a rich and sumptuous palace with lofty halls and chambers and girt with carven terraces. Within the court there was to be laid out a beautiful garden, full of trees which should bear, instead of fruit, pearls and precious stones, and in the midst of it two fountains, one of the freshest water and the other of the finest wine. All these wonders were wrought by the fish almost as soon as Luciana had spoken.

Now all this time the king and the queen were in deep misery in thinking of the cruel death they had contrived for Luciana and her child, how they had given their own flesh and blood to be eaten by the fishes. Therefore, to find some solace in their woe, they determined to go to Jerusalem and to visit the Holy Land. So they ordered a ship to be put in order for them, and furnished with all things suited to their state.

They set sail with a favoring wind, and before they had gone a hundred miles they came in sight of an island upon which they could see a stately palace, built a little above the level of the sea. Seeing that this palace was so fair and sumptuous, and standing, moreover, within Luciano's kingdom, they were seized with a longing to view it more closely. So, having put into a haven, they landed on the island.

Before they had come to the palace Luciana and Peter saw and recognized them, and, having gone forth to meet them, greeted them with a cordial welcome, but the king and queen did not know their hosts for the great change which had come over them.

The guests were taken first into the palace, which they examined in every part, praising loudly its great beauty, and then they were led by a secret staircase into the garden, the splendor of which pleased them so amazingly that they swore they had never at any time before looked upon a place so delightful.

In the center of this garden there stood a noble tree, which bore on one of its branches three golden apples. These the keeper of the garden was charged to guard jealously against robbers, and now, by some secret working which I cannot unravel, the finest of these apples was transported into the folds of the king's robe about his bosom, and there hidden.

Luciano and the queen were about to take their leave when the keeper approached and said to Luciana, ""Madam, the most beautiful of the three golden apples is missing, and I can find no trace of the thief.""

Luciana forthwith gave orders that the whole household should be searched, one by one, for such a loss as this was no light matter. The keeper, after he had searched thoroughly everyone, came back and told Luciana that the apple was nowhere to be found.

At these words Luciana fell into great confusion, and, turning to the king, said, ""Your majesty must not be wroth with me if I ask that even you allow yourself to be searched, for I prize the golden apple that is lost almost as highly as my life.""

The king, unsuspicious of any trick, and sure of his innocence, straightway loosened his robe, and lo! the golden apple fell from it to the ground.

The king stood as one dazed, ignorant as to how the golden apple could have come into his robe, and Luciana spoke, ""Sire, we have welcomed you to our house with all the worship fitting to your rank, and now, as a recompense, you would privily rob our garden of its finest fruit. Meseems you have proved yourself very ungrateful.""

The king, in his innocence, attempted to prove to her that he could not have taken the apple, and Luciana, seeing his confusion, knew that the time had come for her to speak, and reveal herself to her father.

""My lord,"" she said, with the tears in her eyes, ""I am Luciana, your hapless daughter, whom you sentenced to a cruel death along with my child and Peter the fisher boy. Though I bore a child, I was never unchaste. Here is the boy, and here is he whom men were wont to call Peter the Fool. You wonder at this change. It has all been brought about by the power of a marvelous fish whose life Peter spared when he had caught it in his net. By this power Peter has been turned into the wisest of men, and the palace you see has been built. In the same way I became pregnant without knowledge of a man, and the golden apple was conveyed into the folds of your robe. I am as innocent of unchastity as you are of theft.""

When the king heard these words his eyes were opened, and he knew his child. Then, weeping with joy, they embraced each other, and all were glad and happy. After spending a few days on the island, they all embarked and returned together to Capraia, where with sumptuous feastings and rejoicings Peter was duly married to Luciana, and lived with her in great honor and contentment, until Luciano died, and then he became king in his stead.

675,Peruonto,Giambattista Basile,Translation revised by D. L. Ashliman. © 2011.,"Giambattista Basile, Il Pentamerone; or, The Tale of Tales, translated by Richard Burton, vol. 1 (London: Henry and Company, 1893), pp. 30-39. ","A good deed is never lost: whoever sows the seed of kindness meets with due reward, and whoever sows the seed of love gathers love in return. The favor which is shown to a grateful heart is never barren, and gratitude gives birth to gifts. Instances of these sayings occur continually in the deeds of mankind: and you will meet with an example of it in the tale that I am about to relate to you.

A countrywoman of Casoria, by the name of Ceccarella, had a son named Peruonto, who was the silliest body and the ugliest lump of flesh that nature had ever created; so that the unhappy mother always felt sad at heart, and cursed the day and the hour upon which she had given birth to this good-for-nothing, who was not worth a dog's hide. The unfortunate woman could cry out as much as she liked, but the ass never stirred to do her the lightest service.

At last, after screaming herself hoarse, and assailing him with all the epithets she could think of, she induced him to go to the forest and gather a fagot of wood, saying, ""It is nearly time that we should have something to eat. Run for this wood, that I may get ready somewhat: and forget not yourself on the way, but come back at once, that I may cook the needful so as to keep the life in us.""

Peruonto departed, and fared on like a monk among his brethren in a procession. Away he went, stepping as one treading down eggs, with the gait of a jackdaw, counting his paces as he went. At last he reached a certain part of the forest through which ran a streamlet, and nearby he saw three young girls lying on the grass, with a stone for a pillow, fast asleep, with the sun pouring its rays straight upon them. When Peruonto saw them, like a fountain amid a roaring fire, he took compassion upon them; and with the ax which he carried to cut the wood he severed some branches from the trees, and built a kind of arbor over them. Whilst he was busy so doing the young girls awoke (they were the daughters of a fairy), and perceiving the kindness and goodness of heart of Peruonto, in gratitude they gave him a charm, by which he might possess whatever he knew how to ask for.

Peruonto, having performed this action, continued faring towards the forest, where he cut down a fagot of wood so large that it would require a cart to carry it.

Seeing that it would be impossible for him to lift it, he sat upon it, saying, ""Would it not be a fine thing if only this fagot would carry me home?""

And behold, the fagot began to trot like a Besignano horse, and arriving before the king's palace, it began to wheel round, and prance, and curvet, so that Peruonto cried out aloud, enough to deafen all hearers. The young ladies who attended the king's daughter, whose name was Vastolla, happening to look out of the window and behold this marvel, hastened to call the princess, who, glancing out and observing the tricks played by the fagot, laughed until she fell backwards, which thing was unusual, and the young ladies were astonished at the sight, as the Lady Vastolla was by nature so melancholy that they never remembered to have seen her smile.

Peruonto lifted his head, and perceiving that they were mocking him, said, ""O Vastolla, may you be with child by me!"" and thus saying, tightened his heels on the fagot, which at once moved away, and in an instant arrived home with a train of screaming children behind; and if his mother had not quickly shut the door, they would have slain him with stones.

In the meantime Vastolla, after a feeling of uneasiness, and unrest, and the delay of her monthly period, perceived that she was with child, and hid as long as possible her plight, until she was round as a cask.

The king, discovering her condition, was exceedingly angry, and fumed, and swore terrible oaths, and convened a meeting of the council, and thus spoke to them: '""You all know that the moon of my honor is wearing horns, and you all know that my daughter has furnished matter of which to write chronicles, or, even better, to chronicle my shame. You all know that to adorn my brow she has filled her belly; therefore tell me, advise me what I had better do. Methinks I had rather have her slain than have her give birth to a bastard race. I have a mind to let her feel rather the agonies of death than the labor of childbed. I have a mind to let her depart this world ere she bring bad seed into it.""

The ministers and advisers, who had made use of more oil than vinegar, answered him, saying, ""Truly she deserves a great punishment, and of the horns which she forces on your brow should the handle be made of the knife that shall slay her; but if we slay her now that she is with child, the villain who has been the principal cause of your disgust, and who has dressed you with horns right and left will escape unhurt. Let us await, therefore, until it comes to port, and then we are likely to know the root of this dishonor; and afterwards we will think and resolve, with a grain of salt, which course we should best follow.""

The king was pleased with this advice, perceiving in it sound sense, and therefore held his hand, and said, ""Let us await the issue of events.""

As heaven willed, the time came, and with little labor, at the first sound of the midwife's voice, and the first squeeze of the body, out sprang two male children like two golden apples.

The king, who was full of wrath, sent for his ministers and counselors, and said to them, ""My daughter has been brought to bed, and the time has come for her to die.""

The old sages answered (and all to gain time upon time), ""No, we will wait until the children get older, so as to be able by their favor to recognize their father.""

The king, not desiring his counselors to think him unjust, shrugged his shoulders and took it quietly, and patiently waited until the children were seven years of age, at which time he again sent for his counselors, and asked them for their advice.

One of them said, ""As you have not been able to know from your daughter who was the false coiner that altered the crown from your image, it is time that we seek to obliterate the stain. Command that a great banquet should be prepared, and ask all the grandees and noblemen of the city, and let us be watchful, and seek with our own eyes him to whom the children incline most by the inclination of nature, for that one without fail will be the father, and we will at once get hold of him like goat's excrement.""

The king was pleased with this advice. He gave orders for the banquet, invited all folk of any consequence, and after they had eaten their fill he asked them to stand in line and pass before the children, but they took as much notice of them as did Alexander's steed of the rabbits, so that the king became enraged and bit his lips with anger, and although he was not wanting in shoes, because of the tightness of those he was compelled to wear he stamped the ground with the excess of pain.

His advisers said to him, ""Softly, your majesty! Take heart. We will give another banquet in a short while, no more inviting the noblest of the land, but instead folk of the lower class, as women often attach themselves to the worst: and perchance we will meet with the seed of your wrath amid cutlers, comb-sellers, and other merchants of small wares, as we have not met with him among the noble and well-born.""

The king was pleased with this advice, and commanded the second banquet to be prepared, whereto came, by invited by a summons, all folk from Chiaja, all the rogues, all adventurers and fortune-hunters, all quick-witted, all ruffians, and villains, and apron-wights that were to be found in the city, who, taking seat like unto noblemen at a long table spread with rich abundance, began straightway to stuff themselves.

Now it so happened that Ceccarella, having heard the ban which invited folk to this banquet, began to urge Peruonto to go to it also, and so much did she say and do that at last she prevailed upon him to depart, and he went. He had hardly entered the place of feasting, when the two pretty children ran to him, and embraced him, and received him with great joy, and sported and played with him.

The king, beholding this sight, pulled out his own beard, seeing that the winning ticket of this lottery had fallen to an ugly brute, the sight of whom made one sick. He was shaggy-headed, owl-eyed, had a nose like a parrot's beak, and a mouth like a fish. He was so tattered and torn, that no part of his body was hidden.

Sighing heavily, the king said, ""Has ever any one seen anything like this, that that light-o'-brains daughter mine should have it in her head to fall in love with this sea-monster? Has ever any one seen one that could take to the heel of such a hairy foot? Ah, infamous woman, what blind and false metamorphoses are these: to become a strumpet for a pig, so that I should become a ram? But what am I waiting for? What am I thinking of? Let them feel the weight of my just chastisement. Let them be punished as they deserve, and let them bear the penalty that you will adjudge. Take them out of my sight, for I cannot endure them.""

The ministers all took counsel together, and resolved that the princess and the malefactor, with the two children, should be put into a cask and thrown into the sea, so that they should thus end their days without the king soiling his hands with his own blood.

No sooner was the sentence pronounced than the cask was brought, and all four were put therein; but before they were thrown in, some of the handmaidens of Princess Vastolla, who were weeping bitterly, put inside the hogshead raisins and dried figs, so that they could live for a little time. Then the cask was closed, and taken away, and flung into the sea, and it kept sailing on wherever the wind blew it.

Meanwhile Vastolla, weeping with sore weeping, her eyes running two streamlets of tears, said to Peruonto, ""What great misfortune is ours that our grave should be Bacchus' cradle! Oh, could I but have known who it was that worked in this body to have me thrown into this prison! Alas! I have come to a sad end, without knowing the why or wherefore. O you cruel one, tell me, tell me, what magic art did you use, what wand did thou wave, to bring me to this pass, to be shut herein by this hogshead's hoops? Tell me, tell me, what devil tempted you to put into me the invisible pipe, and gain nothing by it but this dark spectacle?

Peruonto, who had for a time listened and pretended not to hear, answered at last, ""If thou want know how it came to pass, give me some raisins and figs.""

The princess, desiring to draw from him something, gave him a handful of each; and as soon as he had eaten them, he began to recount all that had happened to him with the three young girls and the fagot of wood, and how at last he had passed under her window, and how, when she laughed at him, he wished her to be with child by him.

When the lady Vastolla heard this, she took heart, and said to him, ""Why should we make exit of life inside this hogshead? Why not wish for this vessel to become a splendid ship, so that we may escape from this peril and arrive in good port?'

Peruonto answered, ""Give me some figs and raisins, if you want this to happen.""

Vastolla at once satisfied his gluttony, so that he should be willing to speak, and like a carnival fisherwoman, with the raisins and figs she fished for the words fresh out of his body. Peruonto said the words desired by the princess, and at once the cask became a ship, with all the sails ready for sailing, and with all the sailors that were needed for the ship's service; and there were to be seen some lowering the sheets, some hauling the shrouds, some holding the rudder, some setting the studding-sails, some mounting to the upper-main-topsail, one crying, ""Put the ship about!"" and another, ""Put the helm up!"" and one blowing the trumpet, and others firing the guns, and some doing one thing, and some another, so long as Vastolla remained on board the ship, swimming in a sea of sweetness.

It was now the hour when the moon played with the sun at going and coming, and Vastolla said to Peruonto, ""Handsome youth of mine, wish that this ship may become a palace, so that we may be more secure. You know the proverb, 'Praise the sea, but dwell on shore.'""

Peruonto answered, ""If you want this to happen, give me some figs and raisins,"" and she at once gave him what he asked for.

Peruonto, having eaten, wished his wish, and the ship became a beautiful palace, adorned in all points, and furnished with such splendor that nothing was wanting. So that the princess, who would have parted with life easily but a short time before, now would not have exchanged her place with the highest lady in the world, seeing that she was served and entreated as a queen.

Then, to put a seal, upon her good fortune, she begged Peruonto to obtain the grace of becoming handsome and polished, so that they could be happy together, for although the proverb says, ""Better a pig for a husband than an emperor for a friend,"" if he could change his looks she would take it as the greatest good fortune.

Peruonto once again answered, ""Give me some figs and raisins, if you want this to happen,""

Vastolla at once responded with the raisins and figs, so that as soon as the wish was spoken he became from a sparrow a bullfinch, from a ghoul a narcissus, and from a hideous mask a handsome youth. Vastolla, seeing such a transformation, was beside herself with joy, and throwing her arms around him, tasted the sweet juice of happiness.

Now it so happened that at this same time the king, who from the day on which he had pronounced the cruel sentence had not lifted his eyes from the ground, was entreated to go hunting by his courtiers, who though thus to cheer him up.

He went, but was surprised by nightfall. Sighting from afar a light from a lantern at one of the windows of the palace, he sent one of his followers to see if they would receive him there, and he was answered that he could shelter there for the night.

The king accepted the invitation, and mounting the steps, entered, and going from room to room, he could see no person living except the two children, who kept at his side, saying, ""Grandfather! grandfather! grandfather!""

The king wondered with greatest wonder, and marveled with greatest marvel. Being wearied, he seated himself by a table, when he beheld spread on it by invisible hands a white cloth and divers dishes of food, of which he partook, and wines of good vintage, of which he drank truly as a king, served by the two pretty children, never ceasing: and whilst he was eating, a band of musicians played beautifully, touching even the marrow of his bones. When he was finished eating, a bed suddenly appeared made of cloth of gold; and having had his boots pulled off, he took his rest, and all his courtiers did the same, after having eaten well at a hundred tables, which had been made ready in other rooms.

As soon as morning came, the king got ready to depart, and was going to take with him also the little ones, when Vastolla and her husband appeared, and falling at his feet, asked his pardon, and recounted to him all their fortune. The king, seeing that he had won two grandsons that were like two grains of gold and two priceless gems, and a son-in-law like a jinn, embraced first one and then the other, and took them with him to the city, and commanded great festivals and rejoicings to be made for this great gain, which lasted many days, solemnly confessing to himself that ""Man proposes, but God disposes.""

Who found dame Fortune more unkind,
In that the greedy, pirate sinner,
Was balk'd of life as well as dinner.

As saith our tale, a villager
Dwelt in a by, unguarded place;
There, hungry, watch'd our pillager
For luck and chance to mend his case.
For there his thievish eyes had seen
All sorts of game go out and in --
Nice sucking calves, and lambs and sheep;
And turkeys by the regiment,
With steps so proud, and necks so bent,
They'd make a daintier glutton weep.
The thief at length began to tire
Of being gnaw'd by vain desire.

""Be still,"" the mother said, ""or I
Will throw you to the wolf, you brat!""
""Ha, ha!"" thought he, ""what talk is that?
The gods be thank'd for luck so good!""
And ready at the door he stood,
When soothingly the mother said,
""Now cry no more, my little dear;
That naughty wolf, if he comes here.
Your dear papa shall kill him dead.""

""Humph!"" cried the veteran mutton-eater.
""Now this, now that! Now hot, now cool!
Is this the way they change their metre?
And do they take me for a fool?
Some day, a natting in the wood,
That young one yet shall be my food.""

But little time has he to dote
On such a feast; the dogs rush out
And seize the caitiff by the throat;
And country ditchers, thick and stout,
With rustic spears and forks of iron,
The hapless animal environ.

""What brought you here, old head?"" cried one.
He told it all, as I have done.

""You, villain, eat my little son!
And did I nurse the darling boy,
Your fiendish appetite to cloy?""

To grace the seigneur's hall,

","As a Wolfe was Hunting up and down for his Supper, he pass'd by a Door where a Little Child was Bawling, and an Old Woman Chiding it. Leave your Vixen-Tricks, says the Woman or I'l throw ye to the Wolfe. The Wolfe Over-heard her, and Waited a pretty While, in hope the Woman would be as good as her Word; but No Child coming, away goes the Wolfe for That Bout. He took his Walk the Same Way again toward the Evening, and the Nurse he found had Chang'd her Note; for she was Then Muzzling, and Cokesing of it. That's a Good Dear, says she, If the Wolf comes for My Child We'll e'en Beat his Brains out. The Wolf went Muttering away upon't. There's No Meddling with People, says he, that say One Thing and Mean Another.

The MORAL
'Tis Fear more then Love that makes Good Men, as well as Good Children, and when Fair Words, and Good Councel will not Prevail upon us, we must be Frighted into our Duty.
REFLEXION
THE Heart and Tongue of a Woman are commonly a Great way asunder. And it may bear Another Moral; which is, that 'tis with Froward Men, and Froward Factions too, as 'tis with Froward Children, They'll be sooner Quieted by Fear, and Rough Dealing, then by any Sense of Duty or Good Nature. There would be no Living in This World without Penal Laws, and Conditions. And Do or Do not, This or That at your Peril, is as Reasonable, and Necessary in Families as it is in Governments. It is a Truth Imprinted in the Hearts of All Mankind, that the Gibbets, Pillories, and the Whipping-Posts make more Converts then the Pulpits: As the Child did more here for fear of the Wolfe, then for the Love of the Nurse.",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

Richardson, 1753), no. 166, pp. 130-31. ","A Wolf prowling about for his Supper, pass'd by a Door where a little Child was bawling, and a Nurse chiding it.

""Leave your Vixen-Tricks,"" says the Woman, ""or I'll throw you to the Wolf.""

The Wolf, hearing this, waited a pretty while, in hope the Woman would be as good as her Word. But the Child being frighted into better Temper, the Tone was turned, and he had the Mortification to hear the Nurse say, ""That's a good Dear! If the Wolf comes for my Child, we'll e'en beat his Brains out.""

Upon which the Wolf went muttering away as fas as he could.

Moral
An ingenuous Spirit will be wrought upon by fair Words; but a perverse one must be terrified into its Duty, if soft means will not do.

Reflection
Terrors are as necessary to quiet froward Spirits, as Praises and Rewards are to encourage the Tractable. But yet we must apply this principally to grown Persons; for, as the Children or Infants, there cannot be a more pernicious Error than to terrify them, as is the comm Practice of foolish Nurses, with Bugbears, Hobgoblins, Raw-heads and Bloody-bones, &c. which often fix such Impressions of Fear and Apprehension on the Infant, as can never be rooted out of the Man.

75,The Nurse and the Wolf (1),Aesop (printed for Thomas Bewick),,"The Fables of Æsop, and Others, with designs on wood by Thomas Bewick (Newcastle: Printed by E. Walker for T. Bewick and son, 1818), pp. 265-66. ","A Nurse, who was endeavouring to quiet a froward child, among other things threatened to throw it out of doors to the Wolf, if it did not leave off crying. A Wolf, who chanced to be prowling near the door just at the time, heard the expression, and believing the woman to be in earnest, waited a long while about the house, in expectation of having her words made good. But at last the child, wearied with its own perverseness, fell asleep, and the Wolf was forced to return back into the woods, empty and supperless.

The Fox meeting him, and surprized to see him going home so thin and disconsolate, asked him what the matter was, and how he came to speed no better that night?

""Ah! Do not ask me,"" says he. ""I was so silly as to believe what the Nurse said, and have been disappointed.""

Application
Many of the old moralists have interpreted this Fable as a caution never to trust a woman: a barbarous inference, which neither the obvious sense of the apologue, nor the disposition of the softer sex will warrant. For though some women may be fickle and unstable, yet the generality exceed their calumniators in truth and constancy, and have more frequently to complain of being the victims, than to be arraigned as the authors of broken vows.

To us this Fable appears to mean little more than merely to shew how easily inclined we are, in all our various expectations through life, to delude ourselves into a belief of any thing which we desire to be true.

The lover interprets every smile of his mistress in his own favour, and is then perhaps neglected. The beauty believes all mankind are dying for her, and is then deserted by her train of admirers. The followers of the great reckon a smile or a nod very auspicious omens, and deceive themselves with groundless hopes of employment or promotion, in expectation of which, they, like the Wolf at the Nurse's door, dangle away the time that might be usefully employed elsewhere, and at last are obliged to retire disappointed and hungry, crying out perhaps against the perfidy of those in power, instead of blaming their own sanguine credulity.

","A Nurse, who was endeavouring to quiet a wayward, self-willed child, among other attempts, threatened to throw him out of doors to the Wolf, if he did not leave off crying. A Wolf, who chanced to be prowling near the door just at that time, heard the words, and, believing the woman to be in earnest, waited a long while about the house in expectation of seeing her words made good. But at last the child, wearied with its own importunities, fell asleep, and the poor Wolf was forced to return again to the woods without his expected supper.

The Fox meeting him, and surprised to see him going home so thin and disconsolate, asked him what was the matter, and how he came to speed no better that night.

""Ah, do not ask me,"" says he; ""I was so silly as to believe what the Nurse said, and have been disappointed.""

Moral
Be not too ready to give credence to the assertions of an angry man.

Application
There is no custom more common, nor at the same time more hurtful and pernicious, than that which prevails among nurses and persons of inferior minds, of telling children false stories and resorting to threats, with the intention of frightening them into good conduct. This habit is sinful in itself, as a departure from the strictness of truth, and is often most fatal in its consequences.

There are many well-authenticated instances on record in which a permanent injury in after years has been caused to the child; and many lasting fears, prejudices, and antipathies have arisen from the impressions created in the infant mind by these idle tales and threats.

Dean Swift, in his account of the kingdom of Lilliput, relates that ""nurses thus misconducting themselves were first soundly scourged, and then expelled from the island.""

Let it, then, be the first care of mothers or nurses never either to say to a child anything which is not strictly true, nor in a fit of anger to indulge in threats which they have no intention to carry out. If they adopt the conduct of this foolish Nurse in the fable, and conjure up an imaginary wolf or ghost to help them in the momentary emergency of a naughty fit, they will probably find, when it is too late, that they have thoughtlessly cowed the spirit of the child, and have planted in his mind thorns and fears which it will be beyond the power of their arguments or philosophy to modify or remove.

    One angry moment often does
    What we repent for years;
    It works the wrong we ne'er make right
    By sorrow or by tears.

This fable, however, refers to the conduct of the Wolf rather than of the Nurse. It teaches the folly of those who take too much notice of words spoken in a passion. Angry persons say more than they mean, and generally, as soon as the moment of calm reflection comes, are themselves sorry for their violence and indiscretion.

    L'ear our weak minds their rapid course along! ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

So he waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and the Wolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging his tail. But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out.

","James Hinton Knowles, Folk-Tales of Kashmir (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, and Company, 1893), pp. 267-71. ","In olden times there lived a great and wealthy king, whose greatness and wealth were the envy of the world. Many kings had assayed to fight with him and had been defeated, till at last he began to think that he was unconquerable, and became careless and indifferent as to the state of his army.

Meanwhile another powerful king had been carefully training his forces. He saw the condition of affairs, and determined to do battle with this king. The two armies met on a large plain, and fought bravely for several days. For some time the battle seemed to be equal, but at last the great and wealthy king was slain and his forces scattered. The strange king then entered the city and reigned in his stead. His first act was to banish the late king's wife and her two sons. They were sent out of the country without the least means of subsistence, so that the queen was obliged to pound rice for a ser of rice a day, while the two boys got what they could by begging.

One day the woman advised one of her sons to go to the jungle and cut some bundles of wood for sale. The eldest went; and while he was engaged in cutting wood he saw at a little distance a small caravan of loaded camels and mules attended by several men, who evidently were robbers. The boy was frightened, because he thought they would kill him if they knew he was there. So he climbed up into a tree to hide himself.

The caravan halted by a small hut in a part of the jungle near to this tree. He saw the men unload their beasts and place all the bundles inside the hut, the door of which opened and shut by itself at the mention of a certain charm that he heard quite plainly. He saw all this, and rememhered the words of the charm, and determined to enter the hut him self as soon as the robhers departed.

Accordingly on the morrow, when the robbers were well out of sight and hearing, he came down from the tree, went to the hut, and uttered the words of the charm that he had heard. The door immediately opened to him, and he entered. He found immense piles of valuable treasure in the place -- gold and silver, and precious stones, and sundry articles of curious workmanship were stored up there in abundance. He arranged as much of the treasure as he could place on a camel that he found grazing near, and then, repeating the charm, shut the door and went home. His mother was delighted to see the result of her son's day's work.

The following morning the younger prince thought that he also would visit this jungle and try his luck. So he quickly learnt the words of the charm and started. He arrived at the jungle, and climbed the same tree near the hut, and waited there patiently for the robbers' coming. Just before dark they appeared, bringing with them several loads of treasure. On reaching the hut they entered by means of the charm, as before. Great was their surprise and anger when they found that some person had been to the place and taken some of the things. They uttered such terrible oaths, and vowed such fearful vengeance on the offender, that the prince up in the tree trembled exceedingly, and began to repent his adventure.

In the morning the robbers again left; and as soon as they were well out of the way the boy descended the tree and went and repeated the charm whereby the door of the hut was opened. The door obeyed, and he entered. But, alas! the door closed as soon as he was inside, and would not open again, although the boy shouted till he was hoarse, and begged and prayed that he might be set free. Evidently the poor boy had omitted or added something to the words of the charm, and thus brought this misfortune on himself. Terrible must have been his feelings as he counted the hours to the robbers' return, and tried to imagine what they would do to him, when they saw him there! It was vain to hope for escape. He was shut up in a prison of his own making, and must bear the consequences.

Before nightfall sounds of approaching footsteps were heard, and presently the door opened and the robbers came in. A savage gleam of delight passed over their countenances as they saw the youngster crouching away in a corner and weeping.

""Oh! oh!"" they exclaimed. ""This is the thief that dares to intrude into our quarters, is it? We'll cut him into pieces and strew them about the place, that others may fear to follow in his steps.""

This they really did, for they were bloodthirsty and had no feeling, and then went to sleep. The next day they started off on their marauding expeditions as usual, as if nothing had happened.

While they were absent the eldest prince arrived to see what had become of his brother, and to help him in carrying away the spoil. His grief was inexpressible when he saw the pieces of flesh strewn about the place.

""They shall rue this,"" he exclaimed, and caused the door of the hut to be opened by means of the charm and entered.

He collected the most valuable articles that he could lay hands on and put them into a sack. Afterwards he emptied the contents of another sack on the ground outside the hut, and placed the pieces of his brother's corpse in it. And then, having repeated the charm and shut the door, he took up the two sacks, threw them over his shoulder, and walked home. On reaching home he had the pieces sewed up in a cloth and buried.

When the robbers returned that evening and discovered what had happened they were very angry. They resolved to find the thief, and took an oath to rob no more until they had accomplished their desire. They went to the city, and lodged in different parts of the bázár, in order that they might ascertain if anyone was living there who had suddenly become rich.

One of the robbers happened to meet with the tailor who had made the grave-clothes for the young prince who had been so foully slaughtered, and heard from him that the mother and brother of the boy seemed to have got a lot of money lately, but how he could not say. Some people said that they were members of some royal family, but he did not know.

Accordingly the robber went and found out the house where the queen and prince were living. He marked it, so that he might know it again, and then hastened to inform the rest of the band. However, the prince had fortunately noticed the mark, and guessing what it meant, went and marked several of the adjoining houses in the same way. He thus thoroughly nonplussed the robbers.

""This plan will not do,"" they said. ""One of us had better get to know through the tailor where these people live, and then go to the house and cultivate their friendship. An opportunity for despatching the prince would soon be afforded.""

This was agreed to unanimously, and the leader of the robber band was voted to the work. He soon made friends with the young prince and his mother, and was received into the house at all times as a welcome guest.

One day, however, the woman observed a dagger hidden beneath his coat, and from this and one or two other things that she afterwards noticed, decided in her mind that the man was no friend, but an enemy and a robber. She wished to be rid of him. Consequently one evening she suggested to her son and his friend that she should dance before them, and they agreed. In her hand she had a sword, which she waved about most gracefully. Now she approached the robber, and now she receded slowly and smoothly, and accommodated her gestures to a song, till at length she saw her opportunity, and running against the robber, struck off his head.

""What have you done, mother?"" exclaimed the prince, who was horror-struck.

""I have simply changed places with our friend,"" she replied. ""Instead of him murdering you, I have murdered him. Look! Behold the dagger with which he would have slain you.""

""O mother,"" said the prince, ""how shall I ever he able to repay you for your watchfulness over me. I did not notice anything wrong about the man. I never saw his dagger before. This must be one of the robbers, come to wreak vengeance on me for taking some of their treasure.""

When the robber band knew of the death of their leader they divided the spoil and retired to their different villages.

The young prince married, and became a banker and prospered exceedingly. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

I take a little meal and I mix it with a great deal of bran and so manage to make bread. It is well nigh a year since my children have had any relish with their meals; they get nothing but bread and water.""

He answered her: ""And yet your children are so strong, while mine, with all their feeding and the comforts they enjoy, are always ailing!""

The poor woman said, ""God has given us poverty and hunger, but thanks be to Heaven, our children are hale and hearty. Now, therefore, I have come to beg you, if you have any work, not to send for anyone but me, so may God send health to your children!"" and as she spoke these words, the tears ran from her eyes like a river.

Then he called his wife and said to her: ""Have we any work for her to come and do for us daily, so that she may not sit idle?""

His wife answered him: ""Let her come twice a week and knead bread for us.""

When she heard these words she was glad, for she thought at once, that when she kneaded that fine white bread they would give her some of it, and her poor children would eat and rejoice. So she rose to go away.

And they said to her: ""Good-bye, and remember to come tomorrow morning.""

Thus they bade her farewell without giving her a scrap of anything.

As she set off home she said to herself, ""Would that I were rich, that I might open my cupboard, and bring forth a bit of cheese, or a piece of bread, or at least a little rice, or such like household store to gladden the hearts of the poor!"" and lifting her hands to heaven she said: ""Why, oh my God, hast thou made me so poor?""

And so she went weeping home where her children were waiting for her ever so eagerly, hoping she might bring them something.

But alas, poor thing, she came with empty hands.

The next day she went very early in the morning to the rich man's house to knead bread, and when she had kneaded it and ended her work, they bade her farewell and told her to be sure and come next time, without giving her so much as a cup of cold water.

As soon as she came home the children said to her: "" Have you brought us anything, mother?""

""No!"" she said. ""Maybe, when they have done baking they will send us a bit of bread.""

But in vain she waited, and when evening came not a loaf nor a plate of anything to eat appeared.

In two or three days they sent word for her to come and knead again, for they liked her kneading much. Then the poor woman arose and went again; and as she was kneading the thought came into her head, not to wash her hands till she got home, and then to wash them in a dish, and to give the wash to her children instead of plain water.

So as soon as she had done kneading, she hurried away, and when she got home she said to her children, ""Wait till I give you a little milk-soup.""

And washing her hands well of the dough, she filled a good dish, and gave each one a little to drink.

And they liked it so much that they said, ""Mother, whenever you go to knead, mind you bring us some of that broth to drink.""

A month passed while she went on at this work. And it seems that God blessed her children, for they grew fatter than ever.

One day as the rich man was passing by the poor man's house, he put his head in at the door and said, ""How do you do here?""

Then he turns and looks at all the children, and is amazed to see how fat they seem; and going out at the door in a rage, he went home to his wife and called her: ""Come here and tell me what you give to my sister-in-law who comes to knead for us.""

Now she was frightened at the way he shouted at her and said, ""I never gave her anything yet, because I am so afraid of giving her too much and your scolding me.""

Says he, ""You must have given her something, for her children are so fat they look as if they would burst.""

Then she swore an oath and said, ""She takes nothing away with her but her unwashed hands and she washes them at home, and gives the wash to her children to drink.""

When he heard that he said, ""Put a stop to that too.""

So the next day when the woman went to knead, her mistress waited until she had finished, and when she had done, said to her, ""Wash your hands well and then go.""

When the poor woman heard that her countenance fell, and she quailed with grief to think how she should go to her children, and they would beg the milk-soup of her.

When she came to her house her children were gathered together awaiting her, and as soon as they saw her come in they all cried with one voice: ""What have you got, mother?""

""Nothing, children; I forgot myself and washed my hands!""

All the children began to weep and to cry, ""How could you so forget us, as not to bring us that beautiful broth?""

While they were thus weeping and wailing, the father entered the house and said, ""What ails the children that they cry?""

Then she told him all that had happened, and he was sorely grieved, and made up his mind to kill himself, and so that his wife might not guess his purpose, he asked her for a bag to go to the hill and gather herbs. She gave it him, and he went away. And as he wandered about bewildered for a long while, he found himself at the top of a high crag, and there he made up his mind to fling himself down and die.

Then he spied facing the crag a great castle, and he said to himself, ""Before I kill myself, I may as well go and see what that castle is like.""

And drawing near he saw a tree, and he climbed up into it to see who lived in the castle. After a little while he looked, and behold, a number of dragons came out ! He counted them, and they were forty-nine. When the dragons were gone, they left the door open, for that was always their custom. So he climbed down from the tree and went into the castle and walked about it, and saw that it contained much treasure. Then he took his bag and filled it with as much as his back could carry, and went away at once, for he feared lest the dragons should catch him.

When they came back they perceived that a thief had been and stolen some of their money, and from henceforth they determined that one of them should always stay behind in the castle. The poor man returned to the town two days later, and found his wife weeping and refusing to be comforted, for she feared that his affliction had led him to go and kill himself. But when she saw him come back she praised God because he came alive.

Then said her husband to her, ""Wife, God has taken pity on our children and on you, who made bread so long at my brother's house, though they never gave you a morsel to feed our little ones. See, here we have enough to live for some time."" And opening his bag he showed her the coins.

She was a pious woman, so she said, ""The first thing you must buy is some oil that we may light a lamp to our Lady, which we have not done for so long.""

And her husband hearkened unto her and straightway went and bought oil, and when they had lighted the lamp they prayed with all their hearts and with tears in their eyes.

The next day her husband arose, and the first thing he did was to buy a house; and he moved into it with his homely furniture and his poor children.

On the first evening he said to his wife, ""From day to day we will buy what we want for the house, but nothing more, for we must bear in mind how you used to give milk-soup to the children to drink, to save them from dying of hunger.""

""Yes,"" said she, ""I will never ask you for anything that we do not want.""

Two months passed during which these people lived happily. They did nothing else but go to church and help the poor. One day, then, the wife of the rich man came to visit her poor kinswoman, for she had heard from many that she was now well off, and she herself had begun to suffer misfortune; all her sheep had died, her fields had brought forth no crops, the frost had bitten many of her trees, and she had met with many other mishaps.

When the poor woman saw her without being in the least affronted to think how little she had helped her in her own misery, she welcomed her joyfully, and gave her the best seat, and put before her the best things she had to eat in the house; whereas the other, when she went, had only received her in the kitchen, and never asked her to sit down!

After some time, she said, ""Sister, pray tell me, where has your husband found work, that my husband may try and find some too, for we have fallen into great distress.""

And the poor woman answered her, ""My husband has not got any employment, but the day you made me wash my hands he went away -- "" and then she told her all that had happened.

Then the rich woman asked her to take her husband and show him the dragons.

""Perhaps,"" said she, ""we, too, may thus find succour.""

And the poor one said to her, ""When my husband comes this evening I will tell him, and your husband can go tomorrow, with a bag, along with him.""

When the poor man came home at nightfall, his wife told him what had passed, and he said to her, ""I will go and show him the place, but I will not go to gather more treasures for myself, for this which I have God blesses, and it grows from day to day.""

Next morning the rich man came with his bag on his back, and said to him, ""Good morrow, brother, how do you do? Are you well?"" Whereas at other times, if he saw his brother in the way he would turn his back upon him, or take another road, so as not to hear him say that he wanted any help.

But when the poor man saw him he got up and kissed him, and said, ""Welcome, brother; I daresay it's ten years since I had the happiness of seeing you enter my house.""

""Yes,"" said the rich one, ""but now I have fallen into distress, and know not what to do.""

Says the poor man, ""Let us go; perhaps you will have good luck yet, and get as rich as ever.""

So they set off for the hill. And when they got there he showed him the tree, and said to him, ""Go aloft and sit in the tree, and soon the dragons will come out. Count them. If there are forty-nine you can come down and enter the castle free from fear; but if, peradventure, they are but forty-eight, do not go in.""

With these words he went away. In a little while the dragons came out, and he began to count them. But it seems he counted them wrong, and instead of saying forty-eight he said forty-nine. So he came down as fast as he could and went into the castle, and eagerly looked about to see where the treasure was, that he might fill his bag and be gone with all speed, and as he stood there he heard a voice saying, ""So you are the thief, and have come back to steal more!""

And lo! out comes the dragon which had been watching in a room close by, and seizes him by the head and makes four quarters of him, and hangs them up at the four corners of the dwelling.

When the dragons came home, he said to them, ""There's no need to keep watch any longer, for I have hung up the four quarters of the thief, and they will guard our castle for us!""

And from that day forward they determined, none of them to stay at home, but all of them to go out, and so they began to do.

When two days had passed away the wife of the rich man got restless, and went to the house of her brother-in-law to ask him what they had done with her husband.

But the poor man told her what directions he had given him, and said, ""I don't know whether he has counted the dragons right, but I will go and see.""

And off he went. When he came near to the castle, he got up into the tree, and when the dragons came out he counted them with great care, and they were forty-nine in all. Then he came down and went into the castle and looked right and left for his brother. And raising his eyes he looked aloft and beheld his brother hanging in four quarters, and he was sore amazed. Then he lost no time in taking him down, filling his bag with money and going away.

When he got home he felt very weary and sad, and said to his wife, ""Send someone to my sister-in-law's to tell her to come and take charge of her husband.""

And when she came she wept, and would not be comforted on beholding her husband cut into four quarters.

Then she said to the poor man, ""You must find me a tailor to sew him together, for I cannot bury him like that in four pieces.""

The poor man went out at once and got a tailor, who sewed him together.

When they had buried and bewailed him, the poor man opened the bag and gave his sister-in-law half the money, and said to her, ""Go and get succour for yourself and your children, and if you are in want again, do not blush to come and ask me for what you need.""

The widow went home with tears in her eyes. Let us leave them and return to the dragons.

When they reached their castle and found the dead man was gone, they all cried aloud, ""So the thief has an accomplice!""

The next day, therefore, they went into the town and sought for a tailor to make them forty-nine coats and forty-nine pairs of shoes.

So they said to the tailor, ""Mind you sew them well so that the stitches don't come out and that they fit us nicely!""

And they said it over and over again till the tailor got angry and said to them, ""Here's a fuss! Why yesterday I had to sew a dead man, who was in four bits, together, and they were quite satisfied with the job, though it was out of my line, and you with your coats are like to craze me!""

Then they said to him, ""Pray do you know the man who brought you the dead man to sew?""

Said he, ""Of course I do, he lives quite close, and if you like I will show you his house, so that you can go and ask him, whether the dead man was well sewed or not.""

So he took a dragon with him, and after walking twenty good paces, he showed them the shop.

Then they went away to a joiner's, and ordered forty-eight chests, just big enough for them to get into. When they were finished, the forty-eight dragons got inside, and the forty-ninth remained outside. And in the morning the dragon went to the poor man's place, and said to him, ""I have had forty-eight chests sent me and I want you to be so kind as to let me leave them here for the night.""

""Not for one night only,"" he answered, ""but let them stay as long as you like, and until it suits you to take them away.""

And he got porters to bring them in. Then the children of the poor man began to get upon the chests, and jump about, and play on them; and the dragons who were inside, from time to time, groaned and said, ""Ah, would it were dark that we might eat them all.""

One of the children was playing hide-and-seek with the rest, and he heard these words and these groanings. So he ran to his father and said: ""Those chests are bewitched; they are talking.""

Then the father thought a moment, and said, ""Forty-eight! and the one that brought them makes forty-nine.""

And he went close up to the chests, and put his ear at the key-hole, and he, too, heard the groaning. So he said to himself, ""Now, monsters, I'll make sure of you, now that I have got you in my power.""

So off he set at once, and went and bought forty-eight spits, and lighted his kitchen fire, and put them in, and made them red hot, and took them one by one, and thrust them into all the chests.

Then he said to his servant, ""Look here, my man, they have played us a trick, and put a dragon in a chest, and if we had not killed it, it would have eaten us all up.""

The servant was angry, and said to his master, ""Give it me, and let me go sink it by the sea shore?""

And he took it on his back, and threw it on to the beach. While he was on his way back, his master made ready another one, and said, ""You did not throw it far enough out to sea, and it has come back.""

And as often as he returned he did the same with all, and threw them into the sea. But when he got to the last one he grew tired of always coming back and finding one there again, so he walked right into the sea, and plunged it in deep, and when he got back to the shop he called out: ""Master, is it back again?""

And his master answered, ""No, no, it has not come back. You must have thrown it in very deep.""

""Aye, master,"" said he, ""I went right into the sea, and plunged it in, and left it.""

In the morning the dragon came to see what had become of the chests, and the merchant cunningly told him that one chest was found open, ""and I don't know,"" says he, ""what you had inside.""

He was seized with fear, and went to look at the chests, which were in the back part of the shop. And he found the chest was indeed open, and he trembled. The merchant lost no time, but seized him and flung him into the chest, and made it fast forthwith, and straightway spitted him, and so they were all done for.

And the man himself inherited the dragon's castle, and lived there as happy as a prince, and may we live happier still. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
676,The Two Brothers,Slavic,,"Alexander Chodzko, Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen (London: George Allen, 1896), pp. 3-9. ","Once upon a time there were two brothers whose father had left them but a small fortune. The eldest grew very rich, but at the same time cruel and wicked, whereas there was nowhere a more honest or kinder man than the younger. But he remained poor, and had many children, so that at times they could scarcely get bread to eat. At last, one day there was not even this in the house, so he went to his rich brother and asked him for a loaf of bread. Waste of time! His rich brother only called him beggar and vagabond, and slammed the door in his face.

The poor fellow, after this brutal reception, did not know which way to turn. Hungry, scantily clad, shivering with cold, his legs could scarcely carry him along. He had not the heart to go home, with nothing for the children, so he went towards the mountain forest. But all he found there were some wild pears that had fallen to the ground. He had to content himself with eating these, though they set his teeth on edge. But what was he to do to warm himself, for the east wind with its chill blast pierced him through and through.

""Where shall I go?"" he said; ""what will become of us in the cottage? There is neither food nor fire, and my brother has driven me from his door.""

It was just then he remembered having heard that the top of the mountain in front of him was made of crystal, and had a fire for ever burning upon it. ""I will try and find it,"" he said, ""and then I may be able to warm myself a little.""

So he went on climbing higher and higher till he reached the top, when he was startled to see twelve strange beings sitting round a huge fire. He stopped for a moment, but then said to himself, ""What have I to lose? Why should I fear? God is with me. Courage!""

So he advanced towards the fire, and bowing respectfully, said: ""Good people, take pity on my distress. I am very poor, no one cares for me, I have not even a fire in my cottage; will you let me warm myself at yours?""

They all looked kindly at him, and one of them said: ""My son, come sit down with us and warm yourself.""

So he sat down, and felt warm directly he was near them. But he dared not speak while they were silent. What astonished him most was that they changed seats one after another, and in such a way that each one passed round the fire and came back to his own place.

When he drew near the fire an old man with long white beard and bald head arose from the flames and spoke to him thus: ""Man, waste not thy life here; return to thy cottage, work, and live honestly. Take as many embers as thou wilt, we have more than we need.""

And having said this he disappeared. Then the twelve filled a large sack with embers, and, putting it on the poor man's shoulders, advised him to hasten home.

Humbly thanking them, he set off. As he went he wondered why the embers did not feel hot, and why they should weigh no more than a sack of paper. He was thankful that he should be able to have a fire, but imagine his astonishment when on arriving home he found the sack to contain as many gold pieces as there had been embers; he almost went out of his mind with joy at the possession of so much money. With all his heart he thanked those who had been so ready to help him in his need. He was now rich, and rejoiced to be able to provide for his family.

Being curious to find out how many gold pieces there were, and not knowing how to count, he sent his wife to his rich brother for the loan of a quart measure. This time the brother was in a better temper, so he lent what was asked of him, but said mockingly, ""What can such beggars as you have to measure?""

The wife replied, ""Our neighbour owes us some wheat; we want to be sure he returns us the right quantity.""

The rich brother was puzzled, and suspecting something he, unknown to his sister-in-law, put some grease inside the measure. The trick succeeded, for on getting it back he found a piece of gold sticking to it. Filled with astonishment, he could only suppose his brother had joined a band of robbers; so he hurried to his brother's cottage, and threatened to bring him before the Justice of the Peace if he did not confess where the gold came from.

The poor man was troubled, and, dreading to offend his brother, told the story of his journey to the Crystal Mountain.

Now the elder brother had plenty of money for himself, yet he was envious of the brother's good fortune, and be came greatly displeased when he found that his brother won every one's esteem by the good use he made of his wealth.

At last he determined to visit the Crystal Mountain himself. ""I may meet with as good luck as my brother,"" said he to himself.

Upon reaching the Crystal Mountain he found the twelve seated round the fire as before, and thus addressed them: ""I beg of you, good people, to let me warm myself, for it is bitterly cold, and I am poor and homeless.""

But one of them replied, ""My son, the hour of thy birth was favourable; thou art rich, but a miser; thou art wicked, for thou hast dared to lie to us. Well dost thou deserve thy punishment.""

Amazed and terrified he stood silent, not daring to speak. Meanwhile the twelve changed places one after another, each at last returning to his own seat.

Then from the midst of the flames arose the white-bearded old man and spoke thus sternly to the rich man: ""Woe unto the wilful! Thy brother is virtuous, therefore have I blessed him. As for thee, thou art wicked, and so shall not escape our vengeance.""

At these words the twelve arose. The first seized the unfortunate man, struck him, and passed him on to the second; the second also struck him and passed him on to the third; and so did they all in their turn, until he was given up to the old man, who disappeared with him into the fire.

Days, weeks, months went by, but the rich man never returned, and none knew what had become of him. I think, between you and me, the younger brother had his suspicions but he very wisely kept them to himself. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
676,Dummburg Castle,Germany,"Thorpe's source: Johann Gustav Gottlieb Büsching, ""Die Dummburg,"" Volks-Sagen, Märchen und Legenden, vol. 2 (Leipzig: Carl Heinrich Reclam, 1812), no. 72, pp. 343-52. ","Benjamin Thorpe, ""The Dummburg,"" Yule-Tide Stories: A Collection of Scandinavian and North German Popular Tales and Traditions (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1853), pp. 481-86. ","With dread the wanderer approaches the ruins of the Dummburg. Terror seizes him if night overtakes him in its vicinity; for when the sun goes down and he treads on the site of the castle, he hears from beneath hollow moans and the clank of chains. At midnight he sees in the moonlight the spectres of knights of former days, who ruled the land with an iron sceptre. In solemn procession twelve tall white figures rise from amid the rocky fragments, bearing a large open coffin, which they place on the top of the hill, and then vanish. The skulls also move about, that lie scattered under the rock.

For many years the Dummburg was the abode of robbers, who slew the passing travellers and merchants, whom they perceived on the road from Leipsig [Leipzig] to Brunswick [Braunschweig], and heaped together the treasures of the plundered churches and the surrounding country, which they concealed in subterranean caverns. Deep wells were choked up with their murdered victims; and in the frightful castle-dungeon, many miserable beings perished by the slower death of hunger.

Long did this lurking-place of banditti continue undiscovered. At length the vengeance of the confederated princes reached them. The hoards of gold, silver, and precious stones still remain piled up in the ruined cellars and vaults of the Dummburg; but it is seldom granted to the wanderer to find the doors, even if here and there he may discover ruined entrances. Spectres in the form of monks, and also living monks, are often seen descending into the rock.

A poor wood-cutter, who was about to fell a beech at the back of the scattered ruins, seeing a monk approach slowly through the forest, hid himself behind a tree. The monk passed by, and went among the rocks. The wood-cutter stole cautiously after him, and saw that he stopped at a small door, which had never been discovered by any of the villagers.

The monk knocked gently and cried: ""Little door, open!"" -- and the door sprang open.

""Little door, shut!"" he also heard him cry, and the door was closed.

Trembling in every limb, the wood-cutter marked the crooked path with twigs and heaps of stones. But from that time he could neither eat nor drink, nor sleep, so anxious was he to know what was contained in the cellars to which this wonderful door gave entrance.

The following Saturday evening he fasted, and on the Sunday, rising with the sun, he took his rosary and proceeded to the rock. He now stood before the door, and his teeth chattered with fear, as he expected to see a spectre in the form of a monk -- but no spectre appeared. Trembling he approached the door; he listened long and heard nothing.

In the anxiety of his heart he prayed to all the saints and to the Virgin, and then, without reflecting, tapped on the door, at the same time saying in a low tremulous voice: ""Little door, open!"" and the door opened, when he saw before him a narrow dim passage. He entered tottering, and found that it led into a spacious and rather light vault.

""Little door, shut!"" said he, almost unconsciously, and the door closed behind him.

With fear he now walked forward, and found large open vessels and sacks full of old dollars and fine guilders, together with heavy gold pieces. Here were also many beautiful caskets filled with jewels and pearls, costly shrines, and decorated images of saints, which lay about or stood on tables of silver in the corners of the vault. The wood-cutter crossed himself, and wished himself a thousand miles from the enchanted spot, yet could not withstand the desire of taking some of the useless treasures, to enable him to clothe his wife and eight children more comfortably, as they had long been in rags.

Shuddering, and with averted eyes, he stretched out his hand towards the sack that stood nearest to him, and took out a few guilders. Feeling now somewhat more composed, with less tremor and half closing his eyes he then took a few dollars, also a handful or two of the small copper coins, and again crossing himself, tottered back to the door.

""Come again!"" cried a hollow voice from the depth of the vault.

As everything about him seemed to whirl round, he could scarcely stammer out: ""Little door, open!""

The door sprang open. In a livelier and louder voice he now cried out: ""Little door, shut!"" and it closed behind him.

He ran home with the utmost speed, but uttered not a syllable about the treasures he had found; then went into the conventual church and offered up, for the church and for the poor, two-tenths of all that he had taken in the vault. The next day he went to the town, and bought some clothes for his wife and children. He had, he said, found an old dollar and a few guilders under the roots of the beech that he had felled.

The following Sunday he went with firmer steps to the door in the rock, did as he had done the first time, and supplied himself better than on the former occasion; still with moderation and discretion.

""Come again!"" cried the same hollow voice.

And he went on the third Sunday, and filled his pockets as before. He was now in his own estimation a rich man, but what could he do with his riches? He gave to the church and to the poor two-tenths of all he had, the rest he resolved to bury in his cellar, and from time to time fetch some as he required it. Yet he could not resist the desire first to measure his money; for as to counting it, that was an art he had never learned.

He accordingly went to his neighbour, a very rich man, but who starved himself in the midst of his wealth. He hoarded up corn, deprived the labourer of his hire, extorted from the widow and orphan, and lent money on pledges. He had no children. From this man the wood-cutter borrowed a measure, measured his money, buried it, and returned the measure to its owner.

The measure had some long cracks in it, through which the corn-dealer, when selling to the poor labourer, always shook some grains back to his own heap. In one of these cracks two or three of the small copper coins had lodged, which the wood-cutter, in throwing out the money, had not observed. But they did not so easily escape the vulture-eyes of his rich neighbour. He went in search of the wood-cutter, and asked him what he had been measuring.

""Pine-cones and beans,"" answered he confusedly. The usurer shook his head, and showed him the copper coins, threatened him with the law, the torture, and, lastly, promised to give him all he could possibly wish for, if he would tell him the truth. Thus he extorted the secret out of the poor man, and learned from him the powerful words.

The whole week the rich usurer employed in forming plans how he might at once get possession of all the treasures in the vault, as well as of those he thought might be concealed in the neighbouring vaults, or buried under the earth. He reckoned beforehand, that if he could get together all this money, he could by degrees, either purchase at a cheap rate from his neighbours, or extort from them. by false accusations and false witnesses, one acre and one hide of land after another, and thus make himself lord of the whole village, and, perhaps, of several of the neighbouring villages; then get ennobled by the emperor; and, as a robber-knight, lay the country around under contribution.

It did not please the wood-cutter that his evil-disposed neighbour should visit the castle-vaults. He prayed him to desist from his purpose, and represented to him the fate of many luckless treasure-seekers. But who ever held back a miser from an open sack of gold?

By threats and entreaties the wood-cutter was at length prevailed on to accompany him to the door; he was only to receive the sacks, which the miser would himself drag out, and conceal them among the bushes. For this service he was to have the half of all the treasure, and the church a tenth; all the poor also in the village should be newly clothed. So spake the usurer.

In his heart he had resolved, when he no longer required his aid, to throw the wood-cutter headlong into a deep well which was near the castle, to give nothing to the poor, and to the church only a few copper coins.

The following Sunday the extortioner, accompanied by the wood-cutter, set off before sunrise to the Dummburg. On his shoulder he carried a sack, which contained three bushels, into which he put twenty smaller ones, and in his hand a spade and a large axe. The wood-cutter warned him most strongly against covetousness, but in vain; he recommended him to offer up prayers to the saints for protection, but he would not. Muttering and gnashing his teeth, he walked on.

They now arrived at the door. The wood-cutter, who did not feel very easy in the affair, but was held back by the fear of the torture, stood at some distance to receive the sacks.

""Little door, open!"" cried the miser in a hurried tone, and trembling with eagerness. The door then opened, and he entered.

""Little door, shut!"" cried he, and it closed after him.

No sooner was he in the vault and saw all the vessels and sacks full of gold, and caskets of precious stones and pearls, and shining money, than he devoured them all with his eyes; then with trembling hands pulled the twenty sacks out of the large one, and began filling them.

At this moment there came slowly from the depth of the vault a great black dog with fire-darting eyes, and laid himself on all the full sacks, and then on the money.

""Away with thee, miser!"" cried the dog, grinning fiercely at him.

Trembling, the usurer fell to the ground, and crept on hands and knees to the door; but in his fear he forgot the words, ""Little door, open,"" and continued calling out, ""Little door, shut,"" and the door continued closed.

The wood-cutter waited long with beating heart; at length he approached the door. It seemed to him that he heard groans and moaning and the hollow howl of a dog, and then all was silent. He now heard the sound of the mass-bell at the convent, and counted his beads; then gently knocked at the door, saying: ""Little door, open!""

The door opened, and there lay the bleeding body of his wicked neighbour stretched on his sacks; but the vessels of gold and silver, and diamonds and pearls, sank deeper and deeper before his eyes into the earth, till all had completely vanished. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
676,Simeli Mountain,Germany,"The Grimms' source: Ludowine von Haxthausen (1795-1872), who heard the tale in the vicinity of Münster.  This story first appeared in volume two (no. 56) of the first edition of the Grimms' Kinder- und Hausmärchen (1815). ","Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Simeliberg,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm (Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales), vol. 2, 7th ed. (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 142, pp. 259-61. ","There were two brothers; one was rich, the other poor. However, the rich one gave nothing to the poor one, who barely made a living as a grain dealer. Things often went so badly for him that he had no bread for his wife and children.

One day he was pushing his cart through the forest when off to the side he saw a large bare mountain. He had never seen it before, so he stopped and looked at it with amazement. While he was standing there he saw twelve tall wild men approaching. Thinking that they were robbers, he pushed his cart into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen.

The twelve men went to the mountain and cried out, ""Mount Semsi, Mount Semsi, open up."" The barren mountain immediately separated down the middle. The twelve men walked into it, and as soon as they were inside it shut.

A little while later it opened again, and the men came out carrying heavy sacks on their backs. As soon as they were all back in the daylight they said, ""Mount Semsi, Mount Semsi, close."" Then the mountain went back together, and the entrance could no longer be seen. Then the twelve men went away.

When they were completely out of sight, the poor man climbed down from the tree. He was curious to know what secret was hidden in the mountain, so he went up to it and said, ""Mount Semsi, Mount Semsi, open up,"" and the mountain opened up for him as well.

He went inside, and the entire mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and in the back of the cavern there lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, piled up like grain. The poor man did not know what he should do, whether or not he could take any of these treasures for himself. At last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones lying where they were.

Upon leaving he too said, ""Mount Semsi, Mount Semsi, close,"" and the mountain closed. Then he went home with his cart.

He no longer had any cares, for with his gold he could buy bread for his wife and children, and wine as well. He lived happily and honestly, gave to the poor, and did good for everyone. When he ran out of money he went to his brother, borrowed a bushel, and got some more money, but did not touch any of the very valuable things. When he wanted to get some more money for the third time he again borrowed the bushel from his brother. However, the rich man had long been envious of his brother's wealth and of the fine household that he had furnished for himself. He could not understand where the riches came from, and what his brother wanted with the bushel. Then he thought of a trap. He covered the bottom of the bushel with pitch, and when he got the bushel back a gold coin was sticking to it.

He at once went to his brother and asked him, ""What have you been measuring in the bushel?""

""Wheat and barley,"" said the poor brother.

Then he showed him the gold coin and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would bring charges against him before the court. Then the poor man then told him everything that had happened to him. The rich man immediately had his wagon hitched up and drove away, intending to do better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures.

When he came to the mountain he cried out, ""Mount Semsi, Mount Semsi, open up.""

The mountain opened, and he went inside. There lay the riches all before him, and for a long time he did not know what he should take hold of first. Finally took as many precious stones as he could carry. He wanted to carry his load outside, but as his heart and soul were entirely occupied with the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried out, ""Mount Simeli, Mount Simeli, open up.""

But that was not the right name, and the mountain did not move, remaining closed instead. He became frightened, and the longer he thought about it the more he became confused, and all of the treasures were of no use to him.

In the evening the mountain opened up, and the twelve robbers came inside. When they saw him they laughed and cried out, ""Bird, we have you at last. Did you think we did not notice that you came here twice? We could not catch you then, this third time you shall not get out again.""

He cried out, ""I wasn't the one. It was my brother!""

But however much he begged for his life, and in spite of everything that he said, they cut off his head. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16
676,Open Simson!,Germany,Translated by D. L. Ashliman. © 2013. ,"Ernst Meier, Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Schwaben: Aus dem Munde des Volks gesammelt (Stuttgart: C. P. Scheitlin's Verlagshandlung, 1852), no. 53, pp. 187-88. ","Once upon a time there were seven robbers who lived inside a mountain, and with them there was an enchanted prince who had to do all the lowest work. He had to carry wood, fetch coal, and tend the fire, and everything that a kitchen-maid ordinarily would do. The robbers called him ""Hans Dunsele.""

One day the robbers brought into the mountain a princess whom they had abducted. Once while she was silently sitting in a corner she heard the enchanted prince singing to himself at his work:

    If only the queen knew
    That I am called Hans Dunsele! 

One day as the robbers were leaving, the princess hid herself and heard one of them call out: ""Open Simson!""

Then the mountain opened up, they went out, and the mountain closed itself again.

She immediately told this to the prince, and the two of them decided to escape. They made preparations, and one day when the robbers were away, the princess said, ""Open Simson!""

The mountain opened up, and they could freely leave. They went far, far into the woods, which became thicker and thicker, until they could no longer find a pathway.

Then the prince uttered the saying that he had so often sung to himself:

    If only the queen knew
    That I am called Hans Dunsele! 

Now the queen, his mother, had set forth in search of her enchanted son, and she just happened to be nearby while he was singing, and thus she learned the name that he had had with the robbers.

She called out loudly and cheerfully: ""Hans Dunsele!""

With that the spell was broken; the woods thinned out, and they found the pathway homeward.

Afterward he married the princess who had helped him escape from the mountain and had fled together with him, and he lived happily with her until he died. ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","Martha Warren Beckwith, Jamaica Anansi Stories (New York: American Folk-Lore Society, 1924), no. 100, pp. 129-30. ","Ali Baba was the brother of Kissem, but Ali Baba was a poor man and Kissem was a rich man. Ali Baba had two donkeys and an ox, -- all his living.

Ali Baba was cutting wood one day, he heard a company of horse coming afar. Took his donkeys and hid them in the bush, hid himself in a tree. Forty men were coming on; the head man came right to the cave where he was. Name of the cave was ""Sesame."" This cave was shut, would open by the word ""Open, Sesame."" And they brought forty bags of gold an' put in. Shut without word. Ali Baba saw them from the tree-top.

When gone, Ali Baba came down to the cave, said, ""Open, Sesame, open!""

Ali Baba took all the money he could, loaded it on the donkey. Must measure the money, but didn't have any measure.

Brother said, ""What Ali Baba got to measure?""

Took stuck the measure. Ali Baba measure, measure, measure, measure thousands of dollars. One piece stuck on the bottom.

Brother aska; Ali Baba tells all about it, teaches brother, ""Open, Sesame, open.""

Next day, Kissem took wagon, oxen, servants, went to the place, said, ""Open, Sesame, open!""

When he went inside, cave shut. When he went on, saw all the money, he forgot the word, said, ""Open, kem! Open, wem! Open, rim! Open, sim!""

Forgot that word entirely, can't get out. The men came back; ""Open, Sesame, open!"" Find Kissem. ""How came you here?"" No answer. Cut Kissem up in five pieces, hung them up in the cave.

Kissem's wife went to Ali Baba, said, ""Kissem no come here yet!""

Ali Baba went next day to the place. ""Open, Sesame, open!"" Finds the five pieces, takes them down, gets a cobbler to sew the five pieces up into a body. Robber comes back, finds body gone. Who took away that body, signifies some one knows the place; must find out who that is. Goes about town, finds a cobbler who said he joined five pieces into a body. Cobbler shows the house. He gets jars, puts a robber in each jar; one jar has oil.

Takes the jars to Ali Baba, says will he buy oil. Ali Baba says yes.

He makes sport for the great governor. Ali Baba had a maid by the name of Margiana, and she was very wittified, -- discovered the whole thing, but she didn't say anything. She danced so well, danced up to the governor to give her something. He put his hand in his pocket to get her something; Margiana get one dagger, killed the governor dead. Margiana got the oil red-hot, poured into all the jars that got men.

Ali Baba said, ""Well, Margiana, you saved my life and you shall have my son and as much money as you want, and as much money as will put you in heaven!"" ",Ashliman's Folktexts,2022-05-16

","""One time,"" said Uncle Remus, putting the ""noses"" of the chunks together with his cane, so as to make a light in his cabin:

    Brer Rabbit en ole Brer Wolf wuz gwine down de road terge'er, en Brer Wolf, he 'low dat times wuz mighty hard en money skace. Brer Rabbit, he 'gree 'long wid 'im, he did, dat times wuz mighty tight, en he up en say dat 't wuz in about much ez he kin do fer ter make bofe en's meet.

    He 'low, he did: ""Brer Wolf, you er gittin' mighty ga'nt, en't won't be so mighty long 'fo' we'll hatten be tuck up en put in de po'-house. Wat make dis?"" says Brer Rabbit, sezee: ""I be bless ef I kin tell, kaze yer er all de creeturs gittin' ga'nt w'iles all de reptules is a-gittin' seal fat. No longer'n yistiddy, I wuz comin' along throo de woods, w'en who should I meet but ole Brer Snake, en he wuz dat put dat he ain't kin skacely pull he tail 'long atter he head. I 'low ter mese'f, I did, dat dish yer country gittin' in a mighty bad way w'en de creeturs is got ter go 'roun' wid der ribs growin' terge'er w'iles de reptules layin' up in de sun des nat' ally fattenin' on der own laziness. Yessar, dat w'at I 'lowed.""

    Brer Wolf, he say, he did, dat if de reptules wuz gittin' de 'vantage er de creeturs dat away, dat hit wuz 'bout time fer ter clean out de reptules er leaf de country, en he 'low, fuddermo', dat he wuz ready fur ter jine in wid de patter-rollers en drive um out.

    Brer Wolf say maybe dis de bes' way, kaze ef de reptules git word dat de patter-rollers is a-comin' dey'll take en hide de ginger-cakes, en der simmon beer, en der w'atzisnames, so dat de creeturs can't git um. By dis time dey come ter de forks er de road, en Brer Rabbit he went one way, en Brer Wolf he went de yuther. 

Uncle Remus went on, with increasing gravity:

    Whar Brer Wolf went, de goodness knows, but Brer Rabbit, he went on down de road todes he own house, en w'iles he wuz lippitin' long, nibblin' a bite yer en a bite dar, he year a mighty kuse fuss in de woods. He lay low, Brer Rabbit did, en lissen. He look sharp, he did, en bimeby he ketch a glimp' er ole Mr. Black Snake gwine 'long thoo de grass. Brer Rabbit, he lay low en watch 'im. Mr. Black Snake crope 'long, he did, des like he wuz greased.

    Brer Rabbit say ter hisse'f: ""Hi! dar goes one er de reptules, en ez she slips she slides 'long.""

    Yit, still he lay low en watch. Mr. Black Snake crope 'long, he did, en bimeby he come whar dey wuz a great big poplar-tree. Brer Rabbit, he crope on his belly en follow 'long atter.

    Mr. Black Snake tuck 'n circle all 'roun' de tree, en den he stop en sing out:

        Consario wo!
        Watsilla, watsilla,
        Consario wo! 

    En den, mos' 'fo' Brer Rabbit kin wink he eye, a door w'at wuz in de tree flew'd open, en Mr. Black Snake tuck 'n crawl in.

    Brer Rabbit 'low, he did: ""Ah-yi! Dar whar you stay! Dar whar you keeps yo' simmon beer! Dar whar you hides yo' backbone en spar' ribs. Ah-yi!""

    W'en Mr. Black Snake went in de house, Brer Rabbit crope up, he did, en lissen fer ter see w'at he kin year gwine on in dar. But he ain't year nothin'. Bimeby, w'iles he settin' 'roun' dar, he year de same song:

        Watsilla, watsilla,
        Consario wo!
        Watsilla, watsilla,

    En mos' 'fo' Brer Rabbit kin hide in de weeds, de door hit flew'd open, en out Mr. Black Snake slid. He slid out, he did, en slid off, en atter he git out er sight, Brer Rabbit, he tuck 'n went back ter de poplar-tree fer ter see ef he kin git in dar. He hunt 'roun' en he hunt 'roun', en yit ain't fin' no door.

    Den he sat up on he behin' legs, ole Brer Rabbit did, en low: ""Hey! w'at kinder contrapshun dish yer? I seed a door dar des now, but dey ain't no door dar now.""

    Ole Brer Rabbit scratch he head, he did, en bimeby hit come inter he min' dat maybe de song got sump'n 'n'er ter do wid it, en wid dat he chuned up, he did, en sing:

    Den Brer Rabbit 'low he 'd hang 'roun' dar en fin' out w'at kind er hinges dat er door wuz a-swingin' on. So he stays 'roun' dar, he did, twel bimeby Mr. Black Snake came 'long back. Brer Rabbit crope up, he did, en he year 'im sing de song:

    Den de door open, en Mr. Black Snake, he slid in, en Brer Rabbit, he lipped off in de bushes en sung de song by hisse'f. Den he went home en tuck some res', en nex' day he went back; en w'en Mr. Black Snake come out en went off, Brer Rabbit, he tuck 'n sing de song, en de door flewed open, en in he went.

Den he come out, en de nex' day he went he tole Ole Brer Wolf, en Brer Wolf, he 'low dat, bein' ez times is hard, he b'lieve he 'll go 'long en sample some er Mr. Black Snake's doin's.

He went in dar, he did, en he gobbled up his belly ful, en w'iles he doin' dis Brer Wolf he gallop 'roun' en 'roun', tryin' fer ter git in. But de door done slam shet, en Brer Wolf ain't know de song. Bimeby Brer Rabbit he come out, he did, lickin' he chops en wipin' he mustash, en Brer Wolf ax 'im w'at de name er goodness is de reason he ain't let 'im go in 'long wid 'im.
