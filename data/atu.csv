The servant goes home to overhear the farmwife and her lover (often a clergyman). The lover hides. The servant pretends that he is supposed to do some job that threatens the lover?s hiding place: light the oven, clean the chimney, clean the wool. He is about to throw a chest in which the lover is hiding into water or to throw it down the stairs (he lets the lover free in return for a ransom). The lover hides in the calf?s stall and the servant drives him out with a whip. The wife wants to bring food outdoors to her lover, whose whereabouts she thinks she can locate by following certain signs along the way. The servant manages to alter the signs (e.g. he puts cloth on a horse to change its color) so that the wife brings the food to him instead [K1571]. The wife sends the servant to take food to her lover (to invite him to a meal). The servant drops the food on the way and tells the lover that the husband has discovered the adultery. On his way back, he tells the farmer that the lover has refused to come. Or, he says that the lover wants the farmer to help him repair his broken plow [K1573]. When the lover sees the farmer collecting the food strewn along the way, he thinks he is coming with the tools or going to attack him, so he runs away. Meanwhile, the servant has told the wife that her husband knows about her adultery, so she runs away. He tells the farmer that she left because her village (house) burned down. Or that she had promised always to cook food just as good as she did today if her husband can catch up with her. The farmer immediately goes after her. (Cf. Type 1741.) In the end, the wife confesses and she (and her lover) are possibly punished [K1572]. Cf. Types 1358, 1358A?1358C.", Documented in the 16th century.," 1358, 1358A?C, 1380, and 1535."

The giant throws a stone high into the air and the tailor throws his bird [K18.3] (cf. Type 1062).

The tailor uses tricks to accomplish the tasks. After the tailor marries the princess, he accidentally (by speaking of needle and thread, or in his sleep) discloses his humble origin [H38.2.1].

For example, the millstone falls down onto robbers who are counting their treasure; the robbers flee leaving the money behind (cf. Type 1653). Or, one brother who has inherited a rope uses it by the shore to make sandals.

This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) Travelers (a single traveler) in need of a place to spend the night climb a tree. While they are hidden in the branches, robbers (rich people) settle under the tree to count their booty (to have a feast). The people in the tree overhear the activity below and let something (e.g. a door, cf. Type 1009) fall (accidentally). It lands on the robbers, frightening them so that they flee and leave their valuables behind. The travelers keep the booty and thus become rich [K335.1.1]. Cf. Types 1009, 1650, and 1875. (2) On leaving home, a husband tells his wife (wife tells her husband, mother tells her son) to mind (shut or lock) the door, but instead she takes it with her [K1413]. At night they climb a tree. The door falls, frightening robbers who flee and leave their booty behind [K335.1.1.1]. (3) Two (more) brothers exclude their youngest brother from their thieving expeditions because they think he is a fool. In order to get his own wealth, he climbs a tree, taking a door (corpse, millstone) along with him. He lets it fall on robbers who have gathered under the tree. They run away, leaving their booty behind [K335.1.1.1, K335.1.2.1]. (Previously Types 1653B and 1653C.) Cf. Types 326B*, 1525R. (4) A person in a tree drops part of a dead animal (head, intestines, hide) on rich people (robbers) who are enjoying a feast under the tree [K335.1.1.2]. (Previously Types 1653D and 1653E.) (5) Robbers overhear a foolish man (woman) talking to himself. The robbers misinterpret the words, think they have been discovered, and flee, leaving their booty behind [K335.1, N611, N611.2, N612].

When the rider climbs the tree, the pretended cripple jumps on his horse and rides away."," Version (2) is documented in the 17th centuries.

(Previously Type 1525H2, 1525H3.) (3) Two thieves trick each other. First, they exchange supposedly-valuable sacks which turn out to contain only worthless things (sand, hay, etc.) [J1516]. Next, they exchange jobs (tending an unmanageable cow, carrying water in a leaky pot, etc.) because each thinks the other?s work is easier, and both come to grief [J2431.1, K1687]. Together they find (steal) a treasure and each tries to trick the other out of his share. One hides in a chest, and the other, believing it to be full of gold, carries it home [K307.1].

The nephew (apprentice thief) wants to keep all the meat for himself. He takes the hide to a waterhole. Hiding in the bushes, he beats the hide as if he himself were being beaten. He cries and shouts that it was not he but his uncle who stole the ox. The uncle thinks that the boy has been caught, so he runs away [K335.1.3]. In some variants the thieves cut the tail (head) off the ox (sheep) and stick it in the mouth (backside) of another, so that it looks as if one ox has eaten the other. Or they put the severed part in a swamp [K404.1]. When the owner swims out to get his drowned animal, they steal his clothes. Cf. Type 1004. (2) A boy (woman) tells a passing thief (soldier) that he has lost a silver cup (pail, etc.) in the well (river), and asks him to get it back for him. The thief takes off his clothes, climbs in the well, and finds nothing. When he comes back up, he finds that his clothes have been stolen [K345.2].", Version (2) first appears in Persian literature in the 13th century.," 1535, 1740."

The criterion for the division is their skill in quoting Scripture. The minister cuts off an ear and says, ?So Peter cut off an ear from the servant of the high priest.? The sexton cuts the head off the pig (the second ear) and says, ?So was the head of John the Baptist cut off? (?and they gave him a box on the ear?). The schoolmaster considers for a long time. Finally he spreads a cloth and puts the rest of the pig (head) on it and says, ?And then they took the holy body away.? [J1242.1].

A poor man (merchant, baker) causes a series of accidents: He pulls off the tail of a (borrowed) horse (one of two oxen that he has borrowed dies). The owner sues him. The poor man flees into a house and frightens (hits) a pregnant woman so that she miscarries. Or a woman invites him in out of the rain, and he sits on her sofa and accidentally kills her child. Her husband (the woman) sues him as well. Out of desperation, the poor man jumps from a high tower (bridge) and kills a passer-by [N320, N330], whose brother (other relative) sues him. The injured parties bring the poor man before a judge. The judge decides as follows [J1173]: The poor man should keep the borrowed horse until its tail grows back. He should impregnate the mother with another child (and her husband should hit her again, to give her another miscarriage). Her husband rejects this settlement and withdraws his suit. (In some variants, he has to pay a fine to the poor man.) The brother (other relative) of the killed man should jump from the tower upon the poor man in order to kill him. He also withdraws his suit. (In some variants he also has to pay a fine to the poor man.). (The poor man leaves with the horse and his settlements.) Some variants have a frame tale: The judge persuades a baker (merchant) to give him a goose (duck) that belongs to someone else. He promises to protect him if the owner of the goose accuses him of theft. Then as above. Cf. Types 926C.", The episodes of this type also appear individually or in other sequences.

They invite all the villagers to a big dinner. The family waits in vain for a return invitation from the guests. (2) A rich man kills his poor brother?s only horse, and gives him its skin. Main part: The poor man goes to the city to sell the cowhide (oxhide, horsehide). During the night he discovers the innkeeper?s wife with her lover and threatens to expose them. They bribe him not to tell. Or, a merchant believes that the poor man?s sacks of refuse contain valuables. The merchant takes the sacks, and in return leaves his goods for the poor man. Back at home, the poor man tells his rich brother (the villagers) that he received all the money for the animal hide (the refuse). The brother (villagers) kills all his cattle in order to sell their hides, and impoverishes himself (tries to sell refuse and is beaten). In some variants the rich man is angry and tries to kill his brother, but instead he kills an old relative (dead man) who is lying in his place in bed. The poor man takes the corpse away, and convinces an innocent man that he killed the person. This man bribes the poor man not to tell. Then the poor man claims that he had sold the corpse. Cf. Types 1536C, 1537. The rich man kills all his relatives, hoping to sell their corpses. He is put in prison and set free after he serves his sentence. Still angry, he tries to drown his brother. The poor brother, confined in a sack (chest), finds a passer-by (shepherd, rich lord) who is willing to trade places with him. After this person has been thrown into the water, the poor man comes back to the village with the sheep (horse, riches) and claims he found them under the water. The jealous rich man (the villagers) jumps into the water and drowns. Cf.

The woman confirms the rich man?s suspicion and cries out (curses, makes noise). The poor brother opens the chest, strangles the woman (kills her in some other way), and puts some food (cheese, meat, sausage, bread) in her mouth. The rich brother opens the chest, sees that the woman is dead, and thinks she has suffocated. He wants to keep her death secret and bribes the poor brother not to tell any one and to bury her. Later, the poor brother digs her up at night (keeping some of her valuables) and sets her body at his brother?s door, where it falls over when the door is opened in the morning.

In some versions, the farmer sells his adversaries supposedly-wonderful objects, e.g. a messenger rabbit [K131.1], a pot that cooks by itself [K112.1], a pick that locates gold, a rifle that always hits its mark, or a self-propelled sled. Or the farmer promises to teach them to speak Latin and cuts their tongues off [K1068.2]. Some variants end with the farmer buried alive.

The sexton overhears and, hoping for the large repayment, gives the poor man what he asked for. The sexton claims to be the messenger of the saint, but the poor man refuses to repay the money to him [K464]. (2) A poor man (journeyman, farmhand, sexton, trickster) asks God (a saint) for a certain sum of money, no more and no less. A rich man (master, gentleman, priest, Jew) tests him by giving him (as a joke) 99 (999) instead of 100 (1000) (gold) coins. The poor man accepts them, saying, ?Whoever gave me these will surely give me the last one too,? (he counts the value of the purse as the missing coin, adds a coin of his own). He refuses to pay back the money and makes blasphemous excuses (God is old and forgetful, or He cannot count) [J1473.1]. Often the tale continues: The lender goes to a judge in order to force the poor man to repay his money. Before the case is tried, the poor man tricks the lender out of his overcoat, shoes, and often his horse. Even the judge is tricked by the poor man, who makes the lender so suspicious that the judge thinks he must be insane. (Cf. Types 1525L, 1642A.)

They give him what he wants but ask what he meant by his threat. He explains, he had to go on without the thing (had to work).

Sometimes the listeners realize what he has done, but they reward him anyway because they admire his cleverness. (2) A bald (mangy) man (with head lice), a man who scratches himself, and a man with a dripping nose agree (are ordered, often by the king) not to touch themselves. All of them manage to break the prohibition by telling stories which they illustrate with their forbidden movements. For example, the bald man says that his father bought him a fur cap, and he mimics putting it on and taking it off. The scratching man says his father bought him clothes, and touches himself to show where they did not fit. The man with the dripping nose calls them both liars and points at them by rubbing his nose twice with his fingers. (3) A god offers a prize (his daughter, an ox, both) to whichever animal can clear a field of nettles without scratching himself. After other animals try and fail, a certain animal (spider, Brer Rabbit) wins the prize by disguising his scratching in his animated description of the ox. (4) Two men (a Jew and a Russian) agree not to scratch. Each tries to make the other break the agreement. For example, the Jew sprinkles pepper in the Russian?s shirt, and the Russian puts lice in the Jew?s trousers. When the Russian can resist no longer, he says that his uncle received medals from the czar, which he wore ?here and here and here,? thus scratching those places. The Jew replies that his uncle received so many medals that he had to put them in his trousers? pocket and feel around for them ? which he demonstrates."," This tale originates in medieval Arabian literature.

This type is usually a framework into which other anecdotes of stupid people are set. Its basic form is as follows: Following a quarrel in which the husband complains that he works hard while his wife stays comfortably at home, a married couple agree to exchange work. Or, the husband (son) is unable to work outside. His wife (mother) must do the outdoor work for him, while he does the housework. Often, the wife gives her husband instructions about what work he should do. He does not pay attention and wastes half the day resting. The man tries to do several chores at once, and does everything wrong so that he suffers a series of accidents, e.g. he leans over the well while he is carrying the butterchurn on his back, so that the cream falls into the water (previously Type 1408A), he lets wine or beer run out of the cask and throws flour on top of it to dry the floor [J2176.1] (cf. Type 1387), he lets the cow graze on the roof [J2132.2] (cf. Type 1210), bathes the baby in boiling water [J2465.4] (cf. Type 1013), or demands that the pots walk home by themselves [J1881.1.3] (cf. Type 1291A), etc. When the wife returns home, she finds that her husband has made a mess and that everything is in chaos. The man admits that he had undervalued his wife?s work, and they agree that both of them should go back to their accustomed duties [J2431]. Or, the couple do not become reconciled: the wife beats her husband and drives him away."," Early version see Basile, Pentamerone (I,4)."," 1210, 1387, 1643, 1653, 1685, 1696, and also 1218, 1313, 1384, and 1642."

Two brothers (kings, knight and king, friends) discover that their wives have lovers. Hoping to distance themselves from this problem, the brothers set out on a journey. They meet a man (fakir, demon, etc.) who carries a small case (shrine) with him. When the man takes a rest, he opens the case and a beautiful woman comes out. The couple enjoy themselves and the man goes to sleep. The woman then seduces the two travelers. (Or, she also releases a lover from such a case that she carried with her.)

He takes along two (more) horses (symbols of masculinity) and many eggs (nuts, hens, other symbols of femininity, agricultural products that belong to the female sphere of work). Wherever a husband rules the house, the traveler gives him a horse, and wherever a wife is the master, she receives an egg. There is a great demand for eggs [T252.1]. Finally the traveler finds a man who claims to be master. When this man chooses a horse, his wife contradicts him and he has to settle for an egg. (2) A ham is offered as a price to any man who does not regret his marriage vow during the following year (and a day), or who can prove that he is not afraid of his wife. (3) A piece of bacon is hung at the city gate with a written message: ?It will go to whichever husband will swear that his wife does not dominate him.? The farmer who claims the bacon refuses to hide it under his smock, because he is afraid of what his wife will say if he gets marks from the fat on his Sunday coat. (4) A priest asks all the men who consider themselves to be masters of their house to sing the song ?Christ Is Risen?. All the men are silent and all the women (only one man) sing. Or the priest sings the song by himself. The next year, even he is silent, because now he has a housekeeper."," Documented in the Middle Ages, e.g. Jacques de Vitry, Sermones communes (Jacques de Vitry/Frenken, No. 61).

It takes a whole day to pull up the turnip, and seven days for a swallow to fly around it. A sow (hare) eats her way into the turnip, which grows back around her. When the turnip is cut open, the sow is found inside with seven piglets (seven cartloads of hares are found inside). Fifteen men uproot the turnip using levers, and two horses are needed to move it. A boat is made from its rind. The cabbage (mushroom) is so big that an entire regiment of soldiers fits under its leaves (cap). Part of it is used to make soup for a battallion, but the rest of the vegetable is still too big to pass through the lock of the canal. Six men work for six weeks to dig up the potato, but they excavate only its top half. A stalk of rye is so fat that a hog can go through it, or a man can drive a horse and wagon through the stalk and turn around inside it. Five men can stand on its stump. One grain is so big that just cutting it in two yields a bucket of sawdust. The tobacco is so tall that, to prune it, nine ladders have to be stacked one on top of the other.

He asks them to sing and eats them one by one afterwards (see Type 20C). Often the fox pretends to go on a pilgrimage (to a convent). Other animals (chicken, duck, goose, magpie, sparrow) go along with him. The fox asks to hear their confessions or accuses them of sins which are characteristic of the different kinds of animals. Then the fox eats them as a punishment. In some variants the fox tells the rooster (partridge, lark) that he has become religious and repents his past actions [K2027], or he dresses as a nun [K2285]. Then he reproaches the rooster with his sins (his polygamy) and offers to hear his confession. When the rooster comes near, the fox catches him and gobbles him up. Or, the rooster escapes by a ruse.

After the fox has eaten all of the children, he leaves [K931]. In north European variants the mother bear requires that the applicants sing well, and thus chooses the fox. In a few variants the fox and the goose raise their children together and take turns minding them. The fox eats the goslings. (2) The applicants must sing to prove that they would be good hired mourners. While the mourning husband organizes the burial, the fox eats the corpse.

The animal refuses. The person threatens him by asking someone else (person, animal, object, or element: e.g. dog, stick, fire, water, butcher) for help. The request is not granted (the help is postponed until some demand can be met).

He fulfills the task by choosing his dog as friend and his wife as enemy. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) When the master orders his servant (Aesop) to bring food to the person who loves him most, The servant serves his dog instead of his wife. The wife feels offended and threatens to leave her husband. The servant explains that only the dog would really love his master for it would return even if it had been beaten. (2) A young man violates the order that all old people should be killed. He hides his father with the help of his wife. Because of the intrigues of some envious men, the king demands that the young man, on pain of death, bring his servant, his friend (jester) and his enemy to the king. Following his father?s advice he takes his donkey as servant, his dog as friend (his child as jester) and his wife as enemy. The offended wife reproaches her husband for classifying her in this way after she had helped him hide his father. This betrayal turns her into his enemy and so he accomplishes the task. Cf. Type 981. (3) A young man rescues the devil (stranger, saint, ghost, robber) from a wolf (other danger) whereupon the devil promises pay for the service if the young man will bring his most faithful friend to the meeting. The man comes with his wife. The devil appears in a rich disguise and persuades the wife to kill her husband when he is asleep. Later he promises her marriage and wealth. The woman agrees. When she raises the knife (ax, stone) for the murder, the devil awakens her husband. He says that he has now repaid the man by saving his life, and refuses to pay the recompense. The man should have brought his dog instead of his wife. (The man must bring his real friend the next day. His dog follows him without being called, attacks the stranger, and proves its faithfulness.) Cf.

The master says, ?No, I wanted to know if it was crowded?? The farmer says, ?I did not count the people!? Thereupon the master becomes angry and plans to invite the farmer for dinner and then to set his dogs on him. On the way to dinner the farmer finds two hares. When the master lets his dogs loose the farmer releases his hares so that the dogs chase them [K318]. The master orders his servant to serve the farmer wine in the cellar and then to beat him. When the farmer takes away the plug from the cask, the servant has to hold the hole closed and the farmer beats him. Cf. Type 1539A*.

Cf. Types 1534, 1833J, and 1833K. Examples: (1) A poor man finds a purse with money in it and returns it to its owner hoping for a reward. The owner pretends that some money is missing, and that the finder took it already for his reward. The judge decides that, since the amount of money is different, the purse did not belong to the man who claimed it, and that the poor man may keep it until its rightful owner is found [J1172.1]. (2) A judge gives sticks to all the suspects in a court case and tells them that the guilty one?s stick will grow during the night. The guilty man cuts a bit off his stick and thus is discovered. (3) Someone announces to all the people in the village that the thief has a gnat on his cap (that his cap is burning). One man reaches for his cap and thus shows himself to be the thief [J1141.1]. (4) All the suspects are required to touch some object in the dark, and are told that the hand of the guilty one will be blackened. In fact, the object blackens any hand that touches it. The guilty man does not touch the object and is thus the only one whose hand is not blackened [J1141.1.4]. (5) In order to determine which of two women is the owner of a spindle of thread, the judge asks them what the spindle is made of. Only the owner knows the right answer [J1179.6]. (6) Disputants are ordered to fabricate a copy of the disputed object (precious stone) [J1154.2]. The owner and the cheater can do so, but the false claimants cannot. (7) A man (innkeeper) whose silver has been stolen summons his guests (employees) to the table and orders them to make various ridiculous gestures. When they are all engaged in this game, he commands them to put their heads under the table. Then he asks if the thief has head under the table. The thief answers, ?Yes.?"," The tale of the lost purse (1) appeared in the Disciplina clericalis (No. 17) of Petrus Alfonsus, and is now known throughout Europe.

(7) Do not marry a woman from abroad [J21.4] (be careful in your choice of a wife).

The son (person) disregards his father?s precepts (he thinks they are nonsensical) and suffers misfortune (in order to test the precepts, he acts against them). (1) After burying (hiding) an animal (human being) at a special place he tells his wife about it. When they quarrel and he beats her, she calls him a murderer and he is arrested. (2) His friend arrests him without listening to the true version of the event (he condemns him by jumping to conclusions without identifying the victim). (3) His turban sticks in the thorns of a tree, and his friend forces him to present himself without it. (The thorn tree he planted causes for a quarrel with a neighbor to whom he has to pay compensation.) (4) His adoptive son is willing to execute him, when an executioner is not available. (5) His hosts are annoyed by his numerous visits and offer him bad meals (mindful of his father?s advice, he keeps a sample). (6) He passes the night in a forbidden house (where a red-haired man lives). After taking a short-cut, he finds himself in a den of thieves. He escapes (with the help of a servant whom he later marries). (7) He finds out that the woman he intends to marry has a lover (he keeps his trousers as evidence). (8) He lets his wife go to a wedding with her family and her new-born child. Disguised himself as a Turk, he meets her and tries to seduce her and takes her son away. His mother-in-law sets fire to the house and says that the child was killed in the fire. The husband returns the child and forgives his wife. (9) Nobody wants to buy his horse because the price is too too high. It falls sick (is injured) and dies (he keeps the skin as evidence). (10) His mare, which his friend had borrowed, dies from overwork. When his friend apologizes for his mistake he forgives him. Finally he realizes that his father?s precepts were indeed wise. (1) Just before he is arrested, he shows the judge where to find the victim. (2) To his astonishment, it is an animal. (3) It turns out that the missing person (animal) is still alive. (4) He explains that he had only intended to test the precepts of his father. (5) He is immediately freed and prosecutes the persons who tried to harm him. (6) He invites his bride and his parents to his home. (7) He explains to them the significance of the souvenirs of his errors. (8) He casts off his bride.", Early literary version see Ruodlieb (11th century).," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 910B, and also 893, 1000, 1004, 1029, 1048, and 1062."

A poor man who cannot provide for his family takes service with a rich farmer for one year for a certain amount of money. After he has completed his service, the farmer gives him his choice of the agreed wages or a good precept. The man chooses the precept: ?Always follow the main road? [J21.5]. Disappointed by this he hires on for a second and then a third year after which he is given various precepts: ?Mind your own business? [J21.6] or ?Do not sleep where a young woman is married to an old man? [J21.3] and ?Always postpone your anger until the next day? [J21.2]. (For other examples see the numerous subdivisions in the motif-index [J21ff.].) Feeling discouraged the poor man gets ready to go home. His master gives him a loaf of bread (with money hidden inside [J1655.2]) which he should not cut until he reaches home [C320]. At a fork in the road the poor man follows the farmer?s advice and takes the old main road instead of a shorter new one [J21.5]. He later learns that he would have been waylaid by robbers on the new road [N765, J865]. At dusk he reaches a house where he spends the night. There he sees strange events, but he does not interfere [J21.6]. When he is about to leave, his host calls him back and rewards him with a large sum of money for his discretion (indiscretion would have brought death to the host?s wife [D700, D758]). After he has refused to sleep in a house where a young woman is married to an old man [J21.3], he witnesses a murder [K2213.3]. When an innocent man, who spent the night at the woman?s house, is condemned for the murder, he testifies to the man?s innocence [K2155]. When the poor man finally reaches home and looks through a window, he sees a stranger kissing his wife. He intends to kill the man, but fortunately postpones his anger at the last moment [J21.2, J571]. The stranger was his own grown son. When the family gathers around the table to celebrate their reunion, the poor man cuts the bread and finds all the money he had earned hidden inside [Q20.2].",NA," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 677, 910A, and also 300, 460A, 923B, 930, and 986."

The king agrees and the dying man gives three precepts to his son. First: ?Never associate with enviers or slanderers? (?Do not talk about what you have seen? or ?Do not dishonour your master?s house with adultery?). Second: ?Always sympathize with your master?s fortune and emotions?. Third: ?Never pass a church without going inside? (?Never neglect to go to mass?). When his father has died the young man begins his service at the king?s court. An envious man slanders him and accuses him of desiring the queen. When he, following his father?s advice, starts to weep when the queen weeps, his behavior is interpreted as proof of a love affair and it is decided that he must be killed. His adversary (slanderer) intends to throw him into the blast furnace of the ironworks (limekiln, mine, well, brewery, baking oven) or to kill him by some other means. He is sent to the place where he is to be killed. Those who are charged with his murder are told to kill the first man who arrives (he brings along a message, a letter commanding his murder [K978] or certain object such as a handkerchief or lemon). According to his father?s advice, the young man goes to mass on the way and is delayed. His slanderer (adversary), impatient to see him dead, arrives the place before him and is killed instead of him. The innocent young man then reports his slanderer?s death. He is restored to favor, or gains fortune, wealth and honour [K1612]. Cf. Type 930."," The observance of three precepts occurs only in some variants. In numerous variants type 910K is combined with 930. A clear distinction between the types is often impossible, as several variants belong to both types.

Type 981). They reflect on their behavior. (Previously Type 980C.) (4) The ungrateful son drags his old father out of the house by pulling at his hair.

The farmer blames him by asking which damned devil had done that. While the farmer fetches help in the village the devil pulls the animal out of the ditch. When the farmer comes back and sees that his cow has been saved, he exclaims, ?Thank God!? [N111.4.1]."," Aesopic fable (Perry 1965, 431f. No. 61, 454 No. 174).",NA

In the absence of her father (parents), a relative (friend, clergyman, guardian) attempts to seduce a young woman. When she rejects him [T320.1], he writes a slanderous letter (out of revenge) to her father accusing her of loose conduct [K2110.1, K2112]. The father commands his son to kill his sister [S322.1.3]. Out of pity (believing in her innocence) the brother spares her and gives the liver (heart, blood) of an animal [K512.2] to the king as proof of the murder. The girl is abandoned. A king (prince) finds her and marries her [L162]. When the king has to go to war (when the woman with her children wants to pay a visit to her father), he tells a servant (officer, soldier, dignitary) or a relative (brother, uncle) to take care of (accompany) his wife. A second attempt at seduction is made [K2250.1], and the woman?s children are often killed. She escapes [T320] in man?s clothes (disguised as soldier, officer or shepherd) [K1837] and works unrecognized as a servant in her father?s house (in an inn, as a shepherd). Despite the slanderer?s statement that the queen is dead (abducted, escaped, has murdered her children), the king searches for his wife (father searches for his daughter). Finally all persons concerned meet together and the woman in man?s clothes tells them what had happened (in the form of a tale). The family is reunited and the evildoers are punished. Cf.

The sultan sends a messenger to seduce the wife, but in vain [T320.1]. Disguised as a pilgrim (monk) [K1837], she reaches the sultan?s court. Through her harp-playing and her singing she wins the sultan?s favor. He presents her with a (three) Christian slave, who is in fact her husband [R152.1]. When the husband has returned home he wonders what happened to his wife. She arrives in her pilgrim dress and identifies herself as his rescuer. (2) A king goes to a foreign land, where he is thrown into prison. His wife disguises herself as a gusli-player [K1837], goes to the hostile king and receives his permission to take one of the prisoners with her. She chooses her husband [J1545.4].

A princess accidentally sees her schoolmaster eating a corpse (a human being) [G11.9]. She escapes. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A princess marries a prince abroad and gives birth to several children, who are kidnapped by the ghoulish teacher. The teacher leaves blood (other signs) that point at the mother as murderer of her children [K2155.1], she is imprisoned. When the prince goes on a journey, his imprisoned wife asks him to bring her a stone of patience (and a knife), which he does. The prince overhears his wife telling her sorrows to the stone [H13.2.2]. The stone swells and finally bursts because it cannot bear the sorrow (and she tries to kill herself with the knife). The prince embraces his innocent slandered wife, and the cannibal teacher brings back her children. (2) The princess finds a sleeping prince who can only be awakened if she would care for him for a certain period (seven years, seven months, seven days [Z72.2]). Just before the end of the time limit, the princess delegates her task to a female slave and falls asleep. When the prince awakens and sees the slave he thinks that she has saved his life. He marries her, and the princess becomes her maidservant [K2251.1, K1911.1.4]. The princess asks for a knife and a stone of patience. The king?s marshal overhears her telling her story to the swelling stone. When the prince listens, the stone bursts out of pity [H13.2.2]. When she is about to kill herself with the knife, the prince interferes. They marry and the slave girl is punished."," Important versions see Basile, Pentamerone (II,8 and cf. V,10)."," 425A, 710."

Cf. Types 950, 1525. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A ruler, roaming about incognito (during the night), meets some robbers [K1812.2]. They boast of their extraordinary abilities and qualities: One can open any door, one understands the language of dogs, and one recognizes any person he has seen once, etc. The king then states that he can save any person from the gallows. Together they rob the royal treasury. When the robbers are captured the next day, the king makes his statement come true. (Previously Types 951C and 951A*.) (2) A man (king, bishop, clergyman) is warned that he will die if he does not perform robberies. He does so, and meets a robber (often a man of honour, cf [3] below) from whom he learns that he himself would be murdered. They both exchange their identifying marks (caps, clothes) and meet again later. The leader of the conspirators is then forced to poison himself. His accomplices are punished and the robber is rewarded. (Previously Type 951B.) (3) A robber (soldier) can open any door with a certain magic object, but he only steals the profit that merchants have earned unjustly [K1812.2.1]. The king wonders about the robber?s wealth, disguises himself, and joins him. While robbing the royal treasury the robber prevents the king from stealing (criticizes his greed). The next day the king discloses his identity and rewards the robber for his honesty. (Previously Type 951A.)"," Variant (1) was documented in the 13th century by the Persian-speaking ?al?loddin Rumi, Masnavi-ye ma? navi (VI,2816?2921). Variant (2) is traced back to the chivalric novel Karel ende Elegast (12./13.Jahrhundert). Variant (3) seems to be an independent popular version of an episode from Karel ende Elegast.",NA

(Including the previous Type 676.) The tale consists of two parts: (1) A poor man (woodcutter) witnesses robbers entering into a mountain by pronouncing magic words like ?Open, sesame? [D1552.2]. He then tries the formula [N455.3], enters the mountain, and finds a huge amount of gold [F721.4, N512] which he takes home. (2) His greedy brother, who lends him money scales, discovers his secret when a piece of gold remains in the scale [N478]. The brother goes to the mountain, but he is dismembered by the robbers because he forgets the formula for opening the mountain [N471]. At the request of his sister-in-law, the woodcutter fetches his brother?s corpse, tells a cobbler to mend it and buries it. The robbers plan to take revenge. With the cobbler?s help they find the house of Ali Baba and mark it with a chalk circle, whereupon his maidservant (daughter) marks all other houses in the same way. The robber chief disguises himself as a merchant and asks the woodcutter for lodging for the night for himself and for his mules laden with jars (casks) of oil. When the maidservant goes to take some oil for her lamp, she realizes that only one jar is filled with oil, and that the robber?s companions are hidden in the others [K312]. She heats the oil, pours it into the jars, and kills the robbers. The robber captain escapes and comes back in disguise (as a suitor). At dinner he asks for a meal without salt (in order not to be obliged to his host). Thereupon the maidservant becomes suspicious, recognizes the robber, and kills him. As her reward the woodcutter marries her to his son (nephew).", Popular as a proverbial phrase.," 613, 735, 950, 956B, and 1535."

The woman favors him but does not like his poverty. In order to please her and to be able to marry her the young man murders a merchant and seizes his property. He presents himself as a rich man to the woman, who wants to know how he became rich in such a short time. When he (out of love) confesses the truth to her, she asks him to watch at the murdered man?s grave for one night (as a condition for their marriage). He does so. In the middle of the night the dead man rises from his grave, and asks God for justice. Thereupon a (God?s) voice comes from heaven saying, ?30 (40, 50) years from today you will be avenged? [M348]. The young man reports his experience. Knowing that the revenge will take place only after 30 years, the woman agrees to marry him.

(Including the previous Types 930B?930D.) A respected man learns by a predicition that a very young (newborn) girl will be his future wife [M359.2, M312.1.1]. Not willing to marry the ugly child, he tries to kill her [M370] by stabbing her [S115], by piercing her forehead with a needle [S115.2], or by adopting her in order to expose her afterwards [M371, S143]. The girl survives [R131], grows up, becomes very beautiful [D1860], and is married to the man. After the wedding he discovers the scar [H51] (needle) and learns from his wife?s life-history that the prediction has been fulfilled despite his actions [N101]. In various regions different forms of the tale have originated (previously Types 930B?930D): Northern cycle (Danish, Swedish, Estonian, Irish and Icelandic variants): A man witnesses the prediction of his future, tries to kill the girl in various ways by exposing her in water, by nailing her by her hands to a tree, or by sending her out with a letter that orders her death. The girls survives, marries the man, and is finally recognized by her scars as the predestined wife. Southern cycle with a wide regional dispersion (Greek, Slovene, English, Scottish, Irish, Estonian, Spanish and Brazilian variants): The marriage of the fated child is combined with the further condition: A ring that had been thrown into the water has to be found again. The ring is finally located in a fish?s belly [N211.1]. Cf. Type 736A.", Early literary treatments from the 9th/10th century by Li Fu-yen and Wang Jen-y?.,NA

Examples: (1) A father reproaches his son for his dissolute life, and the son kills him. A saint protects the sinner from despair and leads him to repent and do penance for his crime. (2) It is prophesied that a certain child (Judas) will bring great sorrow to humanity. The child is exposed but is adopted and raised by a childless queen. When she gives birth, the adopted child murders her child and flees to Jerusalem. When he steals apples in a garden he is caught there by the owner. He kills the owner and marries his widow, who is (although he does not know this) his own mother. (3) It is prophesied that a certain young man (Julianus Hospitator) will murder his parents. He flees in order to avoid this, and marries. His parents search for him and come to his house, where his wife invites them to rest in their marriage bed. When the son arrives home and sees two people in his bed, he thinks his wife is unfaithful to him and kills both of his parents. When he learns what he has done, he repents and does penance. His sin is forgiven. Or, a young man kills his parents (father only) because a false adviser has lied to him, saying that his wife is an adulteress. (4) After his wife dies, a lord falls in love with his own daughter. She gives birth to a son (Albanus), who is exposed. He is rescued and raised by a childless king. When the boy grows up, he becomes king himself. His natural father hears about this young king and marries his daughter to him. Before the adoptive father dies, he tells the young man what he knows about his origins. The young man?s wife realizes that she has married her own son. After the king dies, the three others go to the bishop and confess their sins. They are required to do penance for seven years. On their way home, they spend the night in a forest, and the father and daughter renew their incestuous relationship. Albanus discovers this and kills them both. He becomes a hermit, is killed, and later becomes a saint. (5) A drunken man spends the last of his money. The devil promises to make him rich if he will murder his own parents, but the man refuses. The devil gives him money anyway, and tells him to restrict his binges of drunkenness to one day each week. The man disobeys, gets drunk every day, and murders his parents [Q211.1, S22]"," Documented in the Middle Ages, e.g. Jacobus de Voragine, Legenda aurea (Julianus Hospitator), Gesta Romanorum (No. 18).",NA

His mother adds ivory tablets that describe the circumstances of his birth. The boy is saved [R131.14], baptized by the abbot Gregorius who gives him his own name, and grows up in the monastery. At the age of 15, the child Gregorius learns about his mysterious origins and leaves in order to find his real parents. Unwittingly Gregorius reaches his native country where his unmarried mother rules. When he saves her from a neighboring ruler?s unwelcome advances, she agrees to marry Gregorius. He has no idea that she is his mother. When she finds the tablets with the history of his origins she discloses her identity. In order to expiate the unwitting incest, she lives a pious life. Gregorius undertakes a pilgrimage as penance. At his request a fisherman fetters his ankles with chains to a rock in the sea [Q541.3] and throws the key into the water [Q544]. Seventeen years later Gregorius is chosen by an angel as successor of the deceased pope. Messengers from Rome look for Gregorius and arrive at the fisherman?s hut. In a fish prepared for the guests, the key for his chains is found (cf. Type 736). Gregorius is elected pope, and when he enters Rome healing miracles take place. His mother makes a pilgrimage to Rome in order to confess her sins to the pope. They recognize each other [H151.3]. She enters a convent. After their death both gain spiritual salvation (Gregorius is worshiped as saint)."," Documented in the Middle Ages, e.g. Gesta Romanorum (No. 81).",NA

Different manners of death are predicted: Death by natural forces (storm [M341.2.2], thunderstorm, falling tree), by an animal (wolf [M341.2.6], tiger, snake [M341.2.21], horse), by drowning [M341.2.3], when drinking water, when shearing sheep, by poisoning, on the wedding day [M341.1.1], by hanging [M341.2.21]. The three-fold death of a person caused by e.g. starving, burning and drowning [F901.1, F901.1.1, M341.2.4] is prophecied. Various precautions are taken in order to evade fate [M370] (the person is immured in a wall, isolated, hidden in a tower [M372]). Nevertheless the prophecy is fulfilled [M341.2, M370.1].

But the goat confounded the messages, and the dog [B291.2.1] arrived too late to change it [A1335.1.1]. Since that time, humans die forever. (2) God sends out a chameleon to tell humans that they should live forever (continue to live after death). On the way the chameleon is overtaken by a faster animal that delivers the opposite message [A1335.1]. (3) Formerly Death walked along singing [Z111], but he did not enter the houses of men. An old woman listened to him, liked his song, and repeated it. Thereupon Death followed the woman to her house and bedroom, and when she lay down (to have sexual intercourse) he strangled her. This is how Death first entered the houses of men. (4) In the year before they were to die, people neglected their responsibilities (they repaired their fences with temporary materials). Therefore, God decided that they should not know in advance when they will die [A1593].", Tales dealing with the ?falsified message of death? are widespread in Africa.,NA

He participates in a suitor-test for a mute princess, who is offered in marriage to whoever can make her speak [H343].

God commands Noah to build the ark in secret to escape the deluge [A1015, A1021]. In order to keep the work secret, the hammer is silent or the axe never gets dull on the stone chopping block [H1199.13, cf. H1116.1, F837]. The devil finds out the secret of the construction of the ark from Noah?s wife. He persuades her to give Noah an intoxicating drink [K2213.4.2], so Noah tells his secret and the devil destroys the ark [cf. G303.14.1.1, K2213.4]. Noah weeps and an angel instructs him how to rebuild it. By performing a washing ritual (water circle) Noah is able to keep the devil away from the ark. A gong calls the animals to board the ark. Some creatures are barred but finally they all enter: the serpent [A2145.2], the insects, the fly [A2031.2], fabulous creatures like the unicorn [A2214.3], the phoenix [A2232.4] and the giant [F531.5.9]. By a ruse the devil manages to enter the ark: he hides near Noah?s wife (at her breast, in her work-basket, in her shadow). She does not enter the ark until Noah calls her with a curse addressed to the devil [C12.5.1, K485]. On board, the devil, in the form of a mouse, gnaws a hole in the ark and tries to sink it [A1853.1], but a cat swallows the mouse. Helpful animals (serpent, hare, fish, dog) offer to close the hole with part of their body (tail, nose); smaller animals (tortoise, salamander, rabbit) are used as a plug. The serpent demands fresh (human) blood every day for its help. After the deluge, Noah throws the serpent into a holy fire. Its ashes spread with the wind and turn into bloodsucking fleas (lice, mosquitos) [A2001].",NA,NA

A man (prince, stupid boy, shepherd) makes a riddle based on unusual circumstances which he has witnessed (experienced) [H565]. (She marries him at this point and the tale ends here.) She sends her maidservants and then goes herself to him at night to learn the answer. He keeps her nightdress (braid) as proof [H81.2, H117]. In court, she answers his riddle but permits him to ask another. It refers to her night visit, and rather than answer it, she agrees to marry him. Different riddles are used, for example: (1) I ride on my father and wear (carry) my mother ? he has sold his parents and bought a horse and clothes (gun). (2) I ate (am) the unborn [H792] (cf. Type 927) ? a fetal animal (he was cut from his mother?s womb). (3) I drank water from neither heaven nor earth ? horse?s sweat (condensation from a lamp). (4) One killed three and three killed twelve [H802] ? his horse was poisoned, birds ate it, thieves ate the birds, and all died. In Turandot the princess herself is the one to set riddles for her suitors to answer [H540.2]: riddle of the sun [H762], of the ocean [H734] of the year [H721.1].

(?With money one can even win the princess?). The king is provoked and sets what he believes to be an impossible task. The young man receives as much money as he wants, but within a certain time he has to seduce (find) the princess [H322]. If he fails he will be condemned to death. The princess is hidden in a secret place (tower, room under earth, island, secret room, iron palace at the bottom of the sea) and guarded. The young man demands a hollow golden (silver, copper) animal statue (ram, goat, lion, deer, elephant, ox, horse, dancing bear, bird, eagle) and hides inside it [K1341.1]. The king buys the statue (which can play music) and installs it in his daughter?s room as entertainment. At night the youth steals out of the statue and amuses himself with the princess. When the statue is damaged it has to be sent for repair, and the youth comes out. Having won the contest the youth may now marry the princess (after she has become pregnant or has given birth to his child). In some variants a king offers his daughter to whoever is able to find her. Three sons of a merchant travel and reach the town where the contest is held. Two of them fail to find the princess and are killed. The third, on the advice of an old woman, orders a hollow golden animal, inside of which he is carried into the secret hiding place of the princess. When the statue is damaged it is taken back. In this way the suitor comes out again and is able to describe the way to the princess? hiding place (to show a token) to the king. Or, the suitor has to recognize the princess among several similar looking girls or animals; the princess helps him by giving a sign [H161, H161.1].",NA,NA

Because of her faithfulness to her betrothed (separation of the lovers by a quarrel or a war), a princess (along with her maidservant, sister) is confined by her father in an underground prison (cave, hollow hill, cellar, tower) [R45]. After many (seven) years she escapes [R211] and enters service in the king?s (father of her lover) castle [K1816.0.2, K1831] (without being recognized). She finds her lover about to marry another (witch, pregnant woman). (She works as lady?s maid for the prince?s new bride.) In order to conceal the pregnancy [K1843.1] (because of the hideousness or sickness of the bride) the heroine is asked to take her place on wedding day. On the way to the church she talks to her horse [H13.1], to the bridge, and to the church-door [H13.2], and thus reminds the prince of his first love.

She should estimate the value of the king?s beard or weave a cloth with only a few threads. Or she has to make boiled eggs hatch [J1191.2, H1023.1.1] (cf. Type 821B) or carve a fowl and give appropriate pieces to all members of the family (cf. Type 1533). The king marries the girl [L162] but orders her not to meddle in his affairs. When he settles a dispute between two farmers unjustly, she advises the wronged man to show the king the absurdity of his decision by an equally foolish act [J1191.1]. When the king casts her out and allows her only to take with her the one thing she holds dearest [J1545.4], she takes her sleeping husband with her and thus moves him to forgive her.", The motifs of hatching boiled eggs and of sowing boiled seed probably come from Type 821B.," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 875A, 921, 922, and also 821B, 875B, 875D, 875E, 876, 879, 920, 920A, 958, and 1533."

The contents and combinations of the impossible tasks and their countertasks vary in the numerous variants of this type, where a person imposes an impossible task on someone who, in return, imposes an equally absurd countertask. (1) A prince (king) makes an impossible demand [H1010]: Three unwed girls (virgins) should all give birth to a child at the same time (within nine months). Being summoned to the palace they present themselves disguised as pregnant women by hiding cushions under their dresses. When they are granted a wish, the youngest sister asks for roasted snow [H951, J2121]. Being unable to produce it, the prince realizes the absurdity of his own demand and marries the girl. (2) A king imprisons an adviser and will release him only on the condition that he brings a horse that is neither black nor white, neither gray nor reddish brown. The adviser claims to have such a horse at home, but the king cannot fetch it on any day of the week. The king sees the absurdity of his own demand and releases his prisoner. (3) A prince finds a block of white marble so beautiful that he orders his tailor to sew him a suit out of the stone [H1021.9]. No tailor in the kingdom can do this and he orders them all to be killed. Finally an elderly tailor is asked to make the suit. On the advice of his granddaughter he asks the prince for meat made of mud and a cake of snow for lunch. Thus he points to his master?s own absurd task, whereupon the prince recognizes his mistake and marries the granddaughter. (4) A king orders his adviser (boy) to bring him bull?s milk [H1024.1] or to have a bull bear a calf. The adviser?s daughter pretends that her father has given birth to a child [H1024.1.1.1, J1533] and the king thus sees the absurdity of his order. (Previously Type 875B1.) (5) A Muslim king orders his adviser to convert him into a Hindu. The adviser stands by the road rubbing a donkey. When the king asks why, the adviser explains that he is trying to change it into a horse (cow). The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [J1536.2]. (Previously Type 875B2.) (6) A king orders his adviser to move a well. On the advice of his daughter, the adviser tells the king that the king must help by sending him the well. The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [H1023.25.1]. (Previously Type 875B3.) (7) The king asks a farmer for a tribute of calves born to bulls. The farmer?s son replies, ?Let me go and ask my father who is guarding the fields, lets fish come up from the seashore and eat the millet.? (Previously Type 875B4.) (8) Other impossible tasks that occur in some variants are: growing onions out of a stone, winding a rope of chaff [H1021.2] (cf. Type 1174), making a rope of sand [H1021] (cf. Type 1174), counting the leaves of the flowers or the stars in the sky, measuring the sky, sewing a millstone, drying snow on the stove [J2121, cf. Type 1270], drying a candle [J2122] (cf.

The king, impressed by his beauty, regrets that he cannot speak and promises a reward to whoever succeeds in making him talk again; failure will be punished by death. The princess comes disguised as a man (doctor). For three nights she tries in vain to cure him [H1194.0.1] and is finally led to the gallows. The boy (her husband), who is one of the spectators at her execution, speaks to her (in a very degrading way) at the very last moment and so saves her life. Cf. Types 434, 514, 514**, and 884.",NA,NA

Their healing power causes the dried-out bush to turn green or to bloom, or imparts fragrance to its flowers. (4) Having no where else to bathe Jesus, Mary washes him in certain natural springs, which then and ever after produce warm water. (5) Jesus soothes wolves, which aid the family in their flight.

Unable to ward them off, he prays to be hung in a chest from the ceiling. The mice go away. When the chest is taken down, the knight is found inside gnawed to death by other mice. Or, the Polish King Popiel flees from mice to a wooden tower on an island. Even there the mice find him and kill him. (2) A prominent cleric (Archbishop Hatto I or II) levies taxes during a famine and demands that those who do not pay (the poor) be burned to death. As they die, he likens their cries to the sound of squealing rats (mice). God punishes him for this cruel deed by plaguing him with mice. In order to get rid of the mice, the bishop flees to a tower on a rock in the Rhine (near Bingen). The mice attack him even there and eat him up."," Tale with legendary traits.

Cf. Types 756B, 756C. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) An angel ceases to appear to a hermit [Q553.2] because he spoke disparagingly of an evil-doer who was taken to the gallows. Thereupon the hermit has to do hard penance [L435.1] by wandering about as a beggar with a small dry branch [Q521.1]. The hermit converts a band of robbers with the story of his misfortune. The next morning the hermit is found dead, with green twigs on his small dry branch [F971.1] (2) A discontented hermit, an evil-doer, and a naked man covered with sand worry about their place in heaven. Angel Gabriel tells them God?s answers to their questions: the place of the hermit will be in hell because he doubts God?s justice, the evil-doer will be in heaven because of his hospitality, and even the sand will be removed from the naked man because of his ingratitude and impatience. (3) A criminal has to do penance after confession: every time he passes a crucifix he should say the Lord?s prayer. When doing so he is killed by the relative of one of his former victims. The hermit, his father confessor, sees that the criminal is taken into heaven by angels, and he decides to leave God?s service. When he leaves his cell, he breaks his neck and is taken by the devil. (4) A murderer overhears the confession of a dying hermit. In despair the criminal utters a fast prayer regretting not having lived a life like the pious hermit?s. The hermit hears the exclamation and as he dies, he behaves haughtily towards the criminal, whereupon his soul is taken by the devil. The criminal runs away, falls into a pit, and is taken into heaven by angels."," Four main versions of this tale have been described here, but clear assignments to the type are often difficult.",NA

When the boy becomes aware of this contract he first asks a priest, then a bishop, and finally the pope for advice. The boy wants to go to hell in order to dissolve the contract [F81.2], and the pope sends him to a hermit [N843]. The hermit directs him to his brother, a robber. The robber takes him to hell [H1235]. In hell the boy obtains his contract [H1273.1] (after many efforts to persuade the devil) and sees the fiery bed (chair) prepared for the robber [F771.1.9, J172, Q561]. In anticipating his punishments the robber decides (is told) to do penance [Q520.2] until his dry staff puts forth fresh blooms and fruit [Q521.1.1, Q521.1.2]. Assured of forgiveness, he dies happy and goes to heaven [Q172.3] (cf. Type 756C). The hermit is astonished but reconciles himself to God?s judgment (blasphemes God and is damned [Q312.3]).

In his despair he starts to regret his former haughtiness. Later, when he asks again for the sovereignty, he is accepted as emperor.

Or, a saint asks God for the reason for his decisions, an angel asks a saint (hermit) to accompany him to see God?s secret decisions, or, an angel and a hermit meet and decide to travel together. The angel (God?s messenger) forbids his companion to speak or to ask questions [C410, C411.1, C423.2, C491]. On their way the angel does many seemingly unjust and cruel things: he kills the child and/or the servant of a hospitable host and a man he meets in the street [J225.4, J225.5]; he repays hospitality by stealing a cup [J225.3], inhospitality by giving a cup (present); he repays an inhospitable person by constructing a house (rebuilding a fallen wall); he destroys the house (harvest) of hospitable people; he damages (sinks) a ship because of one sinner on board [J225.0.2, U21.3]; he kills the only cow of a poor woman; he offers good wishes to inhospitable people, and bad wishes to hospitable ones. Later the angel explains why each of these strange deeds was just. When the hermit sees the justification for each deed, he agrees that none of God?s acts should be blamed or doubted.

They have a strong dualistic tendency. Examples: (1) The creation of contrasting animals. The devil makes creatures in competition with God (often copies the creatures God made) [A1751]. (2) The devil tries to create humans but fails, and instead he creates certain animals [A1755, A1811, A1833.1, A1862, A1893]. For example, God makes Adam out of clay and the devil tries to copy him. He shapes the clay and blows life into it, but it turns into a monkey. In other variants, the devil makes inferior races of humans. (3) The good principle competes with the bad one, as God and the devil create various animals. God creates a wolf which is called ?God?s dog?, and the destructive devil deliberately creates goats [A63.4]. The devil?s animals devour God?s animals [A2286.2.1]. (4) The devil?s animals are brought to life by God [A1217]. The devil shapes some animals but only God (the name of God) can bring them to life. When the devil refuses to utter God?s name, the animals remain lifeless [A1756]. (5) God takes the devil?s animals. The devil creates (owns) animals that God wants for himself. God alters the appearance (colors) of the devil?s animals so that he cannot recognize them [A1750ff., K483]."," Early version in 16th century literature, e.g. Hans Sachs, Der dewffel hat die gais erschaffen, hat in dewffelaugen eingesetzt (1556).",NA

A man promises his wife (bride) that if she dies before him he will be buried with her [M254, S123.2] (to keep watch at her grave). She soon (after the wedding) dies. In the grave (at the grave-side) he sees a snake (weasel) revive another dead snake with a herb (three leaves, blade of grass) [B512, B491.1, D1500.1.4]. He revives his wife in the same manner [E165]. His wife then falls in love with another man (ship?s captain) [K2213.5] and, together with her new lover, she throws her husband into the sea [K2213.2, S142]. Or, she leaves her husband and by a ruse causes him to be condemned to death (as a thief). A faithful servant [P361] (friend, his mother) resuscitates him with the snake-leaves [E105]. The guilty pair is exposed and punished [Q261]. In some Indian variants, a god permits a man to resuscitate his wife by giving her half of his own lifespan. She falls in love with another man and tries to kill her husband. He is rescued and asks his wife to return the given years he gave her. She dies for a second time.

She returns at night to suckle her child [E323.1.1, D688] and to look after her brother. A servant overhears the conversation between the animal brother and the sister and informs the prince [H13]. The false bride and her mother are punished. Cf. Type 403. In some variants the false bride and her mother want to kill the animal brother because they fear that the truth will be discovered.

A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers [P253.0.5, P251.6.7, Z71.5.1] who had been transformed into animals (birds) [P253.2]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans [D161.1] (ravens [D151.5]). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years [D758] and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers [D753.1]. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her [N711]. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child [K2116.1.1] (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Everything is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars [H1232]. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born [S272]. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign [T595], but the wrong sign is sent [N344.1], so the brothers leave home [S272.1]."," Early version see Johannes de Alta Silva, Dolopathos (No. 7)."," 403, 408, 450, 706, 707, and 709."

He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C.

The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives together with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1].

On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235]. She arrives (sometimes by climbing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegroom?s far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.)for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a soporific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride [D2006.1.4].

(Including the previous Types 425J, 425N, and 428.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Type 425A. Introductory episodes: A young woman marries a supernatural bridegroom: (1) She is given to her bridegroom because of a present that she has asked her father to bring back from a journey [S228]. (2) The bridegroom performs a set of difficult tasks. (3) She pulls up an herb and discovers the bridegroom?s subterranean castle (a wind carries her there). (4) She finds him in another way. The bridegroom is the son of a witch (ogress) or he is (during the day) an animal [D621.1]. Main part: The young woman breaks the bridegroom`s prohibition (cf. Typ 425A), and he goes away [C932]. (Before he leaves, he gives her a token, e.g. ring, feather.) (In iron shoes) she sets out to find him [H1385.4, H1125]. The bride comes to the house of her bridegroom?s mother, a witch, who swears by her son?s name not to devour her. The witch imposes difficult tasks on the young woman, which she performs (with the help of her bridegroom): to sort a large quantity of grain [H1122], to fill mattresses with the feathers of all kinds of birds, to wash the black wool white and the white black [H1023.6, cf. Type 1183], to sweep a house but leave it unswept [H1066], etc. In some variants she enchants (three) suitors and makes them fight (part of previous Type 425N). Cf. Types 313, 875. The young woman is sent on a dangerous journey to bring a casket from the sister of the witch. Having passed obstacles (with the advice from her bridegroom) and obtained the casket, she is forbidden to open it. (Cf. Types 408, 480.) When the bride acts against the prohibition, her husband helps her. At the wedding of the bridegroom and the witch?s daughter, the young woman has to hold ten burning candles (torches). Her bridegroom saves her from being burned. The young woman remarries her bridegroom, or both escape by a magic (transformation) flight [D671, D672]. In some variants a female demon (witch) demands that a young woman accomplish impossible tasks [G204, H1010, H931]. Among other things, the girl has to bring a letter to another demon telling her to kill the girl [K978] (cf. Type 930). A wolf helps the girl to escape the danger [B435.3]. As a reward, the wolf is disenchanted. He turns to a prince [D113.1] and marries the young woman. (Previously Type 428.)"," The earliest literary version is by Apuleius, Cupid and Psyche, in Metamorphoses (IV,28?VI,24), ca. 100 C.E. Many structural similarities exist between Types 425A and 425B, and often the variants are not clearly identified as belonging to one type or the other. The essential feature of this type is the quest for the casket, which entails the visit to the second witch?s house. Usually the supernatural bridegroom is the witch?s son, and he helps his wife perform the tasks. According to Swahn (1955), the previous Type 428 is a fragment of Type 425B."," 425A, 425C, 425E, 433B, and 857."

A merchant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back presents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes, the youngest a rose [L221]. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute [S222].

The two older girls cook and make a bed only for the man, not for the animals, nor do they wait for the old man to go to bed before they do [Q2]. He shuts them up in his cellar. The youngest girl takes care of the animals, feeds them [L54] and takes the leftovers for herself, and goes to bed only after the old man is settled down for the night. She wakes up in a palace. Instead of the old man, she finds a young prince, who, together with his three servants, had been enchanted by a witch. The girl and the prince marry [L162], and the sisters must serve as maids until they prove themselves to be sympathetic to animals. In some variants a woman spoils her lazy, bad-tempered daughter and mistreats the industrious stepsister, giving her only a little food. She follows a rolling loaf of bread to a (enchanted) house in the forest. She shares her food with animals who live there (whom she has brought with her) and is kind to an old man or an animal-man (forest spirit). On the advice of the animals, she takes the man to bed with her, and he is disenchanted (along with the animals) [D731]. She marries the man or is given a reward. The jealous sister comes to the house with good food, but does not share it with the animals, so they do not give her advice. She is unkind to the old man (spirit) and is (severely) punished. Cf.

Cf. Type 430. This tale deals with a brave woman who marries a snake (worm, frog or toad, lizard, another animal). She disenchants him by kissing or embracing him or by sharing his bed [D735.1], or because she wears more shirts than he has layers of skin. (Previously Types 433 and 433A.) Cf. Types 425A, 441, 480, 711. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor woman gives birth to a snake (a couple adopt a snake or a frog as their child). When the animal grows up he wants to marry the daughter of the king. The king sets impossible tasks, which the snake accomplishes (the snake frightens the king). The snake marries the princess, and after the wedding he turns into a handsome man (prince). (2) A childless queen (through a hasty wish [T513] or magic conception [T510]) gives birth to an animal son (snake, dragon, etc.) whom she keeps secret. When he grows up he wants to marry, but every woman who marries him is killed on her wedding night. One courageous young woman (a mistreated stepdaughter) puts on seven shirts one on top of the other (on the advice of a wise woman, her dead mother). She challenges the snake to shed one of his skins every time she takes off one of her shirts. When he is completely stripped, she whips him and then bathes him in milk [D766.1]. She lies down beside him and he turns into a handsome young man. (The skins are destroyed [D721.3].) (3) A young woman marries a snake who gives her jewelry and turns into a handsome young man. The woman burns the snake skin and lives happily with her husband. Another jealous woman tells her father she too wants to marry a snake. She is left in a room alone with such an animal, who kills her. (Previously Type 433C.) In some variants after the husband is disenchanted, the woman is (slandered by a jealous woman and) banished. She disenchants a prince (who has been transformed into a bird) or a dead man, marries him, and gives birth to a son. Her first husband finds her after a long search. She must choose between the husbands and decides to stay with the first."," The earliest European versions are the verse novella Asinarius of ca. 1200 (cf.

Another sorceress recognizes that the dog is really a human and returns him to his original form. With her help the husband is able to turn his wife into a mare and he beats her (to death). (2) An unfaithful wife turns her husband into a dog [D141, K1535], which herds sheep and also rescues the king?s baby [D682.3]. When he returns to his wife, she turns him into a bird [D151.8]. He finds a magic wand, becomes a man again, and changes his wife and her lover into donkeys [D682.3]."," Version (1) is traced to the Arabian Nights. Version (2) is thought to be a folktale from Syria that has spread to eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus.

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) unwittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil [S240]. When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic [K218.2] (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture [D758.1]. They marry [F302, L161]. When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home [D1470.1.15], and she forbids him to call her to come to him [C31.6] (to boast of her beauty [C31.5]). At home he is induced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears [D2074.2.3.1], takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife [H1385.3]. On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions [B221, H1232, H1235]. With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic objects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword [D1400.1.4], magic coat or hood [D1361.14], seven-league boots [D1521.1]) [D831, D832] (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife [D2121]. When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man [N681]. He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She appears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her husband into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened [D1364.15, D1364.4.1, D1972]. The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her ( on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens [D361.1]. While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth [D721.2, B652.1]. Later, because of carelessness (of the man?s mother), the maiden takes back her coat [D361.1.1] and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass mountain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight).",NA," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 302, 313, 402, 518, 554, 810, and 936*, and also 300, 301, 303, 304, 314, 325, 326, 329, 402, 425, 465, 505, 516, 530, 531, 550, 552, 566, 569, 590, 707, and 1159."

A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful [D759.9]. The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed. In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the princesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) [D759.10].",NA,NA

A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapitation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog?s skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf.

A stepmother hates her stepchildren [S31]. The stepdaughter is kind to someone she meets (e.g. Christ and St. Peter) (she is sent after strawberries in winter [H1023.3], and meets dwarfs who help her). In return she is given great beauty [D1860] (the power of dropping gold or jewels from her mouth [D1454.2, D1454.1.2]). The stepmother?s own daughter is unkind under these conditions and is made ugly [D1870] (made to drop toads from her mouth [M431.2]) [Q2]. The stepdaughter?s brother is in service at the court of a king. He takes his sister?s picture with him.

On their journey to the king?s court, the stepmother or stepsister casts the true bride out of the carriage (overboard) [S432]. The king marries the ugly stepsister [K1911], and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes [Q465.1]. (The king?s wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride [K1911.1.2].) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) [D161.2], and comes to the king?s court three times (to care for her child [D688]). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation [D711] (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive transformations [D712.4]). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes [B848], is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished [Q261]. Cf.

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her predestined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (sometimes her vegetable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fianc?e) signals the girl to come. She appears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Previously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her.

She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) [S375]. The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.)[D721.5]. The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own [J1791.6.1], and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girl?s place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is astonished at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water [K1911.2.2], where she changes into a fish [D170] (bird [D150]). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) [D610]. Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old woman?s housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) [K1911.3]. (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove [D150] and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the bird?s song asking about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl [K1911.3]. Cf. Type 452B*.

He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the current year, the king?s daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dragon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978.2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragon?s heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragon?s heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wedding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the king?s table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon-slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragon?s tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf.

After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511.5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601]. While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six- [B11.2.3.3], twelve- [B11.2.3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like), the animal son overhears the conversations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], defeats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragon?s mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10.3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragon?s mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragon?s mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men.

This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.)steals golden apples from the king?s garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youngest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the entrance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses? help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treacherous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again.",NA," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 302, 313, 400, 550, 650A, and also 300A, 303, 304, 312D, 314, 327B, 400, 402, 506, 513A, 516, 530, 1060, 1088, 1115, and 1910."

The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier [L161]. Cf. Types 301, 505.",NA,NA

After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grateful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three princesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (?Red Knight?) who pretended to be the princess?s rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea monster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them.

He (stops time and) meets giants (robbers, supernatural beings) whom he impresses by shooting tricks [F666.1] or by his extraordinary physical strength. The giants go to plunder a castle (town) or to carry off a princess, and take the youth with them.

This tale exists chiefly in four different forms (cf. Types 314, 551, 673): (1) A king falls ill and learns that he can only be cured by the milk and blood of a dragon?s heart. He promises his oldest daughter to whoever is able to get the remedy, and his youngest daughter to whoever assists. A nobleman and a farmer boy set out and, with the help of an old woman, arrive at the dragon?s forest. The farmer boy kills the dragon, squeezes milk and blood out of its heart, and hides them. Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragon?s heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom [K1935]. The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragon?s heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragon?s liver. He sees the dragon?s vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the man?s knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the king?s court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devil?s tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devil?s tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons? eyes, a dragon?s heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way. The cure is successful, and the prince marries the young woman."," The four versions represent oicotypes: Version (1) ? Danish, version (2) ? Flemish, version (3) ? Latvian, version (4) ?

This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the ?Magic Flight? and the ?Forgotten Fianc?e?. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the man?s unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222, S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threatening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demon?s daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her father?s house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the prince?s blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Nevertheless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fianc? into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.)which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad stepmother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fianc?e [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the bride?s warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus forgets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fianc?e reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husband?s new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006.1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride.",NA," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 222B, 300, 301, 302, 303, 303A, 310, 311, 312, 314, 315, 325, 327A, 327B, 329, 400, 402, 408, 425, 450, 480, 502, 511, 518, 531, 537, 552, 563, 707, 884, 1115, and 1119."

This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 314A, 502, and 530. Introductory episodes: (1) A boy has been promised (often in return for magic conception) to a demon (devil, giant) [S211], or he voluntarily becomes a servant in a demon?s house [G462]. The demon orders him to care for two (groups of) animals, to feed the one and to neglect the other. The boy does not follow these instructions and thus makes friends with the abused animal (magic horse) [B316]. Against the prohibition of the demon, he enters a certain chamber [C611]. As a mark of disobedience, his hair turns gold [C912]. The boy and the magic horse escape from the demon by a magic flight [D672]. (2) A boy (usually the son of a ruler) and a magic foal are close friends. The mother (stepmother) wants to kill the boy. The magic foal warns the boy of her secret murderous attempts. At last the mother demands that the boy or the foal be killed. The boy pretends to agree but asks his father to be allowed to ride the foal one last time. During this ride the foal flies away together with the boy [B184.1.6]. (3) In return for his magic conception, a boy is promised to a demon [G461]. On the way to the demon?s house, the boy is forewarned (given instructions for how to kill the demon or to flee). In the rooms of the demon?s house, the boy finds prisoners or corpses (and his hair turns to gold [C912]). The boy kills the demon and flees. Main part: The youth covers his golden hair, pretending to be a scaldhead, and takes service in the king?s court as a gardener [K1816.1]. (He says nothing except, ?I don?t know.? [C495.1]; previously Type 532). But the youngest princess sees him in his true form ( as a golden-haired knight who destroys and restores the garden three times) [H75.4]. She falls in love with Goldener [T91.6.4] and chooses him as her husband by throwing a golden apple to him [T55.1]. They marry but the angry king banishes the couple to a shabby lodging [L132, L113.1.0.1]. The king demands the help of his sons-in-law. Goldener has only a poor kit and is mocked. With the help of his magic horse he achieves various heroic deeds: He obtains the magic remedy (e.g. milk of a bird, water of life) for the king who had grown blind (cf. Type 551), kills a dragon (cf. Type 300), defeats a foreign army three times in disguise. He is wounded and is bandaged by the king. Three times he withdraws and is mocked as a fool. Cf. Type 530. Goldener?s identity is revealed (e.g. by wounds, brands) and his true status is recognized [H55, H56]. The horse asks to be decapitated and becomes a prince (princess, other person)."," Because of its similar structure and content, Type 532 is included here."," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 217, 300?303A, 313, 314A, 315, 321, 325, 327, 327B, 400, 441, 475, 502, 511, 530, 530A, 531, 550, 552A, 551, 554, 590, 613, 725, 1049, 1052, and 1060."

The brother kills a number of robbers (devils, giants, dragons) but does not realize that the last one is merely wounded [F615]. The sister helps the wounded robber to recover, and he becomes her lover. In order to get rid of the brother, she pretends to be ill and sends him out to get her the milk (liver) of dangerous animals [K2212.0.2].

After the first attempt fails, the sister binds her brother with a silk thread, or she sends him to a magic mill where the animals are kept. When the couple is about to kill the brother, he whistles for the animals. They (break out from the mill and) tear the robber to pieces.

He is cured by a supernatural being and is able to return to his wife.

Using these objects, he helps a king to be victorious and, in return, marries a princess. The princess has a lover [T232]. She persuades her husband to give her the magic objects (exchanges them) [K2213]. The husband is killed and, as he had requested, his dismembered body is loaded on his horse and carried to the serpent?s castle. The dead youth is resuscitated (by the serpent) and given the power of self-transformation. As a horse with a golden mane he is sold to the king. The princess recognizes the horse as her former husband and orders that it be killed. (On his advice) a maidservant catches drops of its blood which turn into a tree with golden apples. The princess recognizes the tree as her former husband, and orders that it be felled. (On his advice) the maidservant throws a chip into a pond, where it turns into a golden drake [D610].

In order for the son to be released at the end of the apprenticeship, the father has to recognize him [H62.1, H161]. The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magician?s influence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tormented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.)and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, transformed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princess?s lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground. The magician as a rooster is about to eat the corn, but the youth becomes a fox and bites off the rooster?s head [L142.2]. He marries the princess."," Parts of the tale can be found in Ovid?s Metamorphoses (VIII,871?875).

A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall always win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free.

A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his newborn son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike [Z111, J486].

Thus the man becomes a famous doctor and grows wealthy.

God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beech-trees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms.

(Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called ?Red Riding Hood? because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path [J21.5]. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother?s house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears [Z18.1], eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood [K2011]. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive [F913]. They fill the wolf?s belly with stones [Q426]; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother?s house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girl?s mother).

One introductory episode is combined with various main parts in which a man wins a princess and a castle. The ending is also very similar. Introductory episode: While traveling, a man sees a corpse which is not allowed to be buried or is ill-treated by its creditors [Q271.1]. He uses all his money to pay the debts of the dead man and for his funeral. Later he meets the grateful dead man in the form of a traveling companion (old man, servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 507. Main parts: (1) The man ransoms a princess, who had been kidnapped, from slavery and marries her [R111.1.6, L161]. While the man is away in another country, the father of the princess recognizes the sail of the ship which is emboidered with the princess? coat of arms and learns that his daughter is alive. When the man goes back to fetch his wife, he finds that she has been abducted by one of her father?s courtiers. The man searches for his wife, and the traveling companion helps him to return to his father-in-law?s court [R163]. There the man discloses his identity as the husband of the princess and gets his bride back. (Previously Type 506A.) (2) The man rescues a young woman from robbers. On their way home by ship the man is thrown overboard by a rival [S142] but is rescued by the traveling companion [R163] and brought to the princess. He is recognized by means of a ring or otherwise [H94.4, H11.1]. The rival is unmasked and punished. (Previously Type 506B.) (3) The traveling companion equips the man with a magnificent horse. A tournament takes place in which the winner is to marry a princess [H972, H331.2]. The man wins her. (Previously Type 508.) Ending: The traveling companion asks for his part of the winnings and wants to divide the princess (their baby) [M241.1]. When the man, trying to save the princess, offers the whole kingdom, the traveling companion reveals himself as the grateful dead man, says his demand was only a test of faith, and vanishes. In some variants the grateful dead man is a saint, who helps the hero because he has redeemed a saint?s picture that was mistreated [N848.1].

This type consists of one introductory part and two different main parts. The ending is often the same. Introductory part: While traveling a young man provides a suitable funeral for an unknown man whose corpse was mistreated by creditors [Q271.1]. Later he meets a traveling companion (servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 505. On their way, the traveling companion obtains (three) magic objects (e.g. boots, magic hood, cloak, sabre, feather). The young man woos a princess who is in love with a magician (ogre, devil). Her suitors have to guess her thoughts three times (bring hidden objects [H322.1], solve difficult tasks). If they fail they are executed. Main part: (1) With the help of the magic objects, the companion of the young man becomes invisible and follows the princess on her way to the magician. There he finds the solutions [H972]. He frees the princess by beating, burning, or killing the magician [T172.2.1]. On the wedding night the young man has to submerge the princess (in different forms) three times in a bath to release her from her enchantment [D766.1]. (Previously Type 507A.) Cf. Type 306. (2) All bridegrooms of a princess have perished during the bridal night [T172.0.1]. The young man marries her on advice of his companion. A snake (snakes) comes into the chamber or crawls out of the princess? mouth to kill the young man, but the companion kills it. (Previously Types 507B, 507C.) Cf. Types 840, 1145. Ending: (After a year) the companion demands his half of the winnings and divides the princess in two parts. Snakes crawl out of her body. He puts the halves together and the princess is disenchanted forever. In a few variants the companion only pretents to divide the princess [M241.1] to test the faith of the young man, and then discloses his identity as the grateful dead man. Cf.

A king promises his wife on her deathbed [M255] only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a particular ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condition, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father [T311.1] and, disguised in the ugly skin [K521.1, F821.1.3, F821.1.4], works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her [N711.6] but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid [R255]. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid badly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid [H151.5]. He gives her a ring. Then the prince becomes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her [H94.2, H94.4] and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token.", This form of the incest motif (the king wants to marry his daughter after the death of his wife) is often documented independently since the 12th century.," 403, 510A, 511, 706, and 923."

A girl (boy) has a stepmother who does not give her enough to eat but makes her herd cattle and spin a great amount of flax. She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, godmother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (intestines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the stepsisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and stepsisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsister discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these overcomes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girl?s father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals. A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother.

Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army.

The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husband?s anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in man?s clothing [K1837] accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in man?s clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the ?servant/husband?, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A?513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the ?servant,? which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in man?s clothing is transformed into a man. This happens either through a demon?s curse [D11] or a saint?s help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son."," Great variety of motifs in different episodes.

A faithful servant (adoptive brother, a dead man whom he has redeemed [P361, P311, P273.1]) helps him in this pursuit.

The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food [H1515] (drink, clothing [H1516]), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night [T172.2]. When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the bride?s breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death [N342.1]. Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself [C423.4] and is turned to stone step by step [C961.2]. The prince and his wife mourn the helper.

When they arrive, the helper storms the woman?s defenses, slays her army, and overcomes the woman herself on his master?s behalf [Z3]. He defeats her in single combat (using a cloak of invisibility): e.g. in a shooting contest with a giant bow [H345.1], in breaking her wild horse [H345.2] [F601.2, H345]. On the wedding night the strong woman tries to crush the prince [T173.1]. The helper secretly takes his master?s place and beats her for three nights with whips made of three kinds of metal [K1844.1]. When the woman discovers the impersonation, she orders the feet of the helper to be cut off [Q451.2, S162] and banishes the prince to the pigsty [K1816.6]. The helper finds a blind companion and together they force a demon to heal them with Water of Life [D1500.1.18]. The helper returns, overcomes (kills) the strong woman, and rescues the prince [R169.4]. 530?559 Animals as Helpers"," The figure of the strong woman is often documented in epic poems and heroic songs, e.g. in the ancient Greek myth of the Amazons and in the Nibelungenlied with Brunhilde."," 300A, 303, and 315."

A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The king?s daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2] In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess summons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the king?s household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses). Cf. Types 313, 314, 314A."," Many narratives classified as Type 530 in the catalogs have only the introduction of the type, and in some the motif of the glass mountain plays only a marginal part."," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 314, and also 300, 301, 302, 313, 314, 314A, 400, 502, 530A, 531, 550, 551, and 675."

This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, ?The Godchild of the King und the Unfaithful Companion?, ?The Golden-haired Maiden?, and ?The Clever Horse?. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horse?s advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beardless man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the king?s court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boy?s companion) slanders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boiling milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, rejuvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328."," Classical origin for some motifs.

Her mother orders a maidservant to accompany her, and gives her a small rag with some drops of her mother?s blood to protect her and sends a speaking horse to take care of her. When during the journey the princess loses her mother?s charm, the waiting-maid gains control of the princess [K2252, K1911.1.1], forces her to change clothes and roles [K1934], and to swear an oath of secrecy [K1933]. The prince unwittingly marries the maidservant, and the real princess is employed as a goose-girl [K1816.5]. When the false wife orders the horse to be killed [B335], the princess persuades a farmhand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it answers regretting the injury that is being done to her [D1011, B133.3]. When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a goose-boy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he complains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove [H13.2.7] (her dog [H13.1.2]) (cf. Types 870, 894).

Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the king?s tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a golden bird [B102.1] and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331.1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there nevertheless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird [L13, B313, B560, H1233.6]. Against the fox?s advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184.1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (princess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the fox?s help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the fox?s advice he releases his brothers from the gallows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who rescued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the bird?s singing. Cf. Type 551."," This type occurs often in combination with Type 551, so many variants cannot be assigned to one or the other."," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 301, 314, 531, 551, 780, and also 302, 303, 303A, 304, 329, 400, 461, 505, 513, 516, 530, and 707."

Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She arrives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accompany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The youngest brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened."," This type occurs often in combination with Type 550, so many variants cannot be assigned to one or the other."," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 314, 531, 780, and also 300, 301, 313, 314, 505, 530, 550, 554, 567, 590, and 968."

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers? advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three animal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry any one even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls? father visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically provided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragically). (Previously Type 552B.)"," Important version see Basile, Pentamerone (IV,3). The type occurs in two forms, but many variants are not clearly differentiated. The second form occurs mainly in northern Europe and is less widespread."," 302, 302C*, 303A, 317, 400, 425A, 425C, 518, 554, and 560."

This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with helpful deeds of grateful animals. In numerous tales the type occurs only as episode. Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he prevents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and carelessness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc.",NA," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 300, 302, 400, 531, and also 303, 313, 314, 317, 329, 402, 465, 513A, 513B, 551, 552, 552A, 556F*, 560, 570, 610, 613, 667, and 673."

A father leaves his wealth to his three sons. One of them steals diamonds (pieces of gold) that had been willed to all three brothers. In order to settle the case they consult a wise man. On their way they see tracks of an animal and make the following deductions [J1661.1]: It was a camel (horse, pack-animal), it was one-eyed (grass is eaten on one side of the road only) [J1661.1.1], it was lame (because of its tracks), it was carrying oil or honey, etc. (drops are seen on the ground), it had no tail (dung on a heap instead of being spread by the tail), etc. When they meet the owner of the lost animal he overhears their remarks, takes them for thieves, and brings them to the judge. They explain their observations to the judge and are absolved. When they are invited for dinner (by the judge) they say the meat is dogmeat [F647.5.1], the wine (bread) smells like a corpse [F647.1], and their host is a bastard [J1661.1.2]. On investigation all their statements are found to be true. The animal had been suckled by a bitch, the vine (corn) had grown on a cemetery, and the mother (of the judge) confesses her adultery.

A girl is mistreated by her stepmother [S31] and has to work very hard [H934.3]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle [N777.4]) [N777.2, N791]. She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head [H935, Q41.2, G466]. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she choses the plain one [L211]. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped [N777]), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc. [H1226]). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken [D1658.1.5]. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks [G204, H935]: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon [G466], has to comb the hair of fairies [H1192], has to carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] or wash black wool white [H1023.6]. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded [Q41] with gold, jewels, etc. , becomes more beautiful [D1860], or jewels fall from her mouth [D1454.2]. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room [C611]. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals [B350], objects [D1658], and people of her outward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth [M431.2], horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince. Cf. Types 431, 480A, and 1180.", Elements of the tale are documented in 1595 in the comedy The Old Wives? Tale by G. Peele.," This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 403, 510A, and also 313, 408, 428, 431, 510, 511, 511A, and 709."
