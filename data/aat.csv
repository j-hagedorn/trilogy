Advice Well Taken,0910b,The Prince Who Acquired Wisdom,"""What do you want with wise men?"" asked the plowman. The prince said that he was traveling to get wisdom. The plowman said that he would give him instruction if he were paid. Then the prince promised to give him one gold piece for each piece of wisdom. The plowman agreed and said. ""Listen attentively! My first maxim is this: You are the son of a raja; whenever you go to visit a friend or one of your subjects and they offer you a bedstead, or stool, or mat to sit on, do not sit down at once but move the stool or mat a little to one side; this is one maxim: give me my gold coin."" So the prince paid him. Then the plowman said, ""The second maxim is this: You are the son of a raja; whenever you go to bathe, do not bathe at the common bathing place, but at a place by yourself; give me my coin,"" and the prince did so. Then he continued, "" My third maxim is this: You are the son of a raja; when men come to you for advice or to have a dispute decided, listen to what the majority of those present say and do not follow your own fancy, now pay me;"" and the prince gave him his last gold coin, and said that he had no more. ""Well,"" said the plowman, ""Your lesson is finished, but still I will give you one more piece of advice free and it is this: You are the son of a raja; restrain your anger, if anything you see or hear makes you angry, still do not at once take action; hear the explanation and weigh it well, then if you find cause you can give rein to your anger and if not, let the offender off!"" After this the prince set his face homewards as he had spent all his money; and he began to repent of having spent his gold pieces on advice that seemed worthless. However on his way he turned into a bazaar to buy some food and the shopkeepers on all sides called out, ""Buy, buy,"" so he went to a shop and the shopkeeper invited him to sit on a rug; he was just about to do so when he remembered the maxim of his instructor and pulled the rug to one side; and when he did so he saw that it had been spread over the mouth of a well and that if he had sat on it he would have been killed; so he began to believe in the wisdom of his teacher. Then he went on his way and on the road he turned aside to a tank to bathe, and remembering the maxim of his teacher he did not bathe at the common place but went to a place apart; then having eaten his lunch he continued his journey, but he had not gone far when he found that he had left his purse behind, so he turned back and found it lying at the place where he had put down his things when he bathed; thereupon he applauded the wisdom of his teacher, for if he had bathed at the common bathing place, someone would have seen the purse and have taken it away. When evening came on he turned into a village and asked the headman to let him sleep in his verandah, and there was already one other traveler sleeping there and in the morning it was found that the traveler had died in his sleep. Then the headman consulted the villagers and they decided that there was nothing to be done but to throw away the body, and that as the prince was also a traveler he should do it. At first he refused to touch the corpse as he was the son of a raja, but the villagers insisted and then he bethought himself of the maxim that he should not act contrary to the general opinion; so he yielded and dragged away the body, and threw it into a ravine. Before leaving it he remembered that it was proper to remove the clothes, and when he began to do so he found round the waist of the body a roll of coin; so he took this and was glad that he had followed the advice of his teacher. That evening he reached the boundary of his own territory and decided to press on home although it was dark; at midnight he reached the palace and without arousing anyone went to the door of his wife's room. Outside the door he saw a pair of shoes and a sword; at the sight he became wild with rage and drawing the sword he called out, ""Who is in my room?"" As a matter of fact the prince's wife had got the prince's little sister to sleep with her, and when the girl heard the prince's voice she got up to leave; but when she opened the door and saw the prince standing with the drawn sword she drew back in fear; she told him who she was and explained that they had put the shoes and sword at the door to prevent anyone else from entering; but in his wrath the prince would not listen and called to her to come out and be killed. Then she took off her cloth and showed it to him through the crack of the door and at the sight of this he was convinced; then he reflected on the advice of his teacher and repented, because he had nearly killed his sister through not restraining his wrath.

Advice Well Taken,0910b,The Highlander Takes Three Advices from the English Farmer,"Their separation was painful; but they comforted themselves with the promise to be true to each other, and to meet again in better circumstances. The husband had an aversion to become a soldier; so he sailed to Greenock, and from thence made his way into England, and traveled on until he met with a worthy farmer, with whom he agreed to work. The bargain was made by signs, for the highlander had no English; but after a time they came to understand each other quite well, and the highlander learned a little English. His master respected his servant very much; and the servant was steady, honest, and industrious in his service. Time passed on, year after year; and every year the highlander left his wages in his master's hands, until he had a pretty round sum to take. At length he prepared to return home to Cantire; and his master laid down all his wages on the table, and said, ""Whether will you lift all your money, or take three advices in its place?"" The highlander replied, ""Sir, your advices were always good to me, and I think it better to take them than to lift the money."" So the master took away the money, and gave him these three advices: II. Lodge not in any house in which you see an old man and his young wife. III. Do nothing rashly until you have well considered what you will do. After traveling several miles the highlander overtook a peddler, who was on his way to Scotland; so they agreed to keep company with one another, and to lodge at a certain town that same night: but as they were traveling quite agreeably, they came upon a by-way which was a great length shorter than the high road, and the peddler proposed that they should take it; but the highlander would not, for he thought of his master's first advice. Then the peddler said that he was tired with his burthen, and that he would take the short by-way, and wait until his companion had come forward. So they went each their way, and the highlander kept to the high-way until he had come to the place appointed. There he found the peddler weeping, and without his pack, for he had been robbed in the by-way. So this was the benefit that the highlander got by following the first advice of the English farmer. Then they walked on together to the town, the peddler weeping for the loss of his pack, and saying that he knew where they would get good lodgings. But, when they got to the house, the highlander saw an old man and a young wife; so he would not lodge there, for he remembered his master's second advice. But the peddler remained in the house, and the highlander crept into a coal-house in the entry. At midnight he felt some one coming in at the door, and, after remaining a short time, going out again; but, as he passed him in the dark, the highlander, with his knife, cut a bit from the wing of his coat, and kept it. In the morning the cry of murder was heard, and it was found that the old man who kept the house had been killed. The authorities of the town came and saw the dead body, and found the peddler sleeping in a room; and when they searched his pockets, there was a bloody knife found in them; and as he had no pack or money, they concluded he was a false peddler, and had murdered the old man to get his wealth. So the peddler was apprehended and condemned to be hanged; and the highlander accompanied him to the scaffold, and observed among the crowd a young man walking with the young wife of the murdered man; and the young man's coat was of the same color as the swatch he had cut from it in the coal-house in the entry. ""Hang me!"" said the highlander, ""if you pair are not the murderers."" So they were apprehended, and acknowledged their crime, and were hanged; and the peddler was set at liberty. And this was the benefit that was got from the High lander following the second advice of the English farmer. It was midnight when the highlander got back home. He rapped at the door, and his wife got up, and recognized her husband, and lighted a candle. Upon that, the highlander saw a fine young man lying in the bed; and he was purposing to step up and kill him, apprehensive that another had taken his place. But he thought on his master's advice, and said, ""Who is yon man?"" ""It is our son!"" said his wife. ""He came home from his service last evening, and slept in that bed."" ""I should have slain him but for the master!"" said the highlander. So this was the benefit he got from following the third advice of the English farmer. The highlander's joy was now at its height. His son arose from the bed; more peats were put on, and a large fire kindled; and the highlander then sought a knife to cut the loaf that he had carried all the way from England. With the first slice he found silver money; and when he had cut all the loaf, he found therein all the wages that would have been paid him by his master. So the highlander got the money and the three advices also; and with the money he stocked a farm and lived comfortably till the end of his days.",Scotland,"Source: Cuthbert Bede [pseudonym for Edward Bradley], The White Wife: With Other Stories, Supernatural, Romantic, and Legendary (London: Sampson Low, Son, and Marston, 1865), pp. 141-46.",NA,NA
Advice Well Taken,0910b,The Three Admonitions,"He said to the abbot, ""Sir, I have served you thus long, but now I wish to return to my country."" ""Yes, my son,"" said the abbot, "" but before departing I must give you the three hundred ounces [nearly 13 francs] that I have put together for you. Will you be satisfied with three admonitions, or with the three hundred ounces?"" The servant answered, ""I will be satisfied with the three admonitions."" ""Then listen. First: When you change the old road for the new, you will find troubles which you have not looked for. Second: See much and say little. Third: Think over a thing before you do it, for a thing deliberated is very fine. Take this loaf of bread and break it when you are truly happy."" The good man departed, and on his journey met other travelers. These said to him, ""We are going to take the by-way. Will you come with us?"" But he remembering the three admonitions of his master answered, ""No, my friends, I will keep on this road."" When he had gone half way, bang! bang! he heard some shots. ""What was that, my sons?"" The robbers had killed his companions. ""I have gained the first hundred ounces!"" he said, and continued his journey. On his way he arrived at an inn as hungry as a dog and called for something to eat. A large dish of meat was brought which seemed to say, ""Eat me, eat me!"" He stuck his fork in it and turned it over, and was frightened out of his wits, for it was human flesh! He wanted to ask the meaning of such food and give the innkeeper a lecture, but just then he thought, ""See much and say little;"" so he remained silent. The innkeeper came, he settled his bill, and took leave. But the innkeeper stopped him and said, ""Bravo, bravo! you have saved your life. All those who have questioned me about my food have been soundly beaten, killed, and nicely cooked."" ""I have gained the second hundred ounces,"" said the good man, who did not think his skin was safe until then. When he reached his own country he remembered his house, saw the door ajar and slipped in. He looked about and saw no one, only in the middle of the room was a table, well set with two glasses, two forks, two seats, service for two. ""How is this?"" he said. ""I left my wife alone and here I find things arranged for two. There is some trouble."" So he hid himself under the bed to see what went on. A moment after he saw his wife enter, who had gone out a short time before for a pitcher of water. A little after he saw a sprucely dressed young priest come in and seat himself at the table. ""Ah, is that he?"" and he was on the point of coming forth and giving him a sound beating; but there came to his mind the final admonition of the abbot: ""Think over a thing before you do it, for a thing deliberated is very fine;"" and he refrained. He saw them both sit down at the table, but before eating his wife turned to the young priest and said: ""My son, let us say our accustomed Paternoster for your father."" When he heard this he came from under the bed crying and laughing for joy, and embraced and kissed them both so that it was affecting to see him. Then he remembered the loaf his master had given him and told him to eat in his happiness; he broke the loaf and there fell on the table all the three hundred ounces, which the master had secretly put in the loaf.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales, (London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 41, pp. 157-59.",NA,NA
Advice Well Taken,0910b,The Three Advices,"There once came, what of late has happened so often in Ireland, a hard year. When the crops failed, there was beggary and misfortune from one end of the island to the other. At that time many poor people had to quit the country from want of employment, and through the high price of provisions. Among others, John Carson was under the necessity of going over to England, to try if he could get work; and of leaving his wife and family behind him, begging for a bite and a sup up and down, and trusting to the charity of good Christians. John was a smart young fellow, handy at any work, from the hay field to the stable, and willing to earn the bread he ate; and he was soon engaged by a gentleman. The English are mighty strict upon Irish servants; he was to have twelve guineas a year wages, but the money was not to be paid until the end of the year, and he was to forfeit the entire twelve guineas in the lump, if he misconducted himself in any way within the twelve months. John Carson was to be sure upon his best behavior, and conducted himself in every particular so well for the whole time, there was no faulting him late or early, and the wages were fairly his. The term of his agreement being expired, he determined on returning home, notwithstanding his master, who had a great regard for him, pressed him to remain, and asked him if he had any reason to be dissatisfied with his treatment. ""No reason in life, sir,"" said John; ""you've been a good master and a kind master to me; the Lord spare you over your family; but I left a wife and two small children of my own at home, after me in Ireland, and your honor would never wish to keep me from them entirely, the wife and the children."" ""Well, John,"" said the gentleman, ""you have earned your twelve guineas, and you have been, in every respect, so good a servant, that, if you are agreeable, I intend giving you what is worth the twelve guineas ten times over, in place of your wages. But you shall have your choice. Will you take what I offer, on my word""? John saw no reason to think that his master was jesting with him, or was insincere in making the offer; and, therefore, after a slight consideration, told him that he agreed to take for his wages whatever he would advise, whether it was the twelve guineas or not. ""Then listen attentively to my words,"" said the gentleman. ""First, I would teach you this: Never to take a by-road when you have the highway. Secondly: Take heed not to lodge in the house where an old man is married to a young woman. And thirdly: Remember that honesty the best policy. These are the three advices I would pay you with; and they are in value far beyond any gold; however, here is a guinea for your traveling charges, and two cakes, one of which you must give to your wife, and the other you must not eat yourself until you have done so, and I charge you to be careful of them."" It was not without some reluctance on the part of John Carson that he was made to accept mere words for wages, or could be persuaded that they were more precious than golden guineas. His faith in his master was, however, so strong, that he at length became satisfied. John set out for Ireland the next morning early; but he had not proceeded far, before he overtook two pedlars who were traveling the same way. He entered into conversation with them, and found them a pair of merry fellows, who proved excellent company on the road. Now it happened, towards the end of their day's journey, when they were all tired with walking, that they came to a wood, through which there was a path that shortened the distance to the town they were going towards, by two miles. The pedlars advised John to go with them through the wood; but he refused to leave the highway, telling them, at the same time, he would meet them again at a certain house in the town where travelers put up. John was willing to try the worth of the advice which his master had given him, and he arrived in safety, and took up his quarters at the appointed place. While he was eating his supper, an old man came hobbling into the kitchen, and gave orders about different matters there, and then went out again. John would have taken no particular notice of this, but immediately after, a young woman, young enough to be the old man's daughter, came in, and gave orders exactly the contrary of what the old man had given, calling him, at the same time, such as old fool, and old dotard, and so on. When she was gone, John inquired who the old man was. ""He is the landlord,"" said the servant; ""and, heaven help him! A dog's life has he led since he married his last wife."" ""What,"" said John, with surprise, ""is that young woman the landlord's wife? I see I must not remain in this house tonight;"" and, tired as he was, he got up to leave it, but went no further than the door before he met the two pedlars, all cut and bleeding, coming in, for they had been robbed and almost murdered in the wood. John was very sorry to see them in that condition, and advised them not to lodge in the house, telling them, with a significant nod that all was not right there; but the poor pedlars were so weary and so bruised, that they would stop where they were, and disregarded the advice. Rather than remain in the house, John retired to the stable, and laid himself down upon a bundle of straw, where he slept soundly for some time. About the middle of the night, he heard two persons come into the stable, and on listening to their conversation, discovered that it was the landlady and a man, laying a plan how to murder her husband. In the morning John renewed his journey; but at the next town he came to, he was told that the landlord in the town he had left had been murdered and that two pedlars, whose clothes were found all covered with blood, had been taken up for the crime, and were going to be hanged. John, without mentioning what he had overheard to any person, determined to save the pedlars if possible, and so returned, in order to intend their trial. On going into the court, he saw the two men at bar, and the young woman and the man whose voice he had heard in the stable, swearing their innocent lives away. But the judge allowed him to give his evidence, and he told every particular of what had occurred. The man and the young woman instantly confessed their guilt; the poor pedlars were at once acquitted; and the judge ordered a large reward to be paid to John Carson, as through his means the real murderers were brought to justice. John proceeded towards home, fully convinced of the value of two of the advices which his master had given him. On arriving at his cabin he found his wife and children rejoicing over a purse full of gold, which the eldest boy had picked up on the road that morning. Whilst he was away they had endured all the miseries which the wretched families of those who go over to seek work in England are exposed to. With precarious food, without a bed to lie down on, or a roof to shelter them, they had wandered through the country, seeking food from door to door of a starving population; and when a single potato was bestowed, showering down blessings and thanks on the giver, not in the set phrases of the mendicant, but in the burst of eloquence too fervid not to gush direct from the heart. Those only who have seen a family of such beggars as I describe, can fancy the joy with which the poor woman welcomed her husband back, and informed him of the purse full of gold. ""And where did Mick my boy, find it,"" inquired John Carson. ""It was the young squire, for certain, who dropped it,"" said his wife, ""for he rode down the road this morning, and was leaping his horse in the very gap where Micky picked it up; but sure, John, he has money enough, besides, and never the halfpenny have I to buy my poor childer a bit to eat this blessed night."" ""Never mind that,"" said John. ""Do as I bid you, and take up the purse at once to the big house, and ask for the young squire. I have two cakes which I brought every step of the way with me from England, and they will do for the children's supper. I ought surely to remember, as good right I have, what my master told me for my twelvemonths' wages, seeing I never, as yet, found what he said to be wrong!"" ""And what did he say,"" inquired the wife. ""That honesty is the best policy,"" answered John. ""'Tis very well; and 'tis mighty easy for them to say so that have never been sore tempted by distress and famine to say otherwise, but your bidding is enough for me, John."" Straightways she went to the big house, and inquired for the young squire; but she was denied the liberty to speak to him. ""You must tell me your business, honest woman,"" said the servant, with a head all powdered and frizzled like a cauliflower, and who had on a coat covered with gold and silver lace and buttons, and everything in the world. ""If you knew but all,"" said she, ""I am an honest woman, for I've brought a purse full of gold to the young master; for surely it is his; as nobody else could have so much money."" ""Let me see it,"" said the servant. ""Ay, it's all right. I'll take care of it. You need not trouble yourself any more about the matter;"" and so saying, he slapped the door in her face. When she returned, her husband produced the two cakes which his master gave him on parting; and breaking one to divide between his children, how was he astonished to find six guineas, in it; and when he took the other and broke it, he found as many more. He then remembered the words of his generous master, who desired him to give one of the cakes to his wife, and not to eat the other himself until that time; and this was the way his master took to conceal his wages, lest he should have been robbed, or have lost the money on the road. The following day, as John was standing near his cabin door and turning over in his own mind what he should do with his money, the young squire came riding down the road. John pulled off his hat, for he had not forgotten his manners through the means of traveling to foreign parts, and then made so bold as to inquire if his honor had got the purse he lost. ""Why, it is true enough, my good fellow,"" said the squire, ""I did lose my purse yesterday, and I hope you were lucky enough to find it; for if that is your cabin, you seem to be very poor, and shall keep it as a reward for your honesty."" ""Then the servant at the big house never gave it to you last night, after taking it from Nance -- she's my wife, your honor -- and telling her it was all right?"" ""Oh, I must look into this business,"" said the squire. ""Did you say your wife, my poor man, gave my purse to a servant -- to what servant?"" ""I can't tell his name rightly,"" said John, ""because I don't know it; but never trust Nance's eye again if she can't point him out to your honor, if so your honor is desirous of knowing."" ""Then do you and Nance, as you call her, come up to the hall this evening, and I'll inquire into the matter, I promise you."" So saying, the squire rode off. John and his wife went up accordingly in the evening, and he gave a small rap with the big knocker at the great door. The door was opened by a grand servant, who, without hearing what the poor people had to say, exclaimed, ""Oh, go! -- go! what business can you have here?"" and shut the door. John's wife burst out a crying. ""There,"" said she, so sobbing as if her heart would break. ""I knew that would be the end of it."" But John had not been in old England merely to get his twelve guineas packed in two cakes. ""No,"" said he, firmly; ""right is right, and I'll see the end of it."" So he sat himself down on the steps of the door, determined not to go until he had seen the young squire, and as it happened, it was not long before he came out. ""I have been expecting you for some time, John,"" said he; ""come in and bring your wife in;"" and he made them go before him into the house. Immediately he directed all the servants to come up stairs; and such an army of them as there was! It was a real sight to see them. ""Which of you,"" said the young squire, without making further words, ""which of you all did this honest woman give my purse to?"" but there was no answer. ""Well I suppose she must be mistaken, unless she can tell herself."" John's wife at once pointed her finger towards the head footman; ""there he is,"" said she, ""if all the world were in the fore -- clergyman, magistrate, judge, jury and all. There he is, and I am ready to take my bible-oath to him. There he is who told me it was all right when he took the purse, and slammed the door in my face, without as much as thank ye for it."" The conscious footman turned pale. ""What is this I hear?"" said his master. ""If this woman gave you my purse, William, why did you not give it to me?"" The servant stammered out a denial; but his master insisted on his being searched, and the purse was found in his pocket. ""John,"" said the gentleman, turning round, ""you shall be no loser by this affair. Here are ten guineas for you; go home now, but I will not forget your wife's honesty."" Within a month John Carson was settled in a nice new-slated house, which the squire had furnished and made ready for him. What with his wages, and the reward he got from the judge, and the ten guineas for returning the purse, he was well to do in the world, and was soon able to stock a little farm, where he lived respected all his days. On his deathbed, he gave his children the very three advices which his master had given him on parting: Never to lodge in a house where an old man was married to a young woman. And, above all, to remember that honesty is the best policy.",Ireland,"Source: T.

Advice Well Taken,0910b,The Three Advices Which the King with the Red Soles Gave to His Son,"The name of the young chief was Illan, called Don, from his brown hair, and the first thing he set about doing after the funeral, was to test the wisdom of his father's counsels. So he went to the fair of Tailtean [now Telltown in Meath] with a fine mare of his, and rode up and down. He asked twenty gold rings for his beast, but the highest bid he got was only nineteen. To work out his design he would not abate a screpal, but rode home on her back in the evening. He could have readily crossed a ford that lay in his way near home; for sheer devilment he leaped the river higher up, where the banks on both sides were steep. The poor beast stumbled as she came near the edge, and was flung head foremost into the rocky bed, and killed. He was pitched forward, but his fall was broken by some shrubs that were growing in the face of the opposite bank. He was as sorry for the poor mare as any young fellow, fond of horses and dogs, could be. When he got home he sent a giolla to take off the animal's two forelegs at the knee, and these he hung up in the great hall of his dun, having first had them properly dried and prepared. Next day he repaired again to the fair, and got into conversation with a rich chief of Oriel, whose handsome daughter had come to the meeting to purchase some cows. Illan offered his services, as he knew most of the bodachs and the bodachs' wives who were there for the object of selling. A word to them from the handsome and popular young chief, and good bargains were given to the lady. So pleased was her father, ay and she too, with this civility that he forthwith received an invitation to hunt and fish at the northern rath, and very willingly he accepted it. So he returned home in a very pleasant state of mind, and was anxious that this second experiment should succeed better than the first. The visit was paid, and in the mornings there were pleasant walks in the woods with the young lady, while her little brother and sister were chasing one another through the trees, and the hunting and fishing went on afterwards, and there were feasts of venison, and wild boar, and drinking of wine and mead in the evenings, and stories in verse recited by bards, and sometimes moonlight walks on the ramparts of the fort, and at last marriage was proposed and accepted. One morning as Illan was musing on the happiness that was before him, an attendant on his promised bride walked into his room. ""Great must be your surprise, O Illan Don,"" said she, ""at this my visit, but my respect for you will not allow me to see you fall into the pit that is gaping for you. Your affianced bride is an unchaste woman. You have remarked the deformed Fergus Rua, who plays on the small clarsech, and is the possessor of thrice fifty stories. He often attends in her room late in the evening to play soft music to her, and to put her to sleep with this soft music and his stories of the Danaan druids. Who would suspect the weak deformed creature, or the young lady of noble birth? By your hand, O Illan of the brown hair, if you marry her, you will bring disgrace on yourself and your clan. You do not trust my words! Then trust to your own senses. She would most willingly break off all connection with the lame wretch since she first laid eyes on you, but he has sworn to expose her before you and her father. When the household is at rest this night, wait at the entrance of the passage that leads to the women's apartments. I will meet you there. Tomorrow morning you will require no one's advice for your direction."" Before the sun tinged the purple clouds, next morning, Illan was crossing the outer moat of the lios, and lying behind him on the back of his trusty steed, was some long object carefully folded in skins. ""Tell your honored chief,"" said he to the attendant who was conducting him, ""that I am obliged on a sudden to depart, and that I request him by his regard for me to return my visit a fortnight hence, and to bring his fair daughter with him."" On he rode, and muttered from time to time, ""Oh, had I slain the guilty pair, it would be a well merited death! the deformed wretch! the weak lost woman! Now for the third trial!"" Illan had a married sister, whose rath was about twelve of our miles distant from his. To her home he repaired next day, changing clothes with a beggar whom he met on the road. When he arrived, he found that they were at dinner, and several neighboring families with them in the great hall. ""Tell my sister,"" said he to a giolla who was lounging at the door, ""that I wish to speak with her."" ""Who is your sister?"" said the other in an insolent tone, for he did not recognize the young chief in his beggar's dress. ""Who should she be but the Bhan a Teagh, you rascal!"" The fellow began to laugh, but the open palm of the irritated young man coming like a sledge stroke on his cheek, dashed him on the ground, and set him a-roaring. ""Oh, what has caused this confusion?"" said the lady of the house, coming out from the hall. ""I,"" said her brother, ""punishing your giolla's disrespect."" ""Oh, brother, what has reduced you to such a condition?"" ""An attack on my house, and a creagh made on my lands in my absence. I have neither gold nor silver vessels in my dun, nor rich cloaks, nor ornaments, nor arms for my followers. My cattle have been driven from my lands, and all as I was on a visit at the house of my intended bride. You must come to my relief; you will have to send cattle to my ravaged fields, gold and silver vessels, and ornaments and furs, and rich clothes to my house, to enable me to receive my bride and her father in a few days."" ""Poor dear Illan!"" she answered, ""my heart bleeds for you. I fear I cannot aid you, nor can I ask you to join our company within in these rags. But you must be hungry; stay here till I send you some refreshment."" She quitted him, and did not return again, but an attendant came out with a griddle cake in one hand, and a porringer with some Danish beer in it in the other. Illan carried them away to the spot where he had quitted the beggar, and gave him the bread, and made him drink the beer. Then changing clothes with him, he rewarded him, and returned home, bearing the porringer as a trophy. On the day appointed with the father of his affianced, there were assembled in Illan's hall, his sister, his sister's husband, his affianced, her father, and some others. When an opportunity offered after meat and bread, and wine had gone the way of all food, Illan addressed his guests: ""Friends and relations, I am about confessing some of my faults before you, and hope you will be bettered by the hearing. My dying father charged me never to refuse a fair offer for horse, cow, or sheep, at a fair. For refusing a trifle less than I asked for my noble mare, there was nothing left to me but those bits of her forelegs you see hanging by the wall. He advised me never to put on an air of want when soliciting a favor. I begged help of my sister for a pretended need, and because I had nothing better than a beggar's cloak on me, I got nothing for my suit but the porringer that you see dangling by the poor remains of my mare. I wooed a strange lady to be my wife, contrary to my dying father's injunction, and after seeming to listen favorably to my suit, she at last said I should be satisfied with the crutches of her lame and deformed harper: there they are!"" The sister blushed, and was ready to sink through the floor for shame. The bride was in a much more wretched state, and would have fainted, but it was not the fashion of the day. Her father stormed, and said this was but a subterfuge on the part of Illan. He deferred to her pleasure, but though torn with anguish for the loss of the young chief's love and respect, she took the blame on herself. The next morning saw the rath without a visitor; but within a quarter of a year, the kind faced, though not beautiful daughter of a neighboring Duine Uasal (gentleman) made the fort cheerful by her presence. Illan had known her since they were children. He was long aware of her excellent qualities, but had never thought of her as a wife till the morning after his speech. He was fonder of her a month after his marriage than he was on the marriage morning, and much fonder when a year had gone by, and presented his house with an heir.",Ireland,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (London: Macmillan and Company, 1866), pp. 73-77.",NA,NA

Air Castles,1430,Day-Dreaming,"When the Vizier sees me, he will rise and seating me in his own place, sit down below me, because I am his son-in-law. Now I will have with me two slaves with purses, in each a thousand dinars, and I will give him the thousand dinars of the dowry and make him a present of another thousand dinars so that he may recognize my nobility and generosity and greatness of mind and the littleness of the world in my eyes; and for every ten words he will say to me, I will answer him only two. Then I will return to my house, and if anyone come to me on the bride's part, I will make him a present of money and clothe him in a robe of honor; but if he bring me a present I will return it to him and will not accept it so that they may know how great of soul I am. My bride shall stand before me like the full moon, in her robes and ornaments, and I, out of my pride and my disdain, will not look at her, till all who are present shall say to me: ""O my lord, thy wife and thy handmaid stands before thee; deign to look upon her, for standing is irksome to her."" And they will kiss the earth before me many times, whereupon I will lift my eyes and give one glance at her, then bend down my head again. Then they will carry her to the bride-chamber, and meanwhile I will rise and change my clothes for a richer suit. When they bring in the bride for the second time, I will not look at her till they have implored me several times, when I will glance at her and bow down my head; nor will I cease doing thus, till they have made an end of parading and displaying her. Then I will order one of my slaves to fetch a purse, and, giving it to the tire-women, command them to lead her to the bride-chamber. When they leave me alone with the bride, I will not look at her or speak to her, but will sit by her with averted face, that she may say I am high of soul. Presently her mother will come to me and kiss my head and hands and say to me: ""O my lord, look on thy handmaid, for she longs for thy favor, and heal her spirit."" But I will give her no answer; and when she sees this, she will come and kiss my feet and say, ""O my lord, verily my daughter is a beautiful girl, who has never seen man; and if thou show her this aversion, her heart will break; so do thou be gracious to her and speak to her."" Then she will rise and fetch a cup of wine, and her daughter will take it and come to me; but I will leave her standing before me, while I recline upon a cushion of cloth of gold, and will not look at her to show the haughtiness of my heart, so that she will think me to be a sultan of exceeding dignity and will say to me: ""O my lord, for God's sake, do not refuse to take the cup from thy servant's hand, for indeed I am thy handmaid."" But I will not speak to her, and she will press me, saying: ""Needs must thou drink it,"" and put it to my lips. Then I will shake my fist in her face and spurn her with my foot thus.

Air Castles,1430,Lazy Heinz,"Heinz was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but to drive his goat out to the pasture every day, he nevertheless groaned every evening when he returned home after finishing his day's work. ""It is in truth a heavy burden,"" he said, ""and a tiresome job, to drive such a goat out to the field year in and year out until late in the fall. If I could only lie down and sleep at it! But no, I must keep my eyes open so it won't damage the young trees, or force its way through the hedge into a garden, or even run away altogether. How can I get some rest and enjoy life?"" He sat down, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could lift this burden from his shoulders. For a long time his thoughts led to nothing, but suddenly it was as if scales were removed from his eyes. ""I know what I will do,"" he shouted. ""I will marry Fat Trina. She too has a goat, and she can drive mine out with hers, and then I shall no longer have to torment myself."" So Heinz got up, set his weary limbs into motion, and walked across the street, for it was no further than that, to where Fat Trina's parents lived, and asked for the hand in marriage of their industrious and virtuous daughter. Her parents did not think about it for long. ""Birds of a feather, flock together,"" they thought, and gave their consent. So Fat Trina became Heinz's wife, and drove out both of the goats. Heinz now enjoyed life, having no work to rest from, but his own laziness. He went out with her only now and then, saying, ""I'm doing this so that afterwards I will enjoy resting more. Otherwise I shall lose all feeling for it."" However, Fat Trina was no less lazy. ""Dear Heinz,"" she said one day, ""why should we make our lives so miserable, ruining the best days of our youth, when there is no need for it? The two goats disturb our best sleep every morning with their bleating. Wouldn't it be better for us to give them to our neighbor, who will give us a beehive for them? We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and then not give it any more thought. Bees do not have to be taken care of, nor driven into the field. They fly out and find their way home again by themselves, and they collect honey without any effort at all on our part."" ""You have spoken like a sensible woman,"" replied Heinz. ""We will carry out your proposal without delay. And furthermore, honey tastes better and is more nourishing than goat's milk, and it keeps longer too."" The neighbor willingly gave them a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew tirelessly in and out from early morning until late evening, filling the hive with the best honey. Thus that fall-time, Heinz was able to take out a whole jugful. They placed the jug on a shelf on their bedroom wall. Fearing that it might be stolen, or that the mice might get into it, Trina brought in a stout hazel stick and put it beside her bed, so that she would be able to reach it without having to get up, and then from her place in bed drive away the uninvited guests. Lazy Heinz did not like to get out of bed before noon. ""He who rises early,"" he would say, ""wastes his wealth."" One morning when he was still lying in the feathers in broad daylight, resting from his long sleep, he said to his wife, ""Women are fond of sweets, and you have been snacking on the honey. It would be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before you eat it all up."" ""But not before we have a child to take care of them."" replied Trina. Am I to torment myself with the young geese, wasting all my energy on them for no reason?"" ""Do you think,"" said Heinz, ""that the boy will tend geese? Nowadays children no longer obey. They do just as they please, because they think that they are smarter than their parents, just like that servant who was supposed to look for the cow and chased after three blackbirds."" ""Oh,"" replied Trina, ""he will get it if he does not do what I say. I will take a stick and tan his hide with more blows than can be counted."" ""See here, Heinz,"" she shouted in her fervor, seizing the stick that she intended to use to drive away the mice. ""See here! This is how I will beat him."" She struck forth, unfortunately hitting the jug of honey above the bed. The jug struck against the wall and fell down in pieces. The fine honey flowed out onto the floor. ""There lies the goose with the young gosling,"" said Heinz. ""And they do not need to be tended. But it is lucky that the jug did not fall on my head. We have every reason to be satisfied with our fate."" Then noticing that there was still some honey in one of the pieces of the jug, he reached out for it, saying quite happily, ""Wife, let us enjoy the leftovers, and then we will rest a little from the fright we have had. What does it matter if we get up a little later than usual? The day will be long enough."" ""Yes,"" answered Trina, ""there is always time enough. You know, the snail was once invited to a wedding and started on his way, but arrived at the child's baptism. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, 'Haste makes waste.'""",Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Der faule Heinz,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, vol. 2 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 164, pp. 313-15.",I have followed the Grimms' seventh and final edition (1857).

Air Castles,1430,Lean Lisa,"Lean Lisa was not at all like Lazy Heinz and Fat Trina, who would not allow anything to disturb their rest. She burned herself out from morning until evening and loaded so much work on her husband, Lanky Lenz, that it was harder for him than for a donkey loaded with three sacks. But it was all for naught. They had nothing, and they got nothing. One evening she was lying in bed, too tired to move a muscle but still unable to fall asleep, when she poked her husband in the side with her elbow and said, ""Lenz, listen to what I just thought of. If I were to find a florin, and you were to give me another one, then I'd borrow yet another one, and you'd give me still another one, and then I would take the four florins and buy a young cow."" The man agreed. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""where I'm to get that florin I'm supposed to give you, but after you have the money to buy a cow, it will be a good thing."" Then he added, ""I'm looking forward to the time after the cow calves, so I can have some good refreshing milk to drink."" ""The milk is not for you,"" said the woman. ""We will let the calf suck, so it will grow large and fat, and we can sell it for a good price."" ""Of course,"" said the man, ""but it won't hurt anything if we take a little milk."" ""Who taught you about cows?"" said the woman. ""I won't allow it, whether it will hurt anything or not. You can stand on your head, but you won't get a single drop of milk. Lanky Lenz, just because you are always hungry, you think that you can devour everything that my hard work brings in."" ""Woman,"" said the man, ""be quiet, or I'll plant one on the side of your face."" ""What!"" she cried. ""Are you threatening me! You glutton! You good-for-nothing! You lazybones!"" She was reaching for his hair, but Lanky Lenz raised himself up, took hold of both her skinny arms with one hand, then pushed her head into the pillow with the other one.

Air Castles,1430,The Broken Pot,"In a certain place there lived a Brahman by the name of Svabhâvakripana, which means ""luckless by his very nature."" By begging he acquired a quantity of rice gruel, and after he had eaten what he wanted, there was still a potful left. He hung this pot on a nail in the wall above his bed. As night progressed, he could not take his eyes from the pot. All the while he was thinking: Then a Brahman would enter my house and give me a very beautiful girl with a large dowry for my wife. She will give birth to a son, and I will give him the name Somasarman. When he is old enough to be bounced on my knee, I will take a book, sit in the horse stall, and read. In the meantime, Somasarman will see me and want to be bounced on my knee. He will climb down from his mother's lap and walk toward me, coming close to the horses hooves. Then, filled with anger, I will shout at my wife, ""Take the child! Take the child!"" But she, busy with her housework, will not hear me. So I will jump up and give her a kick!

As the merchant was a kind neighbor, he one day sent a flask of oil to the poor man. The poor man was delighted, and put it carefully away on the top shelf. One evening, as he was gazing at it, he said half aloud, ""I wonder how much oil there is in that bottle. There is a large quantity. If I should sell it, I could buy five sheep. Every year I should have lambs, and before long I should own a flock. Then I should sell some of the sheep, and be rich enough to marry a wife. Perhaps we might have a son. And what a fine boy he would be! So tall, strong, and obedient! But if he should disobey me,"" and he raised the staff which he held in his hand, ""I should punish him thus!"" And he swung the staff over his head and brought it heavily to the ground, knocking, as he did so, the flask off the shelf so that the oil ran over him from head to foot.",Bidpai,"Source: The Tortoise and the Geese and other Fables of Bidpai, retold by Maude Barrows Dutton (Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1908), pp. 8-9.",NA,NA

The emperor and all his court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognized his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog.

Androcles and the Lion,0156,Androcles and the Lion,"It happened in the old days at Rome that a slave named Androcles escaped from his master and fled into the forest, and he wandered there for a long time until he was weary and well nigh spent with hunger and despair. Just then he heard a lion near him moaning and groaning and at times roaring terribly. Tired as he was Androcles rose up and rushed away, as he thought, from the lion; but as he made his way through the bushes he stumbled over the root of a tree and fell down lamed, and when he tried to get up there he saw the lion coming towards him, limping on three feet and holding his forepaw in front of him. Poor Androcles was in despair; he had not strength to rise and run away, and there was the lion coming upon him. But when the great beast came up to him instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and groaning and looking at Androcles, who saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, which was covered with blood and much swollen. Looking more closely at it Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lion's trouble. Plucking up courage he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lion's paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he fawned upon Androcles and showed, in every way that he knew, to whom he owed the relief. Instead of eating him up he brought him a young deer that he had slain, and Androcles managed to make a meal from it. For some time the lion continued to bring the game he had killed to Androcles, who became quite fond of the huge beast. But one day a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles, and as he could not explain what he was doing they took him prisoner and brought him back to the town from which he had fled. Here his master soon found him and brought him before the authorities, and he was condemned to death because he had fled from his master. Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions in a huge circus, so that while the criminals were punished the public could enjoy the spectacle of a combat between them and the wild beasts. So Androcles was condemned to be thrown to the lions, and on the appointed day he was led forth into the Arena and left there alone with only a spear to protect him from the lion. The Emperor was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him it fawned upon him and stroked him with its paw and made no attempt to do him any harm. It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor, surprised at seeing such a strange behavior in so cruel a beast, summoned Androcles to him and asked him how it happened that this particular lion had lost all its cruelty of disposition. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing its gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon the Emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy liberty once more.",Joseph Jacobs,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, Europa's Fairy Book (New York and London: G.

Androcles and the Lion,0156,Of the Remembrance of Benefits,"There was a knight who devoted much of his time to hunting. It happened one day, as he was pursuing this diversion, that he was met by a lame lion, who showed him his foot. The knight dismounted, and drew from it a sharp thorn; and then applied an unguent to the wound, which speedily healed it. A while after this, the king of the country hunted in the same wood, and caught that lion, and held him captive for many years. Now, the knight, having offended the king, fled from his anger to the very forest in which he had been accustomed to hunt. There he betook himself to plunder, and spoiled and slew a multitude of travelers. But the king's sufferance was exhausted; he sent out an army, captured, and condemned him to be delivered to a fasting lion. The knight was accordingly thrown into a pit, and remained in terrified expectation of the hour when he should be devoured. But the lion, considering him attentively, and remembering his former friend, fawned upon him; and remained seven days with him destitute of food. When this reached the ears of the king, he was struck with wonder, and directed the knight to be taken from the pit. ""Friend,"" said he, ""by what means have you been able to render the lion harmless?"" ""As I once rode along the forest, my lord, that lion met me lame. I extracted from his foot a large thorn, and afterward healed the wound, and therefore he has spared me."" ""Well,"" returned the king, ""since the lion has spared you, I will for this time ratify your pardon. Study to amend your life."" The knight gave thanks to the king, and ever afterwards conducted himself with all propriety. He lived to a good old age, and ended his days in peace. Application: My beloved, the knight is the world; the lame lion is the human race; the thorn, original sin, drawn out by baptism.

Androcles and the Lion,0156,The Lion and the Saint,"The old man with the beard is St. Jerome, who lived fifteen hundred years ago, and I want now to tell you why a lion generally appears in any picture of him. At one time of his life, St. Jerome lived in a monastery he had founded at Bethlehem. One day he and some of his monks were sitting to enjoy the cool of the evening at the gate of the monastery when a big lion suddenly appeared walking up to them. The monks were horribly frightened, and scampered off as fast as they could to take refuge indoors; but St. Jerome had noticed that as the lion walked he limped as though in pain, and the Saint, who always tried to help those in trouble, waited to see what he could do for the poor animal. The lion came near, and when he was quite close he held up one paw and looked plaintively at the men. St. Jerome fearlessly took the paw on his lap, and, on examining it, found a large thorn, which he pulled out, binding up the injured limb. The wound was rather a bad one, but St. Jerome kept the lion with him and nursed him carefully till he was quite well again. The lion was so grateful, and became so much attached to his kind doctor, that he would not leave him, but stayed on in the monastery. Now, in this house no one, from the highest to the lowest, man or beast, was allowed to lead an idle life. It was not easy to find employment for a lion; but at length a daily task was found for him. This was to guard and watch over the ass, who each day carried in the firewood which was cut and gathered in the forest. The lion and ass became great friends, and no doubt the ass felt much comfort in having such a powerful protector. But it happened, on one very hot summer's day, that whilst the ass was at pasture the lion fell asleep. Some merchants were passing that way and seeing the ass grazing quietly, and apparently alone, they stole her and carried her off with them. In due time the lion awoke; but when he looked for the ass she was not to be seen. In vain he roamed about, seeking everywhere; he could not find her; and when evening came he had to return to the monastery alone, and with his head and tail drooping to show how ashamed he felt. As he could not speak to explain matters, St. Jerome feared that he had not been able to resist the temptation to eat raw flesh once more, and that he had devoured the poor ass. He therefore ordered that the lion should perform the daily task of his missing companion, and carry the firewood instead of her. The lion meekly submitted, and allowed the load of faggots to be tied on his back, and carried them safely home. As soon as he was unloaded he would run about for some time, still hoping to find the ass. One day, as he was hunting about in this fashion, he saw a caravan coming along with a string of camels. The camels, as was usual in some places, were led by an ass, and to the lion's joy he recognised his lost friend. He instantly fell on the caravan, and, without hurting any of the camels, succeeded in frightening them all so completely that he had no difficulty in driving them into the monastery where St. Jerome met them. The merchants, much alarmed, confessed their theft, and St. Jerome forgave them, and was very kind to them; but the ass, of course, returned to her former owners. And the lion was much petted and praised for his goodness and cleverness, and lived with St. Jerome till the end of his life.",Andrew Lang,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Red Book of Animal Stories (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1899), pp. 138-42.",Link to a painting of Saint Jerome by Niccolò Antonio Colantonio.,NA

Androcles and the Lion,0156,The Slave and the Lion,"A slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruelly treated, and, in order to avoid capture, betook himself into the desert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave, which he entered and found to by unoccupied. Really, however, it was a lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretched fugitive, the lion himself appeared. The man gave himself up for lost. But, to his utter astonishment, the lion, instead of springing upon him, came and fawned upon him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could. And in course of time it healed up completely. The lion's gratitude was unbounded. He looked upon the man as his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came, however, when the slave began to long for the society of his follow men, and he bade farewell to the lion and returned to the town. Here he was presently recognized and carried off in chains to his former master, who resolved to make an example of him, and ordered that he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theater. On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena, and among the rest a lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect. And then the wretched slave was cast in among them. What was the amazement of the spectators, when the lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight! It was his old friend of the cave! The audience clamored that the slave's life should be spared. And the governor of the town, marveling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.",Aesop,"Source: Æsop's Fables, translated by V. S.

Animal Brides,0402,Chonguita the Monkey Wife,"After walking for many days, Don Juan met an old man on the road. This old man gave Don Juan bread, and told him to go to a palace which was a mile away. ""But as you enter the gate,"" said the old man, ""you must divide the bread which I have given you among the monkeys which are guarding the gate to the palace; otherwise you will not be able to enter."" Don Juan took the bread; and when he reached the palace, he did as the old man had advised him. After entering the gate, he saw a big monkey. Frightened at the sight of the animal, Don Juan was about to run away, when the animal called to him, and said, ""Don Juan, I know that your purpose in coming here was to find your fortune; and at this very moment my daughter Chonguita will marry you."" The archbishop of the monkeys was called, and Don Juan and Chonguita were married without delay. A few days afterwards Don Juan asked permission from his wife to go to the place where he and his brothers had agreed to meet. When Chonguita's mother heard that Don Juan was going away, she said to him, ""If you are going away, take Chonguita with you."" Although Don Juan was ashamed to go with Chonguita because she was a monkey, he was forced to take her, and they set out together. When Don Juan met his two brothers and their beautiful wives at the appointed place, he could not say a word. Don Diego, noticing the gloomy appearance of his brother, said, ""What is the matter with you? Where is your wife, Don Juan?"" Don Juan sadly replied, ""Here she is."" ""Where?"" asked Don Pedro. ""Behind me,"" replied Don Juan. When Don Pedro and Don Diego saw the monkey, they were very much surprised. ""Oh!"" exclaimed Don Pedro. ""What happened to you? Did you lose your head?"" Don Juan could say nothing to this question. At last, however, he broke out, ""Let us go home! Our father must be waiting for us."" So saying, Don Juan turned around and began the journey. Don Pedro and Don Diego, together with their wives, followed Don Juan. Chonguita walked by her husband's side. When the return of the three brothers was announced to the king, the monarch hastened to meet them on the stairs. Upon learning that one of his sons had married a monkey, the king fainted; but after he had recovered his senses, he said to himself, ""This misfortune is God's will. I must therefore bear it with patience."" The king then assigned a house to each couple to live in. But the more the king thought of it, the greater appeared to be the disgrace that his youngest son had brought on the family. So one day he called his three sons together, and said to them, ""Tell your wives that I want each one of them to make me an embroidered coat. The one who fails to do this within three days will be put to death."" Now, the king issued this order in the hope that Chonguita would be put to death, because he thought that she would not be able to make the coat; but his hope was disappointed. On the third day his daughters-in-law presented to him the coats that they had made, and the one embroidered by Chonguita was the prettiest of all. Still anxious to get rid of the monkey wife, the king next ordered his daughters-in-law to embroider a cap for him in two days, under penalty of death in case of failure. The caps were all done on time. At last, thinking of no other way by which he could accomplish his end, the king summoned his three daughters-in-law, and said, ""The husband of the one who shall be able to draw the prettiest picture on the walls of my chamber within three days shall succeed me on the throne."" At the end of the three days the pictures were finished. When the king went to inspect them, he found that Chonguita's was by far the prettiest, and so Don Juan was crowned king. A great feast was held in the palace in honor of the new king. In the midst of the festivities Don Juan became very angry with his wife for insisting that he dance with her, and he hurled her against the wall. At this brutal action the hall suddenly became dark; but after a while it became bright again, and Chonguita had been transformed into a beautiful woman.",Philippines,"Source: Dean S.

Animal Brides,0402,Doll i' the Grass,"Once on a time there was a king who had twelve sons. When they were grown big he told them they must go out into the world and win themselves wives, but these wives must each be able to spin, and weave, and sew a shirt in one day, else he wouldn't have them for daughters-in-law. To each he gave a horse and a new suit of mail, and they went out into the world to look after their brides; but when they had gone a bit of the way, they said they wouldn't have Boots, their youngest brother, with them. He wasn't fit for anything. Well, Boots had to stay behind, and he didn't know what to do or whither to turn; and so he grew so downcast, he got off his horse, and sat down in the tall grass to weep. But when he had sat a little while, one of the tufts in the grass began to stir and move, and out of it came a little white thing, and when it came nearer, Boots saw it was a charming little lassie, only such a tiny bit of a thing. So the lassie went up to him, and asked if he would come down below and see ""Doll i' the Grass."" Yes, he'd be very happy; and so he went. Now, when he got down, there sat Doll i' the Grass on a chair. She was so lovely and so smart, and she asked Boots wither he was going, and what was his business. So he told her how there were twelve brothers of them, and how the king had given them horse and mail, and said they must each go out into the world and find them a wife who could spin, and weave, and sew a shirt in a day. ""But if you'll only say at once you'll be my wife, I'll not go a step farther,"" said Boots to Doll i' the Grass. Well, she was willing enough, and so she made haste and span, and wove, and sewed the shirt, but it was so tiny, tiny little. It wasn't longer than so ---- long. So Boots set off home with it, but when he brought it out he was almost ashamed, it was so small. Still the king said he should have her, and so Boots set off, glad and happy to fetch his little sweetheart. So when he got to Doll i' the Grass, he wished to take her up before him on his horse; but she wouldn't have that, for she said she would sit and drive along in a silver spoon, and that she had two small white horses to draw her. So off they set, he on his horse and she on her silver spoon, and the two horses that drew her were two tiny white mice. But Boots always kept the other side of the road, he was so afraid lest he should ride over her, she was so little. So when they had gone a bit of the way, they came to a great piece of water. Here Boots' horse got frightened, and shied across the road and upset the spoon, and Doll i' the Grass tumbled into the water. Then Boots got so sorrowful, because he didn't know how to get her out again. But in a little while up came a merman with her, and now she was as well and full grown as other men and women, and far lovelier than she had been before. So he took her up before him on his horse, and rode home. When Boots got home all his brothers had come back, each with his sweetheart, but these were all so ugly, and foul, and wicked, that they had done nothing but fight with one another on the way home, and on their heads they had a kind of hat that was daubed over with tar and soot, and so the rain had run down off the hats onto their faces, till they got far uglier and nastier than they had been before. When his brothers saw Boots and his sweetheart, they were all as jealous as jealous could be of her; but the king was so overjoyed with them both, that he drove all the others away, and so boots held his wedding feat with Doll i' the Grass, and after that they lived well and happily together a long, long time, and if they're not dead, why they're alive still.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Popular Tales from the Norse, translated by George Webbe Dasent (Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1888), pp. 374-376.","This tale differs from others in this group in that the ""creature"" discovered by the hero in his search for a bride is not a creepy, crawly thing, but rather a beautiful -- but diminutive -- human (or possibly elfin) female.

Animal Brides,0402,The Cat Who Became a Queen,"""Ah me! Ah me! What availeth my marriage with all these women? Never a son has the Deity vouchsafed me. Must I die, and my name be altogether forgotten in the land?"" Thus soliloquized one of the greatest monarchs that ever reigned in Kashmir, and then went to his zanána [the apartment where his wives lived], and threatened his numerous wives with banishment if they did not bear him a son within the next year. The women prayed most earnestly to the god Shiva to help them to fulfil the king's desire, and waited most anxiously for several months, hoping against hope, till at last they knew that it was all in vain, and that they must dissemble matters if they wished to remain in the royal household. Accordingly, on an appointed time, word was sent to the king that one of his wives was enciente, and a little while afterwards the news was spread abroad that a little princess was born. But this, as we have said, was not so. Nothing of the kind had happened. The truth was, that a cat had given birth to a lot of kittens, one of which had been appropriated by the king's wives. When his majesty heard the news he was exceedingly glad, and ordered the child to be brought to him -- a very natural request, which the king's wives had anticipated, and therefore were quite prepared with a reply. ""Go and tell the king,"" said they to the messenger, ""that the Brahmans have declared that the child must not be seen by her father until she is married."" Thus the matter was hushed for a time. Constantly did the king inquire after his daughter, and received wonderful accounts of her beauty and cleverness; so that his joy was great. Of course he would like to have had a son, but since the Deity had not condescended to fulfil his desire, he comforted himself with the thought of marrying his daughter to some person worthy of her, and capable of ruling the country after him. Accordingly, at the proper time he commissioned his counselors to find a suitable match for his daughter. A clever, good, and handsome prince was soon found, and arrangements for the marriage were quickly concluded. What were the king's wives to do now? It was of no use for them to attempt to carry on their deceit any longer. The bridegroom would come and would wish to see his wife, and the king, too, would expect to see her. ""Better,"" said they, ""that we send for this prince and reveal everything to him, and take our chance of the rest. Never mind the king. Some answer can be made to satisfy him for a while."" So they sent for the prince and told him everything, having previously made him swear that he would keep the secret, and not reveal it even to his father or mother. The marriage was celebrated in grand style, as became such great and wealthy kings, and the king was easily prevailed on to allow the palanquin containing the bride to leave the palace without looking at her. The cat only was in the palanquin, which reached the prince's country in safety. The prince took great care of the animal, which he kept locked up in his own private room, and would not allow anyone, not even his mother, to enter it. One day, however, while the prince was away, his mother thought that she would go and speak to her daughter-in-law from outside the door. ""O daughter-in-law,"" she cried, ""I am very sorry that you are shut up in this room and not permitted to see anybody. It must be very dull for you. However, I am going out today; so you can leave the room without fear of seeing anyone. Will you come out?"" The cat understood everything, and wept much, just like a human being. Oh those bitter tears! They pierced the mother's heart, so that she determined to speak very strictly to her son on the matter as soon as he should return. They also reached the ears of Párvatí [the wife of Shiva], who at once went to her lord and entreated him to have mercy on the poor helpless cat. ""Tell her,"" said Shiva, ""to rub some oil over her fur, and she will became a beautiful woman. She will find the oil in the room where she now is."" Párvatí lost no time in disclosing this glad news to the cat, who quickly rubbed the oil over its body, and was changed into the most lovely woman that ever lived. But she left a little spot on one of her shoulders which remained covered with cat's fur, lest her husband should suspect some trickery and deny her. In the evening the prince returned and saw his beautiful wife, and was delighted. Then all anxiety as to what he should reply to his mother's earnest solicitations fled. She had only to see the happy, smiling, beautiful bride to know that her fears were altogether needless. In a few weeks the prince, accompanied by his wife, visited his father-in-law, who, of course, believed the princess to be his own daughter, and was glad beyond measure. His wives too rejoiced, because their prayer had been heard and their lives saved. In due time the king settled his country on the prince, who eventually ruled over both countries, his father's and his father-in-law's, and thus became the most illustrious and wealthy monarch in the world.",India,"Source: J.

Animal Brides,0402,The Dog Bride,"Once upon a time there was a youth who used to herd buffaloes; and as he watched his animals graze he noticed that exactly at noon every day a she-dog used to make its way to a ravine, in which there were some pools of water. This made him curious and he wondered to whom it belonged and what it did in the ravine. So he decided to watch, and one day when the dog came he hid himself and saw that when it got to the water, it shed its dog skin, and out stepped a beautiful maiden and began to bathe. And when she had finished bathing she put on the skin and became a dog again, and went off to the village. The herdboy followed her and watched into what house she entered, and he inquired to whom the house belonged. Having found out all about it, he went back to his work. That year the herdboy's father and mother decided that it was time for him to marry and began to look about for a wife for him. But he announced that he had made up his mind to have a dog for his wife, and he would never marry a human girl. Everyone laughed at him for such an extraordinary idea, but he could not be moved. So at last they concluded that he must really have the soul of a dog in him, and that it was best to let him have his own way. So his father and mother asked him whether there was any particular dog he would like to have for his bride, and then he gave the name of the man into whose house he had tracked the dog that he had seen going to the ravine. The master of the dog laughed at the idea that anyone should wish to marry her, and gladly accepted a bride's price for her. So a day was fixed for the wedding and the booth built for the ceremony, and the bridegroom's party went to the bride's house, and the marriage took place in due form, and the bride was escorted to her husband's house. Every night when her husband was asleep, the bride used to come out of the dog's skin and go out of the house. And when her husband found out this, he one night only pretended to go to sleep and lay watching her. And when she was about to leave the room he jumped up and caught hold of her and seizing the dog skin, threw it into the fire, where it was burnt to ashes. So his bride remained a woman, but she was of more than human beauty. This soon became known in the village, and everyone congratulated the herdboy on his wisdom in marrying a dog. Now the herdboy had a friend named Jitu, and when Jitu saw what a prize his friend had got, he thought that he could not do better than marry a dog himself. His relations made no objection, and a bride was selected, and the marriage took place, but when they were putting vermilion on the bride's forehead she began to growl; but in spite of her growling they dragged her to the bridegroom's house, and forcibly anointed her with oil and turmeric. But when the bride's party set off home, the dog broke loose and ran after them. Then everyone shouted to Jitu to run after his bride and bring her back, but she only growled and bit at him, so that he had at last to give it up. Then everyone laughed at him so much that he was too ashamed to speak, and two or three days later he hanged himself.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 85, pp. 254-256.","From the preface: ""The Santals are a Munda tribe, a branch of that aboriginal element which probably entered India from the northeast.

Animal Brides,0402,The Frog,"Not letting themselves be distracted, the man and the woman raised her. They taught her music and all kinds of skills. Above all else the frog loved to sing, and she trained her voice and her range until one would think she was the best singer from the city. Other people had not seen the frog and thought indeed that she was an unknown singer and could not explain why she did not perform in public. One day the king's son passed by the house and heard the frog singing. He stopped and listened for a long time. He immediately fell in love with the unknown singer and approached her father with a request for permission to see her and speak with her, but the father refused. The prince heard her sing again and fell even more deeply in love with her. He demanded that her father give her to him in marriage. The father replied that he would have to ask his daughter. The frog agreed under the conditions that she be taken to the royal castle in an enclosed carriage and that she be allowed to enter the bridal chamber without being seen. The prince, his curiosity even more aroused, accepted the conditions. On the appointed day the frog rode to the royal castle in a tightly enclosed carriage and made her way to the splendid bridal chamber without being seen. She hid herself in one of the two beds that were there. The prince came that evening and was astonished when he could not find his bride. Disappointed, he went to bed. At midnight the frog crept out of the cushions and onto the prince's breast. Half asleep, he took the frog into his hand and threw her to the floor. She hopped angrily down the steps and home. The next morning the prince was sorry that he had thrown the frog to the floor, and he became sad and melancholy. Some time later he went back to the house. Hearing singing, he fell madly in love and began courting his bride anew. The frog accepted, this time without setting any conditions. She made a little carriage out of cardboard, hitched a rooster to it, and drove it herself to the royal castle. Three fairies were standing in the road. One of them had swallowed a fishbone, which stuck in her throat and was causing her great pain. When the three of them saw the frog driving by in her little carriage and cracking her whip so merrily, they all laughed out with joy. The fishbone dislodged itself from the one fairy's throat, freeing her suddenly of her pain. They approached the frog, and the first one said, ""I will give you a beautiful carriage with horses and servants!"" And in an instant a carriage was there with horses and servants in beautiful livery. Then the second one said, ""I will give you expensive clothes and gold and silver!"" And in an instant it was all there, gleaming and shimmering, and it was such a joy. Then came the third fairy, the one who had been freed of the fishbone by laughing, and she said, ""I will transform you!"" In that instant the frog became a beautiful maiden. She graciously thanked the three kind fairies and drove happily to the royal castle and to her jubilant and joyful wedding.",Austria/Italy,"Source: Christian Schneller, Märchen und Sagen aus Wälschtirol: Ein Beitrag zur deutschen Sagenkunde (Innsbruck: Verlag der Wagner'schen Universitäts-Buchhandlung, 1867), no. 29, pp. 82-84.",NA,Translated by D.

Animal Brides,0402,The Frog's Bridegroom,"Once upon a time there was a father who had three sons. He sent two of them out to find brides for themselves, but the third one, stupid Hansl, was to stay home and feed the animals. He was not satisfied with this, so the father finally said, ""Just go. You can look for a bride too."" So Hansl left, and he came to a great forest. On the other side of the forest there was a pond. A frog was sitting on the pond's bank, and it asked, ""Now there, Hansl, where are you going?"" ""Oh, I'm looking for a bride!"" ""Marry me!"" said the frog, and this was all right with Hansl, because he did not know where he might find a bride. The frog jumped into the pond, and Hansl went back home. His brothers were already there, and they wanted to know if the fool had found a bride. ""Yes,"" said Hansl, ""I have one already!"" The next day the father gave each one a bundle of flax, saying, ""I will give the house to the one of you whose bride can spin the most beautiful yarn in three days."" Then each one left, including Hansl. The frog was again sitting on the bank of the pond. ""Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"" ""To you. Can you spin?"" ""Yes,"" said the frog. Just tie the flax onto my back."" Hansl did this, and the frog jumped into the pond. One strand of flax was sticking out below and the other one above. ""Too bad about the flax. It's gone,"" thought Hans, and he sadly went back home. But nonetheless, on the third day he returned to the pond. The frog was again sitting on the bank, and it asked, ""Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"" ""Have you spun?"" ""Yes,"" said the frog, hopped into the pond, and returned with a skein of yarn that was more beautifully spun than any other. Hans was happy, and he joyfully ran back home, and he did indeed have the most beautiful yarn. The brothers complained, and then the father said, ""I will give the house to the one of you who brings home the most beautiful bride."" The brothers left once again, but this time Hansl took a water jug with him. The other two wanted to know, ""Why are you taking a water jug with you?"" ""To put my bride in."" The two laughed, ""He must have some beautiful bride!"" The frog was already sitting next to the pond. ""Now there, bridegroom, where are you going?"" ""Today I am coming for you!"" Then the frog jumped into the pond and came back with three keys. ""Go up there,"" it said. ""There is a castle up there. One of these three keys unlocks the living room, one unlocks the stall, and one unlocks the carriage house. In the living room there are three robes: a red one, a green one, and a white one. In the stall there are two white horses, two black ones, and two brown ones. In the carriage house are three coaches: one of gold, one of silver, and one of glass. In each place you can take what you want."" Once in the castle Hansl first tried on the red robe, but he did not like it: ""It makes me look like a butcher."" He did not like the green one either: ""It makes me look like a hunter."" The white one suited him well. Then he went to the stall and took the brown horses. In the carriage house he first wanted to take the golden coach, but it was too lordly for him. The silver one was too heavy, so he took the glass one. He hitched up the brown horses and drove to the pond. A beautiful young woman was standing there. She said, ""You have redeemed me. If you had taken the best thing in each place then I would have had to remain a frog. And the great forest is a fruit orchard, and the pond is a rose garden. All this belongs to you. Let your brothers have the house. You can marry anyone you want to."" ""No, you must come with me, so that my father and my brothers can see you."" So she rode off with him. The father and the brothers were amazed when they saw Hansl with the beautiful young woman in the coach. But she suddenly disappeared and flew into the air as a white dove. Hansl gave the house to his brothers. He married a woman from his estate and was very happy. And if he hasn't died, then he still must be alive.",Germany,"Source: Gustav Jungbauer, Böhmerwald-Märchen (Passau, 1923), no. 1.",NA,Translated by by D. L. Ashliman. Copyright 1999.
Animal Brides,0402,The Frog's Skin,"There were once three brothers who wished to marry. They said, ""Let us each shoot an arrow, and each shall take his wife from the place where the arrow falls."" They shot their arrows; those of the two elder brothers fell on noblemen's houses, while the youngest brother's arrow fell in a lake. The two elder brothers led home their noble wives, and the youngest went to the shore of the lake. He saw a frog creep out of the lake and sit down upon a stone. He took it up and carried it back to the house. All the brothers came home with what fate had given them; the elder brothers with the noble maidens, and the youngest with a frog. The brothers went out to work. The wives prepared the dinner and attended to all their household duties. The frog sat by the fire croaking, and its eyes glittered. Thus they lived together a long time in love and harmony. At last the sisters-in-law wearied of the sight of the frog. When they swept the house, they threw out the frog with the dust. If the youngest brother found it, he took it up in his hand; if not, the frog would leap back to its place by the fire and begin to croak. The noble sisters did not like this, and said to their husbands, ""Drive this frog out, and get a real wife for your brother."" Every day the brothers bothered the youngest. He replied, saying, ""This frog is certainly my fate. I am worthy of no better. I must be faithful to it."" His sisters-in-law persisted in telling their husbands that the brother and his frog must be sent away, and at last they agreed. The young brother was now left quite desolate. There was no one to make his food, no one to stand watching at the door. For a short time a neighboring woman came to wait upon him, but she had not time, so he was left alone. The man became very melancholy. Once when he was thinking sadly of his loneliness, he went to work. When he had finished his day's labor, he went home. He looked into his house and was struck with amazement. The sideboard was well replenished; in one place was spread a cloth, and on the cloth were many different kinds of tempting dishes. He looked and saw the frog in its place croaking. He said to himself that his sisters-in-law must have done this for him, and went to his work again. He was out all day working, and when he came home he always found everything prepared for him. Once he said to himself, ""I will see for once who is this unseen benefactor, who comes to do good to me and look after me."" That day he stayed at home; he seated himself on the roof of the house and watched. In a short time the frog leaped out of the fireplace, jumped over to the doors, and all around the room. Seeing no one there, it went back and took off the frog's skin, put it near the fire, and came forth a beautiful maiden, fair as the sun; so lovely was she that the man could not imagine anything prettier. In the twinkling of an eye she had tidied everything, prepared the food, and cooked it. When everything was ready, she went to the fire, put on the skin again, and began to croak. When the man saw this he was very much astonished; he rejoiced exceedingly that God had granted him such happiness. He descended from the roof, went in, caressed his frog tenderly, and then sat down to his tasty supper. The next day the man hid himself in the place where he had been the day before. The frog, having satisfied itself that nobody was there, stripped off its skin and began its good work. This time the man stole silently into the house, seized the frog's skin in his hand and threw it into the fire. When the maiden saw this she entreated him, she wept, and she said, ""Do not burn it, or you shall surely be destroyed,"" but the man had burned it in a moment. ""Now, if your happiness be turned to misery, it is not my fault,"" said the sorrow-stricken woman. In a very short time the whole countryside knew that the man who had a frog now possessed in its place a lovely woman, who had come to him from heaven. The lord of the country heard of this, and wished to take her from him. He called the beautiful woman's husband to him and said, ""Sow a barnful of wheat in a day, or give me your wife."" When he had spoken thus, the man was obliged to consent, and he went home melancholy. When he went in he told his wife what had taken place. She reproached him, saying, ""I told you what would happen if you did burn the skin, and you did not heed me; but I will not blame you. Be not sad; go in the morning to the edge of the lake from which I came, and call out, 'Mother and Father! I pray you, lend me your swift bullocks.' Lead them away with you, and the bullocks will in one day plow the fields and sow the grain."" The husband did this. He went to the edge of the lake and called out, ""Mother and Father! I entreat you, lend me your swift bullocks today."" There came forth from the lake such a team of oxen as was never seen on sea or land. The youth drove the bullocks away, came to his lord's field, and plowed and sowed them in one day. His lord was very much surprised. He did not know if there was anything impossible to this man, whose wife he wanted. He called him a second time, and said, ""Go and gather up the wheat you have sown, that not a grain may be wanting, and that the barn may be full. If you do not do this, your wife is mine."" ""This is impossible,"" said the man to himself. He went home to his wife, who again reproached him, and then said, ""Go to the lake's edge and ask for the jackdaws."" The husband went to the edge of the lake and called out, ""Mother and Father! I beg you to lend me your jackdaws today."" From the lake came forth flocks of jackdaws; they flew to the plowed ground, each gathered up a seed and put it into the barn. The lord came and cried out, ""There is one seed short; I know each one, and one is missing."" At that moment a jackdaw's caw was heard; it came with the missing seed, but owing to a lame foot it was a little late. The lord was very angry that even the impossible was possible to this man, and could not think what to give him to do. He puzzled his brain until he thought of the following plan. He called the man and said to him, ""My mother, who died in this village, took with her a ring. If you go to the other world and bring that ring back to me, it is well; if not, I shall take away your wife."" The man said to himself, ""This is quite impossible."" He went home and complained to his wife. She reproached him, and then said, ""Go to the lake and ask for the ram."" The husband went to the lake and called out, ""Mother and Father! Give me your ram today, I pray you."" From the lake there came forth a ram with twisted horns; from its mouth issued a flame of fire. It said to the man, ""Mount on my back!"" The man sat down, and, quick as lightning, the ram descended towards the lower regions. It went on and shot like an arrow through the earth. They traveled on, and saw in one place a man and woman sitting on a bullock's skin, which was not big enough for them, and they were like to fall off. The man called out to them, ""What can be the meaning of this, that this bullock skin is not big enough for two people?"" They said, ""We have seen many pass by like you, but none has returned. When you come back we shall answer your question."" They went on their way and saw a man and woman sitting on an ax handle, and they were not afraid of falling. The man called out to them, ""Are you not afraid of falling from the handle of an ax?"" They said to him, ""We have seen many pass by like you, but none has returned. When you come back we shall answer your question."" They went on their way again, until they came to a place where they saw a priest feeding cattle. This priest had such a long beard that it spread over the ground, and the cattle, instead of eating grass, fed on the priest's beard, and he could not prevent it. The man called out, ""Priest, what is the meaning of this? Why is your beard pasture for these cattle?"" The priest replied, ""I have seen many pass by like you, but none has returned. When you come back I shall answer your question."" They journeyed on again until they came to a place where they saw nothing but boiling pitch, and a flame came forth from it -- and this was hell. The ram said, ""Sit firmly on my back, for we must pass through this fire."" The man held fast. The ram gave a leap, and they escaped through the fire unhurt. There they saw a melancholy woman seated on a golden throne. She said; ""What is it, my child? What troubles you? What has brought you here?"" He told her everything that had happened to him. She said, ""I must punish this very wicked child of mine, and you must take him a casket from me."" She gave him a casket, and said, ""Whatever you do, do not open this casket yourself. Take it with you, give it to your lord, and run quickly away from him."" The man took the casket and went away. He came to the place where the priest was feeding the cattle. The priest said, ""I promised you an answer. Hearken unto my words: In life I loved nothing but myself; I cared for nothing else. My flocks I fed on other pastures than my own, and the neighboring cattle died of starvation. Now I am paying the penalty."" Then he went on to the place where the man and woman were sitting on the handle of the ax. They said, ""We promised you an answer. Hearken unto our words: We loved each other too well on earth, and it is the same with us here."" Then he came to the two seated on the bullock skin, which was not big enough for them. They said, ""We promised you an answer. Hearken unto our words: We despised each other in life, and we equally despise each other here."" At last the man came up on earth, descended from the ram, and went to his lord. He gave him the casket and quickly ran away. The lord opened the casket, and there came forth fire, which swallowed him up. Our brother was thus victorious over his enemy, and no one took his wife from him. They lived lovingly together, and blessed God as their deliverer.",Georgia,"Source: Marjory Wardrop, Georgian Folk Tales (London, 1894), pp. 15-21.",NA,NA
Animal Brides,0402,The Mouse Maiden,"There are a king and a queen of a certain city, and there is a daughter of the queen. They asked permission to summon the daughter to go in marriage to the prince of another city. The king said, ""Ha,"" so they came from that city to summon the king's princess. After coming, they told the bride to come out of her chamber in order to eat the rice of the wedding feast. The queen said, ""She is eating cooked rice in the house."" Then they told her to come out in order to dress her in the robes sent by the bridegroom. The queen said, ""She is putting on robes in her chamber."" Then they told her to come out in order to go to the bridegroom's city. So the queen told two persons to come, and, having put a female mouseling in an incense box, brought it, and gave it into the hands of the two persons, and said, ""Take this, and until seven days have gone by, do not open the mouth of the box."" Having taken it to the city, when they opened the mouth of the box after seven days, a mouse sprang out, and hid itself among the cooking pots. There was also a servant girl at the prince's house. The girl apportioned and gave cooked rice and vegetable curry to the prince, and covered up the cooking pots containing the rest of the food. Then the mouseling came and, having taken and eaten some of the cooked rice and vegetables, covered up the cooking pots, and went again among the pots. On the following day the same thing occurred. The prince said to the girl, ""Does the mouseling eat the cooked rice? Look and come back."" The girl, having gone and looked, came back and said, ""She has eaten the cooked rice, and covered the cooking pots, and has gone."" The prince said, ""Go also, and eat rice, and come back."" So the girl went and ate rice, and returned. Next day the prince said, ""I am going to cut paddy (growing rice). Remain at the house, and in the evening place the articles for cooking near the hearth."" Then the prince went. Afterwards, in the evening, the girl placed the things for cooking near the hearth, and went out of the way. The mouseling came, and cooked, and placed the food ready, and again went behind the pots. After evening had come, that girl apportioned and gave the rice to the prince. The prince ate, and told the girl, ""Go also, and eat rice, and come back."" So the girl went and ate rice, and, having covered the cooking pots, came to the place where the prince was. Then the mouseling came and ate rice, and covered up the pots. After that, she said to the other mice, ""Let us go and cut the paddy,"" and, collecting a great number of mice, cut all the paddy, and again returned to the house, and stayed among the pots. Next day when the prince went to the rice field to cut the paddy, all had been cut. Afterwards the prince came back, and, saying ""Let us go and collect and stack the paddy,"" collected the men, and stacked it, and threshed it by trampling it with buffaloes. Then they went and called the women, and, having got rid of the chaff in the wind, brought the paddy home. After they had brought it, the prince went near the place where the cooking pots were stored, at which the mouseling was hidden, and said, ""Having pounded this paddy to remove the husk, and cooked rice, let us go to your village to present it to your parents as the first-fruits."" The mouseling said, ""I will not. You go."" So the prince told the girl to pound the paddy and cook rice, and having done this she gave it to the prince. The prince took the package of cooked rice, and went to the mouseling's village, and gave it to the mouseling's mother. The queen asked at the hand of the prince, ""Where is the girl?"" The prince said, ""She refused to come."" The queen said, ""Go back to the city, and, having placed the articles for cooking near the hearth, get hid, and stay in the house."" After the prince returned to the city, he did as she had told him. The mouseling, having come out, took off her mouse jacket, and, assuming her shape as a girl, put on other clothes. While she was preparing to cook, the prince took the mouse jacket and burnt it. Afterwards, when the girl went to the place where the mouse jacket had been, and looked for it, it was not there. Then she looked in the hearth, and saw that there was one sleeve in it. While she was there weeping and weeping, the prince came forward and said, ""Your mother told me to burn the mouse jacket.""

Animal Brides,0402,The She-Wolf,"There was an enchanted mill, so that no one could stay there, because a she-wolf always haunted it. A soldier went once into the mill to sleep. He made a fire in the parlor, went up into the garret above, bored a hole with an auger in the floor, and peeped down into the parlor. A she-wolf came in and looked about the mill to see whether she could find anything to eat. She found nothing, and then went to the fire, and said, ""Skin down! Skin down! Skin down!"" She raised herself upon her hind-legs, and her skin fell down. She took the skin, and hung it on a peg, and out of the wolf came a damsel. The damsel went to the fire, and fell asleep there. He came down from the garret, took the skin, nailed it fast to the mill-wheel, then came into the mill, shouted over her, and said, ""Good morning, damsel! How do you do? She began to scream, ""Skin on me! Skin on me! Skin on me!"" But the skin could not come down, for it was fast nailed. The pair married and had two children. As soon as the elder son got to know that his mother was a wolf, he said to her, ""Mamma! Mamma! I have heard that you are a wolf."" His mother replied, ""What nonsense are you talking! How can you say that I am a wolf?"" The father of the two children went one day into the field to plow, and his son said, ""Papa, let me, too, go with you."" His father said, ""Come."" When they had come to the field, the son asked his father, ""Papa, is it true that our mother is a wolf?"" The father said, ""It is."" The son inquired, ""And where is her skin?"" His father said, ""There it is, on the mill-wheel."" No sooner had the son got home, than he said at once to his mother, ""Mamma! Mamma! You are a wolf! I know where your skin is.""

Animal Brides,0402,The Tsarevna Frog,"One day their father said to his sons: ''My dear boys, take each of you an arrow, draw your strong bow and let your arrow fly; in whatever court it falls, in that court there will be a wife for you."" The arrow of the oldest Tsarevitch fell on a boyar-house just in front of the terem where women live; the arrow of the second Tsarevitch flew to the red porch of a rich merchant, and on the porch there stood a sweet girl, the merchant's daughter. The youngest, the brave Tsarevitch Ivan, had the ill luck to send his arrow into the midst of a swamp, where it was caught by a croaking frog. Ivan Tsarevitch came to his father: ""How can I marry the frog?"" complained the son. ""Is she my equal? Certainly she is not."" ""Never mind, ""replied his father. ""You have to marry the frog, for such is evidently your destiny."" Thus the brothers were married: the oldest to a young boyarishnia, a nobleman's child; the second to the merchant's beautiful daughter, and the youngest, Tsarevitch Ivan, to a croaking frog. After a while the sovereign prince called his three sons and said to them: ""Have each of your wives bake a loaf of bread by tomorrow morning."" Ivan returned home. There was no smile on his face, and his brow was clouded. ""C-r-o-a-k! C-r-o-a-k! Dear husband of mine, Tsarevitch Ivan, why so sad?"" gently asked the frog. ''Was there anything disagreeable in the palace?"" ""Disagreeable indeed,"" answered Ivan Tsarevitch; ""the Tsar, my father, wants you to bake a loaf of white bread by tomorrow."" ""Do not worry, Tsarevitch. Go to bed; the morning hour is a better adviser than the dark evening."" The Tsarevitch, taking his wife's advice, went to sleep. Then the frog threw off her frog skin and turned into a beautiful, sweet girl, Vassilissa by name. She now stepped out on the porch and called aloud: ""Nurses and waitresses, come to me at once and prepare a loaf of white bread for tomorrow morning, a loaf exactly like those I used to eat in my royal father's palace."" In the morning Tsarevitch Ivan awoke with the crowing cocks, and you know the cocks and chickens are never late. Yet the loaf was already made, and so fine it was that nobody could even describe it, for only in fairyland one finds such marvelous loaves. It was adorned all about with pretty figures, with towns and fortresses on each side, and within it was white as snow and light as a feather. The Tsar father was pleased and the Tsarevitch received his special thanks. ""Now there is another task,"" said the Tsar smilingly. ""Have each of your wives weave a rug by tomorrow."" Tsarevitch Ivan came back to his home. There was no smile on his face and his brow was clouded. ""C-r-o-a-k! C-r-o-a-k! Dear Tsarevitch Ivan, my husband and master, why so troubled again? Was not father pleased?"" ''How can I be otherwise? The Tsar, my father, has ordered a rug by tomorrow."" ""Do not worry, Tsarevitch. Go to bed; go to sleep. The morning hour will bring help."" Again the frog turned into Vassilissa, the wise maiden, and again she called aloud: ""Dear nurses and faithful waitresses, come to me for new work. Weave a silk rug like the one I used to sit upon in the palace of the king, my father."" Once said, quickly done. When the cocks began their early ""cock-a-doodle-doo,"" Tsarevitch Ivan awoke, and lo! there lay the most beautiful silk rug before him, a rug that no one could begin to describe. Threads of silver and gold were interwoven among bright-colored silken ones, and the rug was too beautiful for anything but to admire. The Tsar father was pleased, thanked his son Ivan, and issued a new order. He now wished to see the three wives of his handsome sons, and they were to present their brides on the next day. The Tsarevitch Ivan returned home. Cloudy was his brow, more cloudy than before. ""C-r-o-a-k! C-r-o-a-k! Tsarevitch, my dear husband and master, why so sad ? Hast thou heard anything unpleasant at the palace?"" ""Unpleasant enough, indeed! My father, the Tsar, ordered all of us to present our wives to him. Now tell me, how could I dare go with thee?"" ""It is not so bad after all, and could be much worse,"" answered the frog, gently croaking. ""Thou shalt go alone and I will follow thee. When thou hearest a noise, a great noise, do not be afraid; simply say: 'There is my miserable froggy coming in her miserable box.'"" The two elder brothers arrived first with their wives, beautiful, bright, and cheerful, and dressed in rich garments. Both the happy bridegrooms made fun of the Tsarevitch Ivan. ""Why alone, brother?"" they laughingly said to him. ""Why didst thou not bring thy wife along with thee? Was there no rag to cover her? Where couldst thou have gotten such a beauty? We are ready to wager that in all the swamps in the dominion of our father it would be hard to find another one like her."" And they laughed and laughed. Lo! what a noise! The palace trembled, the guests were all frightened. Tsarevitch Ivan alone remained quiet and said: ''No danger; it is my froggy coming in her box."" To the red porch came flying a golden carriage drawn by six splendid white horses, and Vassilissa, beautiful beyond all description, gently reached her hand to her husband. He led her with him to the heavy oak tables, which were covered with snow-white linen and loaded with many wonderful dishes such as are known and eaten only in the land of fairies and never anywhere else. The guests were eating and chatting gaily. Vassilissa drank some wine, and what was left in the tumbler she poured into her left sleeve. She ate some of the fried swan, and the bones she threw into her right sleeve. The wives of the two elder brothers watched her and did exactly the same. When the long, hearty dinner was over, the guests began dancing and singing. The beautiful Vassilissa came forward, as bright as a star, bowed to her sovereign, bowed to the honorable guests and danced with her husband, the happy Tsarevitch Ivan. While dancing, Vassilissa waved her left sleeve and a pretty lake appeared in the midst of the hall and cooled the air. She waved her right sleeve and white swans swam on the water. The Tsar, the guests, the servants, even the gray cat sitting in the corner, all were amazed and wondered at the beautiful Vassilissa. Her two sisters-in-law alone envied her. When their turn came to dance, they also waved their left sleeves as Vassilissa had done, and, oh, wonder! they sprinkled wine all around. They waved their right sleeves, and instead of swans the bones flew in the face of the Tsar father. The Tsar grew very angry and bade them leave the palace. In the meantime Ivan Tsarevitch watched a moment to slip away unseen. He ran home, found the frog skin, and burned it in the fire. Vassilissa, when she came back, searched for the skin, and when she could not find it her beautiful face grew sad and her bright eyes filled with tears. She said to Tsarevitch Ivan, her husband: ''Oh, dear Tsarevitch, what hast thou done? There was but a short time left for me to wear the ugly frog skin. The moment was near when we could have been happy together forever. Now I must bid thee goodbye. Look for me in a faraway country to which no one knows the roads, at the palace of Kostshei the Deathless;"" and Vassilissa turned into a white swan and flew away through the window. Tsarevitch Ivan wept bitterly. Then he prayed to the almighty God, and making the sign of the cross northward, southward, eastward, and westward, he went on a mysterious journey. No one knows how long his journey was, but one day he met an old, old man. He bowed to the old man, who said: ""Good-day, brave fellow. What art thou searching for, and whither art thou going?"" Tsarevitch Ivan answered sincerely, telling all about his misfortune without hiding anything. ''And why didst thou burn the frog skin? It was wrong to do so. Listen now to me. Vassilissa was born wiser than her own father, and as he envied his daughter's wisdom he condemned her to be a frog for three long years. But I pity thee and want to help thee. Here is a magic ball. In whatever direction this ball rolls, follow without fear."" Ivan Tsarevitch thanked the good old man, and followed his new guide, the ball. Long, very long, was his road. One day in a wide, flowery field he met a bear, a big Russian bear. Ivan Tsarevitch took his bow and was ready to shoot the bear. ""Do not kill me, kind Tsarevitch,"" said the bear. ""Who knows but that I maybe useful to thee?"" And Ivan did not shoot the bear. Above in the sunny air there flew a duck, a lovely white duck. Again the Tsarevitch drew his bow to shoot it. But the duck said to him: ""Do not kill me, good Tsarevitch. I certainly shall be useful to thee some day."" And this time he obeyed the command of the duck and passed by. Continuing his way he saw a blinking hare. The Tsarevitch prepared an arrow to shoot it, but the gray, blinking hare said: ""Do not kill me, brave Tsarevitch. I shall prove myself grateful to thee in a very short time."" The Tsarevitch did not shoot the hare, but passed by. He walked farther and farther after the rolling ball, and came to the deep blue sea. On the sand there lay a fish. I do not remember the name of the fish, but it was a big fish, almost dying on the dry sand. "" O Tsarevitch Ivan!"" prayed the fish, ""have mercy upon me and push me back into the cool sea."" The Tsarevitch did so, and walked along the shore. The ball, rolling all the time, brought Ivan to a hut, a queer, tiny hut standing on tiny hen's feet. ""Izboushka! Izboushka!"" -- for so in Russia do they name small huts -- ""Izboushka, I want thee to turn thy front to me,"" cried Ivan, and lo! the tiny hut turned its front at once. Ivan stepped in and saw a witch, one of the ugliest witches he could imagine. ""Ho! Ivan Tsarevitch! What brings thee here?"" was his greeting from the witch. ""O, thou old mischief!"" shouted Ivan with anger. ""Is it the way in holy Russia to ask questions before the tired guest gets something to eat, something to drink, and some hot water to wash the dust off?"" Baba Yaga, the witch, gave the Tsarevitch plenty to eat and drink, besides hot water to wash the dust off. Tsarevitch Ivan felt refreshed. Soon he became talkative, and related the wonderful story of his marriage. He told how he had lost his dear wife, and that his only desire was to find her. ""I know all about it,"" answered the witch. ""She is now at the palace of Kostshei the Deathless, and thou must understand that Kostshei is terrible. He watches her day and night and no one can ever conquer him. His death depends on a magic needle. That needle is within a hare; that hare is within a large trunk; that trunk is hidden in the branches of an old oak tree; and that oak tree is watched by Kostshei as closely as Vassilissa herself, which means closer than any treasure he has."" Then the witch told Ivan Tsarevitch how and where to find the oak tree. Ivan hastily went to the place. But when he perceived the oak tree he was much discouraged, not knowing what to do or how to begin the work. Lo and behold! that old acquaintance of his, the Russian bear, came running along, approached the tree, uprooted it, and the trunk fell and broke. A hare jumped out of the trunk and began to run fast; but another hare, Ivan's friend, came running after, caught it and tore it to pieces. Out of the hare there flew a duck, a gray one which flew very high and was almost invisible, but the beautiful white duck followed the bird and struck its gray enemy, which lost an egg. That egg fell into the deep sea. Ivan meanwhile was anxiously watching his faithful friends helping him. But when the egg disappeared in the blue waters he could not help weeping. All of a sudden a big fish came swimming up, the same fish he had saved, and brought the egg in his mouth. How happy Ivan was when he took it! He broke it and found the needle inside, the magic needle upon which everything depended. At the same moment Kostshei lost his strength and power forever. Ivan Tsarevitch entered his vast dominions, killed him with the magic needle, and in one of the palaces found his own dear wife, his beautiful Vassilissa. He took her home and they were very happy ever after.",Russia,"Source: Verra Xenophontovna Kalamatiano de Blumenthal, Folk Tales from the Russian (Chicago, New York, and London: Rand, McNally and Compnay, 1903), pp. 13-26.","Type 402, ""The Animal Bride""; followed by type 302, ""The Giant Whose Heart Was in an Egg.""",NA
Ant and Grasshopper,0280a,An Ant and a Grasshopper,"""Well,"" says the grasshopper, ""but I was not idle neither; for I sung out the whole season."" ""Nay then,"" said they, ""you shall e'en do well to make a merry year on't, and dance in winter to the tune that you sung in summer."" The moral: A life of sloth is the life of a brute; but action and industry is the bus'ness of a great, a wife, and a good man. Reflexion: ""Go to the ant thou sluggard,"" says the wise-man, which in few words summs up the moral of this fable. 'Tis hard to say of laziness, or luxury, whether it be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous evil. The very soul of the slothful, does effectually but lie drowzing in his body, and the whole man is totally given up to his senses: whereas the profit and the comfort of industry, is substantial, firm, and lasting; the blessings of security and plenty go along with it, and it is never out of season. What's the grasshopper's entertainment now, but a summer's song? A vain and an empty pleasure? Let it be understood, however, that we are not to pass avarice upon the world under the title of good husbandry, and thrift, and under that cover to extinguish charity by not distributing the fruits of it. We are in the first place, to consult our own necessities, but we are then to consider in the second place that the necessities of our neighbours have a Christian right to a part of what we have to spare. For the common offices of humanity are as much duties of self-preservation, as what every individual contributes to its own well-being. It is, in short, the great interest and obligation of particulars, to advance the good of the community. The stress of this moral lies upon the preference of honest labour to idleness; and the refusal of relief, on the one hand, is intended only for a reproof to the inconsiderate loss of opportunity on the other. This does not hinder yet, but that the ants, out of their abundance, ought to have reliev'd the grasshopper in her distress, though 'twas her own fault that brought her to't. For if one man's faults could discharge another man of his duty, there would be no longer any place left for the common offices of society. To conclude, we have our failings, every mother's child of us, and the improvidence of my neighbour must not make me inhumane. The ant did well to reprove the grasshopper for her slothfulness; but she did ill then to refuse her a charity in her distress.","Anianus (L'Estrange, 1692)","Source (Internet Archive): Roger L'Estrange Fables of Æsop and Other Eminent Mythologists, with Morals and Reflections (London: Printed for R.

Ant and Grasshopper,0280a,The Ant and the Grasshopper,"A grasshopper, who had chanced to outlive the summer, and was ready to starve with cold and hunger, approached them with great humility, and begged that they would relieve his necessity, with one grain of wheat or rye. One of the ants asked him, how he had disposed of his time in summer, that he had not taken pains, and laid in a stock, as they had done. ""Alas, gentlemen,"" says he, ""I passed away the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking, singing, and dancing, and never once thought of winter."" ""If that be the case,"" replied the ant, laughing, ""all I have to say is, that they who drink, sing, and dance in summer, must starve in winter."" The Application: As summer is the season of the year in which the industrious and laborious husbandman gathers and lays up such fruits as may supply his necessities in winter; so youth and manhood are the times of life which we should employ and bestow in laying in such a stock of all kind of necessaries, as many suffice for the craving demands of helpless old age. Yet notwithstanding the truth of this, there are many of those which we call rational creatures, who live in a method quite opposite to it, and make it their business to squander away in a profuse prodigality, whatever they get in their younger days: as if the infirmity of age would require so supplies to support it; or, at least, would find them administered to it in some miraculous way. From this fable we learn the admirable lesson, never to lose any present opportunity of providing against the future evils and accidents of life. While health and the flower and vigour of our age remain firm and entire, let us lay them out to the best advantage; that when the latter days take hold of us, and spoil us of our strength and abilities, we may have a store moderately sufficient to subsist upon, which we laid up in the morning of our age. One of the ants asked him how he had disposed of his time in summer, that he had not taken pains and laid in a stock, as they had done. ""Alas! my friends,"" says he, ""I passed away the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking, singing, and dancing, and never once thought of winter. ""If that be the case,"" replied the ant, ""all I have to say is this: that they who drink, sing, and dance in the summer, run a great risk of starving in the winter."" Application: As summer is the season in which the industrious laborious husbandman lays up his supplies for the winter, so youth and manhood are the times of life which we should employ in laying in such a stock as may suffice for helpless old age; yet there are many whom we call rational creatures, who squander away in a profuse prodigality, whatever they get in their younger days, as if the infirmity of age would require no supplies to support it, or at least would find them administered to it in some miraculous way. From this fable we learn this admirable lesson, never to lose the present opportunity of fairly and honestly providing against the future evils and accidents of life; and while health and the vigour of our faculties remain firm and entire, to lay them out to the best advantage; so that when age and infirmities despoil us of our strength and abilities, we may not have to bewail that we have neglected to provide for the wants of our latter days: for it should always be remembered, that ""a youth of revels breeds an age of care,"" and that temperance in youth lays the foundation of health and comfort for old age. ""What were you doing,"" said the ant, ""this last summer?"" ""Oh,"" said the grasshopper, ""I was not idle. I kept singing all the summer long."" Said the ant, laughing and shutting up his granary, ""Since you could sing all summer, you may dance all winter."" Winter finds out what summer lays by. ""Why not come and chat with me,"" said the grasshopper, ""instead of toiling and moiling in that way?"" ""I am helping to lay up food for the winter,"" said the ant, ""and recommend you to do the same."" ""Why bother about winter?"" said the grasshopper. ""We have got plenty of food at present."" But the ant went on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the grasshopper had no food, and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the grasshopper knew: It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.","Aesop (Croxall, 1775) Aesop (Bewick, 1818) Aesop, James, 1848 Aesop (Jacobs, 1894)","Source: Fables of Æsop and Others, translated into English with instructive applications, and a print before each fable, by Samuel Croxall, tenth edition, carefully revised and improved (London: Printed for W.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,Peer Gynt and the Trolls,"Shortly before Christmas, Peer set out again on another expedition. He had heard of a farm on Dovrefell which was invaded by such a number of trolls every Christmas Eve that the people on the farm had to move out, and get shelter at some of their neighbors. He was anxious to go there, for he had a great fancy to come across the trolls again. He dressed himself in some old ragged clothes, and took a tame white bear, which he had, with him, as well as an awl, some pitch, and twine. When he came to the farm he went in and asked for lodgings. ""God help us!"" said the farmer; "" we can't give you any lodgings. We have to clear out of the house ourselves soon and look for lodgings, for every Christmas Eve we have the trolls here."" But Peer thought he should be able to clear the trolls out -- he had done such a thing before; and then he got leave to stay, and a pig's skin into the bargain. The bear lay down behind the fireplace, and Peer took out his awl, and pitch, and twine, and began making a big, big shoe, which it took the whole pig's skin to make. He put a strong rope in for laces, that he might pull the shoe tightly together, and, finally, he armed himself with a couple of handspikes. Shortly he heard the trolls coming. They had a fiddler with them, and some began dancing, while others fell to eating the Christmas fare on the table -- some fried bacon, and some fried frogs and toads, and other nasty things which they had brought with them. During this some of the trolls found the shoe Peer had made. They thought it must belong to a very big foot. They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot each into it; but Peer made haste and tightened the rope, took one of the handspikes and fastened the rope round it, and got them at last securely tied up in the shoe. Just then the bear put his nose out from behind the fireplace, where he was lying, and smelt they were frying something. ""Will you have a sausage, pussy?"" said one of the trolls, and threw a hot frog right into the bear's jaw. ""Scratch them, pussy!"" said Peer The bear got so angry that he rushed at the trolls and scratched them all over, while Peer took the other handspike and hammered away at them as if he wanted to beat their brains out. The trolls had to clear out at last, but Peer stayed and enjoyed himself with all the Christmas fare the whole week. After that the trolls were not heard of there for many years. Some years afterwards, about Christmastime, the farmer was out in the forest cutting wood for the holidays, when a troll came up to him and shouted: ""Have you got that big pussy of yours, yet?"" ""Oh, yes, she is at home behind the fireplace,"" said the farmer; ""and she has got seven kittens all bigger and larger than herself.""

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Cat Mill,"In times past, a kobold frequented a hill above the mill, and every evening he would enter the mill and demand a certain measure of beer, which he then drank.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Cat of Norrhult,"On the estate of Norrhult, in the parish of Rumskulla, the people in olden times were very much troubled by trolls and ghosts. The disturbances finally became so unbearable that they were compelled to desert house and home, and seek an asylum with their neighbors. One old man was left behind, and he, because he was so feeble that he could not move with the rest. Some time thereafter, there came one evening a man having with him a bear, and asked for lodgings for himself and companion. The old man consented, but expressed doubts about his guest being able to endure the disturbances that were likely to occur during the night. The stranger replied that he was not afraid of noises, and laid himself down, with his bear, near the old man's bed. Only a few hours had passed, when a multitude of trolls came into the hut and began their usual clatter. Some of them built the fire in the fireplace, others set the kettle upon the fire, and others again put into the kettle a mess of filth, such as lizards, frogs, worms, etc. When the mess was cooked, the table was laid, and the trolls sat down to the repast. One of them threw a worm to the bear, and said, ""Will you have a fish, kitty?"" Another went to the bear-keeper and asked him if he would not have some of their food. At this the latter let loose the bear, which struck about him so lustily that soon the whole swarm was flying through the door. Some time after, the door was again opened, and a troll with mouth so large that it filled the whole opening peeked in. ""Sic him!"" said the bear-keeper, and the bear soon hunted him away also. In the morning the stranger gathered the people of the village around him and directed them to raise a cross upon the estate, and to engrave a prayer on Cross Mountain, where the trolls dwelt, and they would be freed from their troublesome visitors. Seven years later a resident of Norrhult went to Norrköping. On his way home he met a man who asked him where he came from, and, upon being informed, claimed to be a neighbor, and invited the peasant to ride with him on his black horse Away they went at a lively trot along the road, the peasant supposed, but in fact high up in the air. When it became quite dark the horse stumbled so that the peasant came near falling off. ""It is well you were able to hold on,"" said the horseman. ""That was the point of the steeple of Linköping's cathedral that the horse stumbled against. Listen!"" continued he. ""Seven years ago I visited Norrhult. You then had a vicious cat there. Is it still alive?"" ""Yes, truly, and many more,"" said the peasant. After a time the rider checked his horse and bade the peasant dismount. When the latter looked around him he found himself at Cross Mountain, near his home. Some time later another troll came to the peasant's cottage and asked if that great savage cat still lived. ""Look out!"" said the peasant. ""She is lying there by the oven, and has seven young ones, all worse than she."" ""Oh!"" cried the troll, and rushed for the door. From that time no trolls have ever visited Norrhult.",Sweden,"Source: Herman Hofberg, Swedish Fairy Tales, translated by W. H.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Cat on the Dovrefjell,"Once upon a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a large white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. It so happened that he came to the Dovrefjell on Christmas Eve. He went to a cottage where a man lived whose name was Halvor, and he asked the man for lodging for himself and his white bear. ""God bless us!"" said the man, ""but we can't give anyone lodging just now, for every Christmas Eve the house is so full of trolls that we are forced to move out, and we'll have no shelter over our own heads, to say nothing of providing for anyone else."" ""Oh?"" said the man, ""If that's all, you can very well let me use your house. My bear can sleep under the stove here, and I can sleep in the storeroom."" Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got permission to stay there. The people of the house moved out, but before they went, everything was made ready for the trolls. The table was set with cream porridge and fish and sausages and everything else that was good, just as for any other grand feast. When everything was ready, in came the trolls. Some were large, and some were small. Some had long tails, and some had no tails at all. And some had long, long noses. They ate and drank and tasted everything. Then one of the troll youngsters saw the white bear lying under the stove, so he took a piece of sausage, stuck it onto a fork, and went and poked it against the white bear's nose, burning it. Then he shrieked, ""Kitty, do you want some sausage?"" The white bear rose up and growled, and then chased the whole pack of them out, both large and small. A year later Halvor was out in the woods at midday of Christmas Eve, gathering wood for the holidays, for he expected the trolls again. As he was chopping, he heard a voice shouting from the woods, ""Halvor! Halvor!"" ""Yes?"" said Halvor. ""Do you still have that big cat?"" ""Yes,"" said Halvor. ""She's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she now has seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."" ""Then, we'll never come to your place again,"" shouted the troll in the woods, and since that time the trolls have never eaten their Yule porridge with Halvor on the Dovrefjell.""",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Kjetta på Dovre, Norske Folkeeventyr (1852).","I used the following translation: ""The Cat on the Dovrefell,"" Popular Tales from the Norse, 2nd edition, translated by George Webbe Dasent (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1859), pp. 103-104.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Kobold and the Polar Bear,"This request the farmer would gladly grant, but he confesses that he has no power over his homestead after nightfall, for a malicious kobold (schretel) drives him and his cattle away each evening. The stranger declares his reliance on God, and repeats his request, to which the host gives unwilling assent. Well supplied with food, man and bear prepare to spend the night in the bakery. While both are asleep a red-capped kobold scarcely three spans long comes up to the fire and begins to roast some meat on an iron spit. Jealously it eyes the interlopers, particularly the bear, until passion so overcomes it that it strikes the bear on the back of the head. The bear snarls but makes no move. When the meat drips fat the schretel deals another blow and the bear ""turns the other cheek."" Finally, when the chop sizzles with the heat, the little fellow raises spit and all high above his head and brings it down on the bear's mouth. Then the bear does not prove to be so lazy after all, and the scuffle begins in earnest. For some time neither side has an advantage, but ultimately the kobold is obliged to give in. All the while the bear's master has been watching the melee from a safe retreat in the oven, and even when the disturber of the peace has fled he does not venture forth. On the morrow the householder inquires somewhat anxiously about the health of his visitors, and before they go on learns the events of the night. Later that morning when the farmer has gone out into the field to plow, the disheveled kobold comes running up to him with the query: ""Is your big cat still alive?"" With ready wit the farmer grasps the situation, and assures the kobold that the ""old cat"" in addition to being alive is now the mother of five young ones. Thereupon the kobold flees forever, and since then the farmer and his family have lived happily in the farmhouse.",Germany,"Source: Archer Taylor, ""Schrätel und Wasserbär,"" Modern Philology, vol. 17, no. 6 (October 1919), pp. 305-306.","Taylor's source: an anonymous Middle High German story, probably drawn from Scandinavian sources.",NA
The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Troll and the Bear,"One time, just as the folk were leaving the farm, there came a man who went about with a bear, exhibiting it. They told him why they had to leave, and advised him also to get away from there; but the man begged to be allowed to stay overnight, and as he was bent on doing so they finally gave him leave. Towards evening, the troll came with his sack on his back, sat down by the fire, opened it and pulled out the one toad after the other, took each by a hind leg and held it over the fire till it was roasted, and then swallowed it. So one toad after the other went into him for some time, till he began to be satisfied. Then he turned to the man, and said, ""What's your dog's name?"" ""Toad,"" said the man. The troll took a toad, roasted it, and held it out to the bear, saying, ""Toad shall have a toad,"" but the bear growled, and began to rise. ""Yes,"" said the man to the troll, ""just you take care, and not make him angry, or he'll tear you in pieces."" The troll looked quite frightened, and asked, ""Have you any more like him?"" ""Yes,"" said the man, ""this one has five young ones, which are lying outside on the baking oven."" The troll made haste to tie up the toads he had left in the sack, threw it on his back, and went out at the door in a hurry. Next morning, when the people of the farm came home, the man was lying all right in the bed, and the bear beside the fire, both quite comfortable. When the man told them how he had got on, they were very glad, and bade him come again next Christmas Eve, which he did, but the troll did not come, and has never shown himself there since.",Norway,"Source: William A.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Water-Man,"A bear trainer with his dancing bear once came to an isolated mill and asked the miller to take them in for the night, as there was no village far and wide, and night was already falling. ""I would be glad to take you in,"" said the miller, ""if you are not afraid, for a water-man comes into the mill every night and plays pranks on anyone sleeping or even just passing time in the grinding room, and I don't have room for you anywhere else."" ""What sort of pranks?"" asked the bear trainer. ""Just practical jokes,"" replied the miller, ""but they make the people who come to the mill angry, and they won't come back. I've lost a lot of customers because of this. Once he smeared pitch on someone's boot soles, so that he stuck to the floor when he stood up. He poured water into someone else's boots, or sprinkled bran in their hair. He sewed another person's pockets shut. Once he even put someone who was sleeping in the mill into a sack and hung it on a beam, and more such pranks."" ""If that's all there is, it won' bother me,"" said the bear trainer. ""I'll stay."" So the miller put a bundle of straw on the floor for him, and the man lay down with the bear at his side, and they slept until twelve o'clock. The trainer was awakened by the bear's roaring. He jumped up and saw the bear wrestling with the water-man. The latter had never seen a bear before, and when he took hold of the bear's fur, the bear held him tightly with his paws. The trainer quickly went to the mill and started it running. Then he grabbed the water-man by his feet. The bear held him up, and thus they set him on the millstone and held him there, in spite of his cries, until half of his behind had been ground away. Then they let him go, and went back to sleep. Early the next morning the miller came out and was amazed that both of them were sleeping so soundly. When the trainer woke up he told the miller about their last night's adventure, at which the miller had to laugh until he held his belly. As they parted, the miller gave presents to the bear trainer, and invited him to stay with him the next time he came that way. Then he lit his pipe and lay down contentedly near the window. A little dwarf came up to him. He was wearing yellow trousers, a bright-red vest, a green jacket, and a blue cap. He said to the smoker, ""Miller, do you still have that big cat?"" ""Yes,"" said the latter, ""I still have her."" ""Farewell then.

The Bear Trainer and His Cat,1161,The Water Nix in the Oil Mill near Frauendorf,"Ages ago a water nix would bring fish to the so-called Oil Mill located at Frauendorf Manor on a channel of the River Spree near Cottbus. The nix would ask the miller to cook the fish, after which the nix would eat them right at the mill. With time these uncanny visits came to annoy the miller, but he never dared to turn down his uninvited visitor's requests. However, the time came when fate freed him from the nix. One evening a bear trainer came to Frauendorf with his tamed bear and asked the miller for a night's lodging. The latter, a good-hearted man, did not refuse him. To keep it from harming anyone, the bear was chained up behind the table in the main room. Not long afterward the nix entered the mill with a catch of fish. With the miller's permission he cooked them, and then sat down next to the bear behind the table and began to eat them. The hungry bear could not resist the tempting smell of the tasty meal, and wasted no time in helping himself from the nix's plate. This angered the nix, who struck at the bear's paws with his spoon. The bear let this happen a few times, but when the blows became more painful, he became furious. He grabbed the nix and crushed him terribly, until the bear trainer jumped up and rescued the nearly dead nix from the beast's claws. The nix ran quickly out the door, jumped into the water, and was not seen again for a whole year. At the end of this time, the miller was one day working near his waterway, when the nix, wearing his red cap, suddenly emerged from the water, greeted the miller, then asked with a whining voice, ""Master miller, do you still have that large cat?"" The miller, fearing that the nix wanted to take up his regular visits again, quickly answered, ""Yes, she is lying behind the stove, and she has ninety-nine young ones!"" To this the nix replied, ""I'll never again come to your place!"" Then he disappeared beneath the water and was never seen there again.",Germany,"Source: Karl Haupt, ""Der Wassernix und der Bär in der Oelmühle bei Freuendorf,"" Sagenbuch der Lausitz, vol. 1 (Leipzig: Verlag von Wilhelm Engelmann, 1862), no. 49, pp. 52-53.",NA,Translated by D.

Bearskin,0361,Bearskin,"The foes of war were soon replaced by the enemies cold, thirst, and hunger. With nowhere to turn for help, he was about to surrender to the powers of despair, when without warning an awful spirit appeared before him. He offered the poor soldier great wealth, if he would but serve this uncanny master for seven years. Seeing no other escape from his misery, the soldier agreed. The terms of the pact were quickly stated: For seven years the soldier was to wear only a bearskin robe, both day and night. He was to say no prayers. Neither comb nor shears were to touch his hair and beard. He was not to wash, nor cut his nails, nor blow his nose, nor even wipe his behind. In return, the spirit would provide him with tobacco, food, drink, and an endless supply of money. The soldier, who by his very nature was not especially fond of either prayers or of cleanliness, entered into the agreement. He took lodgings in a village inn, and discovered soon enough that his great wealth was ample compensation for his strange looks and ill smell. A nobleman frequented this inn. Impressed by Bearskin's lavish and generous expenditures, he presented him with a proposal. ""I have three beautiful daughters,"" he said. ""If the terms are right, you may choose any one of them for a bride."" Bearskin named a sum that was acceptable to the nobleman, and the two set forth to the palace to make the selection. The two older daughters made no attempt to hide their repugnance of the strange suitor, but the youngest unhesitatingly accepted her father's will. Bearskin formalized the betrothal by removing a ring from his own finger and twisting it into two pieces. One piece he gave to his future bride; the other he kept. Saying that soon he would return, he departed. The seven years were nearly finished, so a short time later Bearskin did indeed come back for his bride. Now freshly bathed, neatly shorn, elegantly dressed, and riding in a luxurious carriage, he was a suitor worthy of a princess. Identifying himself with his half of the twisted ring, he claimed his bride. Beside themselves with envy, and furious that they had squandered their rights to this handsome nobleman, one of the bride's older sisters hanged herself from a tree and the other one drowned herself in a well. Thus the devil gained two souls for the one that he had lost. His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and asked them to support him until there was another war. The brothers, however, were hardhearted and said, ""What can we do with you? We have no work for you. See that you go and make a living for yourself."" The soldier had nothing left but his gun, so, putting it on his shoulder, he went forth into the world. He came to a large heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees. Filled with sorrow, he sat down beneath them and thought about his fate. ""I have no money,"" he thought, ""and the only trade I have learned is that of making war, and now that they have made peace they can no longer use me, so I see that I shall starve."" Suddenly he heard a rustling sound, and when he looked around, a strange man was standing before him. He wore a green jacket and looked quite stately, but he had a hideous horse's foot. ""I know what you are in need of,"" said the man. ""You shall have money and property, as much as you, with all your might, can squander away, but first I must know if you are fearless, so that I won't be giving away my money for nothing."" ""A soldier and fear -- how can those go together?"" he answered, ""You can put me to the test."" ""Very well,"" answered the man, ""look behind you."" The soldier turned around and saw a large growling bear running towards him. ""Aha,"" shouted the soldier, ""I'll tickle your nose until you lose your desire for growling."" Then taking aim at the bear, he shot it in the snout, and it fell down motionless. ""I see quite well,"" said the stranger, ""that you do not lack for courage, but there is one more condition that you will have to fulfill."" ""If it does not endanger my salvation,"" answered the soldier, who knew quite well who was standing before him. ""Otherwise I'll have nothing to do with it."" ""You'll see about that for yourself,"" answered Greenjacket. ""For the next seven years you are neither to wash yourself, nor comb your beard and hair, nor cut your nails, nor say the Lord's prayer. I will give you a jacket and a cloak, which you must wear during this time. If you die during these seven years, you are mine. If you stay alive, you are free, and rich as well, for all the rest of your life."" The soldier thought about his desperate situation, and having faced death so often before, he decided to risk it now as well, and he entered into the agreement. The devil took off his green jacket and gave it to the soldier, saying, ""Whenever you wear this jacket and reach into its pocket, you will find a handful of money."" Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, ""This shall be your cloak, and your bed as well, for you are to sleep on it, and you are not allowed to lie in any other bed. Because of your clothing you shall you be called Bearskin."" With that the devil disappeared. The soldier put on the jacket, immediately reached into the pocket, and found that the promise was really true. Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world. He did whatever he pleased, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm. During the first year his appearance was still acceptable, but during the second he looked like a monster. His hair covered nearly his entire face. His beard looked like a piece of coarse felt cloth. His fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if someone had planted cress on it, it would have grown. Everyone who saw him ran away. However, because everywhere he went he gave money to the poor to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and because he paid well for everything, he always found shelter. In the fourth year he arrived an inn. The innkeeper would not let him enter, refusing even to let him have a place in the stable because he was afraid he would frighten the horses. However, when Bearskin reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the innkeeper softened and gave him a room in an outbuilding. Bearskin, however, had to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name. One evening Bearskin was sitting alone, wishing with all his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud moaning in a neighboring room. He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door and saw an old man weeping bitterly and striking his hands together above his head. Bearskin went nearer, but the man jumped to his feet and tried to run away. At last, hearing a human voice, the man let Bearskin talk to him, and with friendly words Bearskin succeeded in getting the old man to reveal the cause of his grief. Slowly but surely the old man had lost his wealth, and now he and his daughters would have to starve. He was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper and was to be sent to prison. ""If that is your only problem,"" said Bearskin, ""I have money enough."" He called for the innkeeper and paid him, and then put a bag full of gold into the poor man's pocket. When the old man saw that he was freed from all his troubles he did not know how to show his gratitude. ""Come with me,"" he said to Bearskin. ""My daughters are all miracles of beauty. Choose one of them for your wife. When she hears what you have done for me she will not refuse you. You do look a little strange, to be sure, but she will put you in order again."" This pleased Bearskin well, and he went with the old man. When the oldest daughter saw him she was so terrified at his face that she screamed and ran away. The second one stood still and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, ""How can I accept a husband who no longer has a human form? The shaved bear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me far better. At least it was wearing a hussar's fur and white gloves. If ugliness were his only flaw, I could get used to him."" The youngest one, however, said, ""Father, dear, he must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble. If you promised him a bride for doing so, your word must be kept."" It was a pity that Bearskin's face was covered with dirt and hair, for otherwise they would have seen how his heart laughed within his body when he heard these words. He took a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half. He kept the other half himself. He then wrote his name inside her half, and her name inside his. He asked her to take good care of her piece. Then he took leave saying, ""I must wander about for three more years. If I do not return at that time you are free, for I shall be dead. But ask God to preserve my life."" The poor bride-to-be dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought about her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes. From her sisters she received nothing but contempt and scorn. ""Be careful,"" said the oldest. ""If you give him your hand, he will hit you with his claws."" ""Beware,"" said the second. ""Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a liking to you, he will eat you up."" ""You must always do what he wants you to,"" continued the oldest, ""or he will begin to growl."" And the second added, ""But the wedding will be merry, for bears dance well."" The bride-to-be said nothing and did not let them irritate her. Bearskin, however, traveled about the world from one place to another, did good wherever he could, and gave generously to the poor that they might pray for him. Finally, at dawn on the last day of the seven years, he went once more out to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of trees. Before long the wind began to howl, and the devil stood before him, looking at him angrily. He threw Bearskin's old jacket to him and demanded the return of his own green one. ""We haven't gotten that far yet,"" answered Bearskin. ""First of all you have to clean me up."" Whether the devil wanted to or not, he had to fetch water and wash off Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails. After this he looked like a brave soldier and was much better looking than he had ever been before. When the devil was safely gone Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He went into the town, purchased a splendid velvet jacket, seated himself in a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride's house. No one recognized him. The father took him for a distinguished colonel and led him into the room where his daughters were sitting. He was given a seat between the two oldest ones. They poured wine for him, served him the finest things to eat, and thought that they had never seen a more handsome man in all the world. The bride-to-be, however, sat across from him in her black dress without raising her eyes or speaking a word. Finally he asked the father if he would give him one of his daughters for a wife, whereupon the two oldest ones jumped up and ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses, for each of them thought that she was the chosen one. As soon as he was alone with his bride-to-be, the stranger brought out his half of the ring and dropped it into a glass of wine, which he handed across the table to her. She took the wine, but when she had drunk it and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to beat. She took the other half, which she wore on a ribbon around her neck, put them together, and saw that the two pieces matched perfectly. Then he said, ""I am your betrothed bridegroom, whom you saw as Bearskin. Through God's grace I have regained my human form and have become clean again."" He went to her, embraced her, and gave her a kiss. In the meantime the two sisters came back in full dress. When they saw that the youngest sister had received the handsome man, and heard that he was Bearskin, they ran out filled with anger and rage. One of them drowned herself in the well. The other hanged herself on a tree. That evening, someone knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was the devil in his green jacket, who said, ""You see, I now have two souls for the one of yours.""",Hans Jakob Christoph von Grimmelshausen Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,"Source: Abstracted from Hans Jakob Christoph von Grimmelshausen, ""Vom Ursprung des Namens Bärnhäuter"" (1670).

Bearskin,0361,Don Giovanni de la Fortuna,"One day he was walking down a broad road when he was stopped by a handsome man he had never seen before, who, little as Don Giovanni knew it, was the devil himself. ""Would you like to be rich,"" asked the devil, ""and to lead a pleasant life?"" ""Yes, of course I should,"" replied the Don. ""Well, here is a purse. Take it and say to it, 'Dear purse, give me some money,' and you will get as much as you can want. But the charm will only work if you promise to remain three years, three months, and three days without washing and without combing and without shaving your beard or changing your clothes. If you do all this faithfully, when the time is up you shall keep the purse for yourself, and I will let you off any other conditions."" Now Don Giovanni was a man who never troubled his head about the future. He did not once think how very uncomfortable he should be all those three years, but only that he should be able, by means of the purse, to have all sorts of things he had been obliged to do without. So he joyfully put the purse in his pocket and went on his way. He soon began to ask for money for the mere pleasure of it, and there was always as much as he needed. For a little while he even forgot to notice how dirty he was getting, but this did not last long, for his hair became matted with dirt and hung over his eyes, and his pilgrim's dress was a mass of horrible rags and tatters. He was in this state when, one morning, he happened to be passing a fine palace; and, as the sun was shining bright and warm, he sat down on the steps and tried to shake off some of the dust which he had picked up on the road. But in a few minutes a maid saw him, and said to her master, ""I pray you sir, to drive away that beggar who is sitting on the steps, or he will fill the whole house with his dirt."" So the master went out and called from some distance off, for he was really afraid to go near the man, ""You filthy beggar, leave my house at once!"" ""You need not be so rude,"" said Don Giovanni; ""I am not a beggar, and if I chose, I could force you and your wife to leave your house."" ""What is that you can do?"" laughed the gentleman. ""Will you sell me your house?"" asked Don Giovanni. ""I will buy it from you on the spot."" ""Oh, the dirty creature is quite mad!"" thought the gentleman. ""I shall just accept his offer for a joke."" And aloud he said, ""All right. Follow me, and we will go to a lawyer and get him to make a contract."" And Don Giovanni followed him, and an agreement was drawn up by which the house was to be sold at once, and a large sum of money paid down in eight days. Then the Don want to an inn, where he hired two rooms, and, standing in one of them, said to his purse, ""Dear purse, fill this room with gold."" And when the eight days were up it was so full you could not have put in another sovereign. When the owner of the house came to take away his money Don Giovanni led him into the room and said, ""There, just pocket what you want."" The gentleman stared with open mouth at the astonishing sight. But he had given his word to sell the house, so he took his money, as he was told, and went away with his wife to look for some place to live in. And Don Giovanni left the inn and dwelt in the beautiful rooms, where his rags and dirt looked sadly out of place. And every day these got worse and worse. By and by the fame of his riches reached the ears of the king, and, as he himself was always in need of money, he sent for Don Giovanni, as he wished to borrow a large sum. Don Giovanni readily agreed to lend him what he wanted, and sent next day a huge wagon laden with sacks of gold. ""Who can he be?"" thought the king to himself. ""Why, he is much richer than I!"" The king took as much as he had need of, then ordered the rest to be returned to Don Giovanni, who refused to receive it, saying, ""Tell his majesty I am much hurt at his proposal. I shall certainly not take back that handful of gold, and, if he declines to accept it, keep it yourself."" The servant departed and delivered the message, and the king wondered more than ever how anyone could be so rich. At last he spoke to the queen, ""Dear wife, this man has done me a great service, and has, besides, behaved like a gentleman in not allowing me to send back the money. I wish to give him the hand of our eldest daughter."" The queen was quite pleased at this idea, and again a messenger was sent to Don Giovanni, offering him the hand of the eldest princess. ""His majesty is too good,"" he replied. ""I can only humbly accept the honor."" The messenger took back this answer, but a second time returned with the request that Don Giovanni would present them with his picture, so that they might know what sort of a person to expect. But when it came, and the princess saw the horrible figure, she screamed out, ""What! Marry this dirty beggar? Never, never!"" ""Ah, child,"" answered the king, ""how could I ever guess that the rich Don Giovanni would ever look like that? But I have passed my royal word, and I cannot break it, so there is no help for you."" ""No, father, you may cut off my head, if you choose, but marry that horrible beggar -- I never will!"" And the queen took her part, and reproached her husband bitterly for wishing his daughter to marry a creature like that. Then the youngest daughter spoke, ""Dear father, do not look so sad. As you have given your word, I will marry Don Giovanni."" The king fell on her neck, and thanked her and kissed her, but the queen and the elder girl had nothing for her but laughs and jeers. So it was settled, and then the king bade one of his lords go to Don Giovanni and ask him when the wedding day was to be, so that the princess might make ready. ""Let it be in two months,"" answered Don Giovanni, for the time was nearly up that the devil had fixed, and he wanted a whole month to himself to wash off the dirt of the past three years. The very minute that the compact with the devil had come to an end his beard was shaved, his hair was cut, and his rags were burned, and day and night he lay in a bath of clear warm water. At length he felt he was clean again, and he put on splendid clothes, and hired a beautiful ship, and arrived in state at the king's palace. The whole of the royal family came down to the ship to receive him, and the whole way the queen and the elder princess teased the sister about the dirty husband she was going to have. But when they saw how handsome he really was their hearts were filled with envy and anger, so that their eyes were blinded, and they fell over into the sea and were drowned. And the youngest daughter rejoiced in the good luck that had come to her, and they had a splendid wedding when the days of mourning for her mother and sister were ended. Soon after, the old king died, and Don Giovanni became king. And he was rich and happy to the end of his days, for he loved his wife, and his purse always gave him money.",Sicily,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Pink Fairy Book (New York, London, and Bombay: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1897), pp. 356-360.","Lang's source: Laura Gonzenbach, Sicilianische Märchen: Aus dem Volksmund gesammelt, vol. 2 (Leipzig: Engelmann, 1870), no. 72, pp. 89-93.",NA
Bearskin,0361,Hell's Gatekeeper,"Now when people are very dirty and go about unwashed the evil one gains power over them. Many have painfully and bitterly experienced this, repenting too late. That is what happened to this boy. He suddenly disappeared. They saw neither hide nor hair of him, and no one knew what had become of him. Seven years passed since his disappearance, and he had nearly been forgotten when he suddenly showed up again. He had changed and aged so much that his closest acquaintances could scarcely recognize him. His skin color was now entirely black and his hair was very shaggy. Furthermore he was very quiet, saying almost nothing. But he did talk about one thing, especially to children. He told them that he had come under the power of the devil because of his refusal to wash, and that he had been forced to serve as a gatekeeper to Hell. Thus he had seen everyone who had gone through this fiery gate during this time, and there had been so many that he couldn't account for them all. Rich and noble, poor and lowly, men and women had to go past this gatekeeper, and he thanked God that he himself did not have to enter there and that his time of service was only seven years. He now resolved to wash himself thoroughly and never let himself become dirty. He faithfully kept this resolution, for he did not want to become Hell's gatekeeper once again and see the damned ones pass by him.",Austria,"Source: Ignaz Vincenz Zingerle and Joseph Zingerle, ""Der höllische Thorwartl,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Innsbruck: Verlag der Wagner'schen Buchhandlung, 1852), no. 7, pp. 41-42.",This cautionary tale presents a contrary view to the one presented by the other stories in this group.,Translated by D.

Bearskin,0361,Never-Wash,"As soon as he had spoken these words a little devil rose up at once in front of him and said, ""Hail, soldier, what do you wish? Did you just now not say that you wished to become one of our servants? Why, soldier, come up and be hired; we will pay you well."" ""What is the work?"" ""Oh, the work is easy enough: for fifteen years you must not shave, you must not have your hair cut, you must not blow your nose, and you must not change your garb. If you serve this service, then we will go to the king, who has three daughters. Two of them are mine, but the third shall be yours."" ""Very well,"" said the soldier, ""I will undertake the contract; but I require in return to get anything my soul hankers after."" ""It shall be so; be at peace; we shall not be in default."" ""Well, let it befall at once. Carry me at once into the capital and give me a pile of money; you know yourself how little of these goods a soldier ever gets."" So the little devil dashed into the lake, got out a pile of gold, and instantaneously carried the soldier into the great city, and all at once he was there! ""What a fool I have been!"" said the soldier. ""I have not done any service, no work, and I now have the money!"" So he took a room, never cut his hair, never shaved, never wiped his nose, never changed his garb, and he lived on and grew wealthy, so wealthy he did not know what to do with his money. What was he to do with his silver and gold? ""Oh, very well, I will start helping the poor; possibly they may pray for my soul."" So the soldier began distributing alms to the needy, to the right and to the left, and he still had money over, however much he gave away! His fame spread over the whole kingdom, came to the ears of all. So the soldier lived for fourteen years, and on the fifteenth year the tsar's exchequer gave out. So he summoned the soldier. So the soldier came to him unwashed, unshaved, uncombed, with his nose unwiped and his dress unchanged. ""Health, your majesty!"" ""Listen, soldier. You, they say, are good to all folks; will you lend me some money? I have not enough to pay my troops. If you will I will make you a general at once."" ""No, your Majesty, I do not wish to be a general; but if you will do me a favor, give me one of your daughters as my wife, and you shall have as much money as you wish for the Treasury."" So the king began to think. He was very fond of his daughters, but still he could not do anything whatsoever without money. ""Well,"" he said, ""I agree. Have a portrait taken of yourself; I will show it to my daughters and ask which of them will take you."" So the soldier returned, had the portrait painted, which was feature for feature, unshaved, unwashed, uncombed, his nose unwiped, and in his old garb, and sent it to the tsar. Now, the tsar had three daughters, and the father summoned them and showed them the soldier's portrait. He said to the eldest, ""Will you go and marry him? He will redeem me from very great embarrassment."" The tsarevna saw what a monstrous animal had been painted, with tangled hair, uncut nails and unwiped nose. ""I certainly won't!"" she said, "" I would sooner go to the devil."" And from somewhere or other the devil appeared, stood behind her with pen and paper, heard what she said, and entered her soul on his register. Then the father asked the next daughter, ""Will you go and marry the soldier? "" ""What! I would rather remain a maiden; I would rather tie myself up with the devil than go with him."" So the devil went and inscribed her soul as well. Then the father asked his youngest daughter, and she answered, ""Evidently this must be my lot. I will go and marry him and see what God shall give."" Then the tsar was very blithe at this, and he went and told the soldier to make ready for the betrothal, and he sent him twelve carts to carry the money away. Then the soldier made use of his devil. ""There are twelve carts; pile them all high at once with gold."" So the devil ran into the lake and the unholy ones set to work. Some of them brought up one sack, some two, and they soon filled the carts and sent them to the tsar, into his palace. Then the tsar looked, and now summoned the soldier to him every day, sat with him at one table, and ate and drank with him. When they got ready for the marriage the term of fifteen years was over. So he called the little devil and said, ""Now my service is over. Turn me into a youth."" So the devil cut him up into little bits, threw them into a cauldron, and began to brew him -- brewed him, washed him and collected all his bones, one by one, in the proper way, every bone with every bone, every joint with every joint, every nerve with every nerve. Then he sprinkled them with the water of life, and the soldier arose, such a fine young man as no tale can tell and no pen can write. He then married the youngest tsarevna, and they began to live a merry life of good. I was at the wedding. I drank mead and beer. They also had wine, and I drank it to the very dregs. But the little devil ran back into the lake, for his elder hauled him over the coals to answer for what he had done with the soldier. ""He has served out his period faithfully and honorably: he has never once shaved himself, nor cut his hair, nor wiped his nose, nor changed his clothes."" Then the elder was very angry. He said, ""In fifteen years you were not able to corrupt the soldier! Was all the money given in vain? What sort of a devil will you be after this?"" And he had him thrown into the burning pitch. ""Oh no, please, grandfather,"" said the grandson, "" I have lost the soldier's soul, but I have gained two others."" "" What?"" ""Look: the soldier thought of marrying a tsarevna; the two elder daughters both declined and said they would rather marry a devil than the soldier. So there they are, and they belong to us."" So the grandfather devil approved what the grandson imp had done, and set him free. ""Yes,"" he said, ""you know your business very well indeed.""",Russia,"Source: Alexander Afanasyev, Russian Folk-Tales, translated by Leonard A. Magnus (New York: E. P.

Bearskin,0361,The Devil as Partner,"The innkeeper got wind of this, and one evening he said, ""My good friend, you are now well rested. Be so good as to be on your way early in the morning. Here is the bill for what you owe me."" This brought both chills and fever to journeyman, who asked the innkeeper if he at least could not wait until tomorrow to be paid. ""Tomorrow,"" he said, ""is one more day."" ""Good,"" said the innkeeper, ""but be careful that you don't end up in the Black Tower Inn. Around here that's where folks stay who eat and drink more than their purses will cover."" As soon as the innkeeper had left, the journeyman threw himself onto his bed, but fear and worry kept him awake the entire night. Then suddenly a black figure approached his bed, and the journeyman recognized him as the devil for sure. He said, ""Fear not, my dear companion, if you'll provide the sausage, I'll bring the drinks. Lend me a hand, and I'll help you out of your predicament."" ""Doing what?"" asked the journeyman. ""Just stay here in this inn for seven years,"" said the devil. ""I'll keep you out of debt and provide you with everything you need. Afterward you'll be even better off, and you'll have money like the leaves on trees. In return for this you must neither wash yourself, nor comb your hair, nor cut your hair or nails."" ""That job is worth the pay,"" thought the journeyman, and he entered the agreement without further hesitation. When the innkeeper appeared the next morning, the journeyman paid him every last penny that was due, and he still had a good surplus for future bills. The journeyman stayed at the inn for years and days, spending money as though it were sand on the beach. But he became as wild as the night, and no one wanted to look at him. One fine morning a merchant who lived nearby came to the inn. He had three strikingly beautiful daughters. He had come to tell his sorrows to the innkeeper, for he had badly miscalculated in a business deal and did not know how he was going to get out of the difficulty. ""Listen,"" said the innkeeper. ""There's help for you here. A strange fellow has been living upstairs in my rented room for more than six years now. He lets himself go completely, and looks as bad as sin, but he has money like hay, and is a free-spender. Give him a try. Anyway, I've long noticed that he often stares at your house. Who knows, perhaps he's got his eye on one of your daughters. This advice made good sense to the merchant. He went upstairs to the journeyman, and the two of them soon struck a deal. The journeyman would pay the merchant's debts, and the merchant would give one of his daughters to the journeyman in marriage. However, when they went to the three daughters, and the father explained the situation to them, the oldest one ran away, crying out, ""Phooey, father! What sort of a monster is this that you've brought home? I'd sooner jump into water than to marry him."" The second daughter did no better. She cried out, ""Phooey, father! What sort of a creature is this that you've brought home? I'd sooner hang myself than to marry him."" But the third and youngest daughter said, ""He must be a good man, father, if he wants to rescue you. I'll take him."" She turned her eyes to the floor and did not look at him, but he took a great liking to her, and the wedding was set. The seven years that the devil had demanded were now past. On the morning of the wedding day a splendid coach, sparkling with gold and precious stones, drove up to the merchant's house. Out jumped the journeyman, who had now become a fine young nobleman. The bride breathed a sigh of relief, and there was endless rejoicing. The wedding party went to the church in a long procession, for the merchant and the innkeeper had invited all their relatives. Only the happy bride's two older sisters did not participate. They angrily took their own lives, the one at the end of a rope, the other in water. And as the bridegroom was leaving the church, he saw the devil again, the first time in seven years. He was sitting on a roof, laughing with satisfaction, and saying:",Switzerland,"Source: Otto Sutermeister, ""Der Teufel als Schwager,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen aus der Schweiz (Aarau: Sauerländer, 1873), no. 27, pp. 83-86.",NA,Translated by D.

Bearskin,0361,The King's Tabernacle,"K___ Park, August 4th, 1828. I rode first to the small town of St. Asaph to look at the cathedral, which is adorned with a beautiful window of modern painted glass. Many coats of arms were extremely well executed, and the artist had the good sense to avoid the cominon error of endeavouring to represent objects not suited to his art, which requires masses of colour and no delicate and floating shades. To obtain a more perfect knowledge of the country, I ascended the tower. At a distance of about twelve miles I espied a church-like building on the summit of a high mountain, and asked the clerk what it was. He replied, in broken English, that it was ""the king's tabernacle,"" and that whoever would pass seven years without washing himself, cutting his nails, or shaving his beard, would be allowed to live there; and at the expiration of the seventh year he would have a right to go to London, where the king must give him a pension and make him a ""gentleman."" The man believed this wild story implicitly, aud swore to its truth: ""Voila ce que c'est que la foi [That is what faith is]."" I inquired afterwards the true state of the affair, and heard the origin of this history; namely, that the building was erected by the province, or ""county,"" to commemorate the jubilee of the last king's reign, and had stood empty ever since; but that a wag had advertised a considerable reward in the newspapers, to any man who would fulfil the above-named conditions.

Bearskin,0361,The Reward of Kindness,"In a certain town there once lived a couple who had never had a child. They had been married for nearly five years, and were very anxious for a son. The name of the wife was Clara; and of the man, Philip. One cloudy night in December, while they were talking by the window of their house, Clara said to her husband that she was going to pray the novena [nine consecutive days of praying], so that heaven would give them a child. ""I would even let my son serve the devil, if he would but give us a son!"" As her husband was willing that she should pray the novena, Clara began the next day her fervent devotions to the Virgin Mary. She went to church every afternoon for nine days. She carried a small prayer book with her, and prayed until six o'clock every evening. At last she finished her novenario, but no child was born to them, and the couple was disappointed. A month had passed, when, to their great happiness, Clara gave birth to a son. The child they nicknamed Idó. Idó was greatly cherished by his parents, for he was their only child; but he did not care much to stay at home. He early began to show a fondness for travelling abroad, and was always to be found in the dense woods on the outskirts of the town. One afternoon, when the family was gathered together around a small table, talking, a knock was heard at the door. ""Come in!"" said Philip. ""No, I just want to talk with your wife,"" answered a hoarse voice from without. Clara, trembling, opened the door, and, to her great surprise, she saw standing there a man who looked like a bear. ""A devil, a devil!"" she exclaimed. But the devil pacified her, and said, ""Clara, I have come here to get your son you promised me a long time ago. Now that the day has come when your son can be of some service to me, will you deny your promise?"" Clara could make no reply at first. She merely called her son; and when he came, she said to the devil, ""Here is my son. Take him, since he is yours."" Idó, who was at this time about seventeen years old, was not frightened by the devil. ""Come,"" said the devil, ""and be my follower!"" At first Idó refused. But he finally consented to go, because of his mother's promise. The devil now took Idó to his cave, far away outside the town. He tried in many ways to tempt Idó, but was unable to do so, because Idó was a youth of strong character. Finally the devil decided to exchange clothes with him. Idó was obliged to put on the bear-like clothes of the devil and to give him his own soldier suit. Then the devil produced a large bag full of money, and said to Idó, ""Take this money and go traveling about the world for seven years. If you live to the end of that time, and spend this money only in doing good, I will set you free. If, however, you spend the money extravagantly, you will have to go to hell with me."" When had said these words, he disappeared. Idó now began his wanderings from town to town. Whenever people saw him, they were afraid of him, and would refuse to give him shelter; but Idó would give them money from his bag, and then they would gather about him and be kind to him. After many years he happened to come to a town where he saw an old woman summoned before a court of justice. She was accused of owing a sum of money, but was unable to pay her debt and the fine imposed on her. When Idó paid her fine for her and thus released her from prison, the woman could hardly express her gratitude. As most of the other people about were afraid of Idó and he had no place to sleep, this woman decided to take him home with her. Now, this old woman had three daughters. When she reached home with the bear-like man, she called her eldest daughter, and said, ""Now, my daughter, here is a man who delivered me from prison. As I can do nothing to reward him for his great kindness, I want you to take him for your husband."" The daughter replied, ""Mother, why have you brought this ugly man here? No, I cannot marry him. I can find a better husband."" On hearing this harsh reply, the mother could not say a word. She called her second daughter, and explained her wishes to her; but the younger daughter refused, just as her sister had refused, and she made fun of the man. The mother was very much disappointed, but she was unable to persuade her daughters to marry her benefactor. Finally she determined to try her youngest daughter. When the daughter heard her mother's request, she said, ""Mother, if to have me marry this man is the only way by which you can repay him for his kindness, I'll gladly marry him."" The mother was very much pleased, but the two older daughters were very angry with their sister. The mother told the man of the decision of her youngest daughter, and a contract was signed between them. But before they were married, the bear-like man asked permission from the girl to be absent for one more year to finish his duty. She consented to his going, and gave him half her ring as a memento. At the end of the year, which was the last of his seven years' wandering, the bear-like man went to the devil, and told him that he had finished his duty. The devil said, ""You have beaten me. Now that you have performed your seven years' wandering, and have spent the money honestly, let us exchange clothes again!"" So the man received back his soldier-like suit, which made him look like a knight, and the devil took back his bearskin. Then the man returned to Clara's house. When his arrival was announced to the family, the two older daughters dressed themselves in their best, for they thought that he was a suitor come to see them. But when the man showed the ring and asked for the hand of Clara's youngest daughter, the two nearly died with vexation, while the youngest daughter was very happy.",Philippines,"Source: Dean S.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,Beauty and the Beast,"There was once a merchant that had three daughters, and he loved them better than himself. Now it happened that he had to go a long journey to buy some goods, and when he was just starting he said to them, ""What shall I bring you back, my dears?"" And the eldest daughter asked to have a necklace; and the second daughter wished to have a gold chain; but the youngest daughter said, ""Bring back yourself, papa, and that is what I want the most."" ""Nonsense, child,"" said her father, ""you must say something that I may remember to bring back for you."" ""So,"" she said, ""then bring me back a rose, father."" Well, the merchant went on his journey and did his business and bought a pearl necklace for his eldest daughter, and a gold chain for his second daughter; but he knew it was no use getting a rose for the youngest while he was so far away because it would fade before he got home. So he made up his mind he would get a rose for her the day he got near his house. When all his merchanting was done he rode off home and forgot all about the rose till he was near his house; then he suddenly remembered what he had promised his youngest daughter, and looked about to see if he could find a rose. Near where he had stopped he saw a great garden, and getting off his horse he wandered about in it till he found a lovely rosebush; and he plucked the most beautiful rose he could see on it. At that moment he heard a crash like thunder, and looking around he saw a huge monster -- two tusks in his mouth and fiery eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back. ""Mortal,"" said the beast, ""who told you you might pluck my roses?"" ""Please, sir,"" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life, ""I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment, and then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission."" ""Thieving is thieving,"" said the beast, ""whether it be a rose or a diamond; your life is forfeit."" The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but him to support them. ""Well, mortal, well,"" said the beast, ""I grant your life on one condition: Seven days from now you must bring this youngest daughter of yours, for whose sake you have broken into my garden, and leave her here in your stead. Otherwise swear that you will return and place yourself at my disposal."" So the merchant swore, and taking his rose mounted his horse and rode home. As soon as he got into his house his daughters came rushing round him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way, and soon he gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the chain to his second daughter, and then he gave the rose to his youngest, and as he gave it he sighed. ""Oh, thank you, father,"" they all cried. But the youngest said, ""Why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?"" ""Later on I will tell you,"" said the merchant. So for several days they lived happily together, though the merchant wandered about gloomy and sad, and nothing his daughters could do would cheer him up till at last he took his youngest daughter aside and said to her, ""Bella, do you love your father?"" ""Of course I do, father, of course I do."" ""Well, now you have a chance of showing it""; and then he told her of all that had occurred with the beast when he got the rose for her. Bella was very sad, as you can well think, and then she said, ""Oh, father, it was all on account of me that you fell into the power of this beast; so I will go with you to him; perhaps he will do me no harm; but even if he does -- better harm to me than evil to my dear father."" So next day the merchant took Bella behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the dwelling of the beast. And when he got there and they alighted from his horse the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there! Nothing. So they went up the steps and went through the hall, and went into the dining room, and there they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and napery, with plenty to eat upon it. So they waited and they waited, thinking that the owner of the house would appear, till at last the merchant said, ""Let's sit down and see what will happen then."" And when they sat down invisible hands passed them things to eat and to drink, and they ate and drank to their heart's content. And when they arose from the table it arose too and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants. Suddenly there appeared before them the beast who said to the merchant, ""Is this your youngest daughter?"" And when he had said that it was, he said, ""Is she willing to stop here with me?"" And then he looked at Bella who said, in a trembling voice, ""Yes, sir."" ""Well, no harm shall befall you."" With that he led the merchant down to his horse and told him he might come that day each week to visit his daughter. Then the beast returned to Bella and said to her, ""This house with all that therein is is yours; if you desire aught, clap your hands and say the word and it shall be brought unto you."" And with that he made a sort of bow and went away. So Bella lived on in the home with the beast and was waited on by invisible servants and had whatever she liked to eat and to drink; but she soon got tired of the solitude and, next day, when the beast came to her, though he looked so terrible, she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. So they spoke together about the garden and about the house and about her father's business and about all manner of things, so that Bella lost altogether her fear of the beast. Shortly afterwards her father came to see her and found her quite happy, and he felt much less dread of her fate at the hands of the beast. So it went on for many days, Bella seeing and talking to the beast every day, till she got quite to like him, until one day the beast did not come at his usual time, just after the midday meal, and Bella quite missed him. So she wandered about the garden trying to find him, calling out his name, but received no reply. At last she came to the rosebush from which her father had plucked the rose, and there, under it, what do you think she saw! There was the beast lying huddled up without any life or motion. Then Bella was sorry indeed and remembered all the kindness that the beast had shown her; and she threw herself down by it and said, ""Oh, Beast, Beast, why did you die? I was getting to love you so much."" No sooner had she said this than the hide of the beast split in two and out came the most handsome young prince who told her that he had been enchanted by a magician and that he could not recover his natural form unless a maiden should, of her own accord, declare that she loved him. Thereupon the prince sent for the merchant and his daughters, and he was married to Bella, and they all lived happy together ever afterwards. The king kept going from fair to fair, and from feast to feast, and from everywhere he used to bring something for the two eldest daughters. One day, when he was going to a feast, he said to his youngest daughter, ""I never bring anything home for you; tell me then what you want and you shall have it."" She said to her father, ""And I do not want anything."" ""Yes, yes, I am going to bring you something."" ""Very well then, bring me a flower."" He goes off, and is busy buying and buying; for one a hat, for the other a beautiful piece of stuff for a dress, and for the first again a shawl; and he was returning home, when in passing before a beautiful castle, he sees a garden quite full of flowers, and he says to himself, ""What! I was going home without a flower for my daughter; here I shall have plenty of them."" He takes some then, and as soon, as he has done so, a voice says to him, ""Who gave you permission to take that flower? As you have three daughters, if you do not bring me one of them before the year be finished, you shall be burnt wherever you are -- you, and your whole kingdom."" The king goes off home. He gives his elder daughters their presents, and her nosegay to the youngest. She thanks her father. After a certain time this king became sad. His eldest daughter said to him, ""What is the matter with you ?"" He says to her, ""If one of my daughters will not go to such a spot before the end of the year, I shall be burned."" His eldest daughter answers him, ""Be burned if you like; as for me, I shall not go. I have no wish at all to go there. Settle it with the others."" The second also asks him, ""You seem very sad, papa; what is the matter with you?"" He told her how he is bound to send one of his daughters to such a place before the end of the year, otherwise he should be burned. This one too says to him, ""Manage your own business as you like, but do not reckon upon me."" The youngest, after some days, said to him, ""What is the matter with you, my father, that you are so sad? Has someone done you some hurt?"" He said to her, ""When I went to get your nosegay, a voice said to me, 'I must have one of your daughters before the year be completed,' and now I do not knew what I must do. It told me that I shall be burned."" This daughter said to him, ""My father, do not be troubled about it. I will go."" And she sets out immediately in a carriage. She arrives at the castle and goes in, and she hears music and sounds of rejoicing everywhere, and yet she did not see anyone. She finds her chocolate ready (in the morning), and her dinner the same. She goes to bed, and still she does not see anyone. The next morning a voice says to her, ""Shut your eyes; I wish to place my head on your knees for a moment."" ""Come, come; I am not afraid."" There appears then an enormous serpent. Without intending it, the young lady could not help giving a little shudder. An instant after the serpent went away; and the young lady lived very happily, without lacking anything. One day the voice asked her if she did not wish to go home. She answers, ""I am very happy here. I have no longing for it."" ""Yes, if you like, you may go for three days."" He gives her a ring, and says to her, ""If that changes colour, I shall be ill, and if it turns to blood, I shall be in great misery."" The young lady sets out for her father's house. Her father was very glad (to see her). Her sisters said to her, ""You must be happy there. You are prettier than you were before. With whom do you live there?"" She told them, ""With a serpent."" They would not believe her. The three days flew by like a dream, and she forgot her serpent. The fourth day she looked at her ring, and she saw that it was changed. She rubs it with her finger, and it begins to bleed. Seeing that she goes running to her father, and says to him that she is going. She arrives at the castle, and finds everything sad. The music will not play -- everything was shut up. She called the serpent (his name was Azor, and hers Fifine). She kept on calling and crying out to him, but Azor appeared nowhere. After having searched the whole house, after having taken off her shoes, she goes to the garden, and there too she cries out. She finds a corner of the earth in the garden quite frozen, and immediately she makes a great fire over this spot, and there Azor comes out, and he says to her, ""You had forgotten me, then. If you had not made this fire, it would have been all up with me."" Fifine said to him, ""Yes, I had forgotten you, but the ring made me think of you."" Azor said to her, ""I knew what was going to happen; that is why I gave you the ring."" And coming into the house, she finds it as before, all full of rejoicings -- the music was playing on all sides. Some days after that Azor said to her, ""You must marry me."" Fifine gives no answer. He asks her again like that three times, and still she remained silent, silent. The whole house becomes sad again. She has no more her meals ready. Again Azor asks her if she will marry him. Still she does not answer, and she remains like that in darkness several days without eating anything, and she said to herself, ""Whatever it shall cost me I must say yes."" When the serpent asks her again, ""Will you marry me?"" she answers, ""Not with the serpent, but with the man."" As soon as she had said that the music begins as before. Azor says to her that she must go to her father's house and get all things ready that are necessary, and they will marry the next day. The young lady goes as he had told her. She says to her father that she is going to be married to the serpent tomorrow, (and asks him) if he will prepare everything for that. The father consents, but he is vexed. Her sisters, too, ask her whom she is going to marry, and they are astounded at hearing that it is with a serpent. Fifine goes back again, and Azor says to her, ""Which would you prefer, from the house to the church, serpent, or from the church to the house, serpent?"" Fifine says to him, ""From the house to the church, serpent."" Azor says to her, ""I, too."" A beautiful carriage comes to the door. The serpent gets in, and Fifine places herself at his side, and when they arrive at the king's house the serpent says to her, ""Shut the doors and the curtains, that nobody may see."" Fifine says to him, ""But they will see you as you get down."" ""No matter; shut them all the same."" She goes to her father. Her father comes with all his court to fetch the serpent. He opens the door, and who is astonished ? Why, everybody. Instead of a serpent there is a charming young man; and they all go to the church. When they come out there is a grand dinner at the king's, but the bridegroom says to his wife, ""Today we must not make a feast at all. We have a great business to do in the house; we will come another day for the feast."" She told that to her father, and they go on to their house. When they are come there her husband brings her in a large basket a serpent's skin, and says to her, ""You will make a great fire, and when you hear the first stroke of midnight you will throw this serpent's skin into the fire. That must be burnt up, and you must throw the ashes out of window before the last stroke of twelve has ceased striking. If you do not do that I shall be wretched forever."" The lady says to him, ""Certainly; I will do everything that I can to succeed."" She begins before midnight to make the fire. As soon as she heard the first stroke she throws the serpent's skin on the fire, and takes two spits and stirs the fire, and moves about the skin and burns it, till ten strokes have gone. Then she takes a shovel, and throws the ashes outside as the last twelfth stroke is ending. Then a terrible voice says, ""I curse your cleverness, and what you have just done."" At the same time her husband comes in. He did not know where he was for joy. He kisses her, and does not know how to tell his wife what great good she has done him. ""Now I do not fear anything. If you had not done as I told you, I should have been enchanted for twenty-one years more. Now it is all over, and we will go at our ease tomorrow to your father's house for the wedding feast."" They go the next day and enjoy themselves very much. They return to their palace to take away the handsomest things, because they did not wish to stop any more in that corner of the mountain. They load all their valuable things in carts and waggons, and go to live with the king. This young lady has four children, two boys and two girls, and as her sisters were very jealous of her, their father sent them out of the house. The king gave his crown to his son-in-law, who was already a son of a king. As they had lived well, they died well too.",Joseph Jacobs Basque,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, Europa's Fairy Book [also published under the title European Folk and Fairy Tales] (New York: G. P.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,Beauty and the Horse,"So the merchant went away, and in due time arrived at the place where the tradesman of whom he had heard the bad news was living. But instead of obtaining money, as he hoped, he was kicked and beaten so violently that it seems a great wonder he came away without losing his life. Of course he had now nothing to do but return, so he mounted his horse and turned homeward. Towards evening he unfortunately lost his way, and when it became quite dark he knew no better than to ride in the direction of a light which was shining from a distance. At length he reached a beautiful little palace, but although it was lighted, there seemed to be no one at home. After a while he found a shelter and food for his horse -- pure oats, and nothing else. The animal might well dance for joy, for both man and beast were well-nigh exhausted from the long ride. When the horse had been provided for, the master stepped into the palace. There a light was burning, and a table was laid for one person, but no one was to be seen. As the merchant was tired, he sat down without invitation, and ate a hearty supper. A fine bed was there, too, and when he had eaten enough he stretched himself among the pillows and enjoyed a good night's rest. The next morning everything appeared as on the evening before. The horse was well supplied, and as breakfast was ready on the table, the merchant seated himself, doing justice to the good meal. At he was now ready to leave, he thought it might be well to look over the premises, and glancing into the garden he perceived some exquisite flowers. He went down, intending to carry some of them home with him as a present for Beauty; but no sooner had he touched them than a horse came running towards him as fast as it could trot, saying, ""You thoughtless man; I was good to you last night, I gave you shelter and provisions, and now you would even take with you the most beautiful flowers in my garden."" The merchant immediately begged pardon, saying that he had intended the flowers as a gift for Beauty, his daughter. ""Have you several daughters?"" asked the horse. ""Yes, I have three, and Beauty is the youngest one,"" he replied. ""Now you must promise me,"" said the horse, ""that you will give me the daughter whose name is Beauty; if you refuse, I will take your life."" Well, the merchant did not wish to lose his life, so he promised to bring his daughter to the palace, whereupon the horse disappeared among the trees, and the man rode home. As soon as he reached his house, the two older daughters came out and asked him for the fine things which they were expecting. But Beauty came and bid him welcome. He produced the flowers and gave them to her, saying, ""These are for you, but they cost your life,"" and he then told her how he had been obliged to make the fatal promise to the horse, in order to save his life. Beauty at once said, ""I am willing to follow you, father, and am always glad to help you."" They started on their journey, and soon arrived at the palace. As before, no one was to be seen, but the merchant found food for his horses and a good stable The table was also laid for two persons, and there were two beds. Having done justice to the supper, father and daughter retired and slept soundly. When they awoke the next morning, they found breakfast ready for both, ate heartily, and having exchanged many loving and tender words, they separated, the father riding away. We will let him proceed, and see what occurred at the palace. Shortly before dinnertime the horse arrived. He came into the room and said, ""Welcome, Beauty!"" She did not feel very glad, and had all she could do in keeping her tears back. ""You shall do nothing but walk around in these rooms and in the garden,"" continued the horse. ""Your meals are provided for. I shall come home every day at noon; at other times you must not expect me."" Time passed, and Beauty felt so lonely that she often longed for noon, when the horse came home, and she could talk with him. She gradually came to look at him more and more kindly; but one thing caused her great distress, namely, that she had no news from her father. One day she mentioned this to the horse. ""Yes,"" said he, ""I understand that very well. In the large room you will find a mirror in which you can see all that you are thinking of."" She was happy to learn this, and went straight into the room where the mirror was hanging. As soon as she thought of her father, her old home was visible in the glass, and she noticed how he was sitting in his chair with a sorrowful expression upon his countenance, while his two daughters were singing and dancing. Beauty felt sorry over this state of affairs, and the next day she told the horse what she had seen. ""Your father is sorry, I suppose,"" said the horse, "" because he has lost you. He will soon feel better, however."" But on the next day, when Beauty consulted the mirror, her father looked pale and ill, like one who is deadly sick; both of her sisters were dressed for a ball, and neither of them seemed to care for the weak man. Beauty burst into tears, and when the horse came home, asking what ailed her, she told him of the bad state of affairs, wishing that he would allow her to return and nurse her poor father during his illness. ""If you will promise to come back,"" said the horse, ""you may return and stay for three days; but under no condition must you break your word."" Beauty told him she would come back in three days. ""Tonight,"" resumed the horse, ""before going to bed, you must place the mirror under your pillow, saying, 'I wish to be home tomorrow.' Then your wish will be fulfilled. When you desire to return, you must do likewise."" The next morning, when Beauty awoke, she was at her old home. Her father became so glad to see her again that he at once felt a great deal better. She cared so well for him that the next day he was able to be up, and on the third day he was almost well. As he wished her to stay with him a few days longer, she complied, thinking that no harm would come from it. On the third day after, however, when she looked into the mirror, she saw the horse stretched on the ground in front of the bench which was her favorite seat in the garden. She now felt that it would be impossible for her to remain longer, hence in the evening, before going to bed, she placed the mirror under her pillow, saying: ""I wish to be at the palace tomorrow morning."" She promptly awoke in the palace the following morning, and hurrying into the garden she found the horse so very sick that he could not stand on his legs. Beauty knelt down and asked him to forgive her for staying away longer than she had promised. The horse asked her if she could not persuade herself to stay with him all her life, but she answered that it would seem very singular to live with a horse all her lifetime. The poor animal now sighed so deeply that she took pity on him and said, fearing that he might die then and there, that she would always stay with him and never leave him. As soon as she had made this promise, the horse vanished, and a beautiful young prince stood before her. He seized her hand and asked whether she was not sorry for the promise she had made. No, she said, she would rather stay with him now than when he was in the shape of a horse. He now told her that both he and the whole land had been enchanted by his wicked stepmother, who had converted him into a horse, and told him that only when a beautiful young girl would promise to stay with him, in his altered shape, would the enchantment be over. He wanted to marry Beauty, and live in the palace which belonged to him. So they sent for her father to take up his residence with them, and now the marriage was performed and celebrated in a splendid manner. They lived long and happily together, the prince and his Beauty.",Denmark,"Source: J.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,Little Broomstick,"There was once a merchant who had three daughters. The two older ones were proud and haughty. The younger one, however, was well behaved and modest, although her beauty greatly surpassed that of her sisters. She dressed simply, and thus unconsciously enhanced her beauty more than her sisters were able to do with the most expensive clothing and jewelry. Nettchen, that was the name of the merchant's youngest daughter, had a dear girlfriend who was very poor, but equally beautiful and virtuous. She was a broom binder's daughter, and was for this reason was called Little Broomstick by young and old alike. Both girls were of one heart and one soul. They entrusted one another with their little secrets, and between them all class distinctions fell by the wayside. This angered the older sisters greatly, but Nettchen let them scold, and loved her Little Broomstick nonetheless. Once the merchant was planning a long journey, although the season was already very advanced. He asked his daughters if they had a wish as to what he should bring home to them. The oldest one said, ""Bring me a golden necklace!"" The second, ""Bring me a pair of earrings that are so beautiful that all women be envious of me because of them!"" The youngest said that she had no wish, because her father, in his goodness, had already given her everything. But the merchant insisted, so she answered with a smile, ""Then bring me three roses growing on one stem."" She was convinced that her father would not be able to find such a present in the middle of winter. He kissed her for her modesty and set forth on his journey. He was on his way home when he remembered the presents that he was supposed to get for his daughters. He soon found a golden necklace and a pair of splendid earrings, but not so the three roses for Nettchen. The father had just decided to buy some other valuable present for his darling, when suddenly -- to his surprise -- he came upon a green area. He stepped through a wide gateway and found himself in a large, blossoming garden adjacent to a splendid castle. Outside everything was covered with snow, but in the garden the trees were in blossom, nightingales were singing in the bushes, and finally he even saw a blossoming rosebush, and on one of its branches were three of the most beautiful half-open buds. Elated, he thought that now he would be able to fulfill Nettchen's wish, and he broke off the branch. He had scarcely done so when an enormous beast with a long ugly snout, ears hanging down, and a shaggy coat and tail appeared before him and laid his long sharp claws on his shoulder. The merchant was deathly frightened, and even worse when the beast began to speak, threatening him with death for his misdeed. The merchant begged, telling him why he wanted the roses, whereupon the beast answered, ""Your youngest daughter must be a true pearl of her sex. Very well, if you will promise to give her to me as a wife in seven months, then you shall live and return to your people."" As terrified as the merchant was at this proposal, his fear nevertheless led him to make the promise, thinking that he would be able to trick the monster. The merchant returned to his people and distributed the presents. However, he was sad and melancholy, and they noticed that he was carrying a great burden in his heart. Nettchen asked him to tell her what was troubling him, but he only gave her excuses. He told the secret only to the two older daughters, who wickedly took pleasure in the situation. So that the father could keep his eyes on her, Nettchen was almost never allowed to leave the house. Only Little Broomstick came to visit her from time to time. One day -- the seventh month had just passed -- she and Little Broomstick were again together when a carriage stopped before the house. A servant, gesturing silently, handed a note to the merchant. On it were written the words, ""Fulfill your promise!"" The merchant was terrified, but he collected himself and asked Little Broomstick to come to him. The girl came, expecting nothing bad. The merchant pointed at her. She was lifted into the carriage, and away they went in a thundering gallop. However, the beast recognized the deception as soon as Little Broomstick was brought before him, and he ordered the girl to go home immediately and bring back the right one. The carriage stopped again before the merchant's house, and when Little Broomstick stepped out, Nettchen fell around her neck with friendly greetings. But then she was picked up and shoved into the carriage, which drove away with its booty as fast as an arrow. Nettchen was very frightened, but she soon collected herself. Inside the strange, beautiful castle she was received with honor, although with silent gestures, and she no longer felt concerned. Silent servants brought her the most delicious things to eat and showed her to a bedroom, where a blinding white canopy bed invited her to rest. After saying her prayers, she surrendered to the arms of sleep. When she awoke she saw to her fright that a disgusting shaggy monster lay next to her. But it was lying there still and quiet, so she left it alone. Then it left, and she had time to think about her adventure. The ugly beast gradually became her sleeping companion, and she grew less and less afraid of him. He cuddled up to her, and she stroked his shaggy coat and even allowed him to touch her lips with his long, cold snout. This had gone on for four weeks when one night the beast did not come to her. Nettchen could not sleep for worry and concern about what might have happened to the beast, whom she had become quite fond of. The next morning she was walking in the garden when she saw the beast lying all stretched out on the bank of a pond that served as a bath. He did not move a limb and showed every sign of being dead. A bitter pain penetrated her breast, and she cried over the death of the poor beast. But her tears had scarcely started to flow when the monster was transformed into a handsome youth. He stood up before her, pressed her hand to his breast, and said, ""You have redeemed me from a terrible curse. My father wanted me to marry a woman whom I did not love. I refused steadfastly, and in his anger, my father had a sorceress transform me into a monster. The transformation was to last until an innocent virgin would fall in love with me in spite of my ugly form, and would cry tears on my behalf. You with your heart of an angel have done just that, and I cannot thank you enough. If you will become my wife, I will repay with love what you have done for me."" Nettchen extended him her hand, and they were married. Then the deathly quiet castle awoke in a hustle and bustle. Joy ruled everywhere, and the newlyweds lived in bliss. Now the young wife had been given the requirement that she not return to her father's house for one year. However, she obtained a mirror in which she could see everything that was happening in her family circle. Nettchen looked into the mirror often, and she saw her father in his sorrow, although her sisters were cheerful and gay. She observed Little Broomstick as well, and how she mourned for her lost girlfriend. She did not look into the mirror for some time, and when she returned to it, she saw her father on his deathbed and her sisters in the next room making merry with their friends. This saddened the good sister, and she confided her sorrow with her husband. He comforted her, saying, ""Your father will not die. In my garden there is a plant whose sap can call back the fleeing life-spirits. The year is nearly over. Then we will fetch your father, and you will not have to be separated from him any longer."" Nettchen was pleased with this, and as soon as the year had passed, the husband and wife and their magnificent entourage journeyed to Nettchen's home city. The two older sisters nearly burst with envy and anger, while the father's joy brought back his health, so that evil turned to good. The sap restored his full strength and wellbeing. Little Broomstick too was overjoyed, and Nettchen was her old girlfriend once again. She and the merchant accompanied them back to the prince's castle. Nettchen had a forgiving heart, and however much she had been hurt by her sisters, she wanted to share her good fortune with them. Therefore she invited them to visit her, and showed them all her wealth. However, the splendor angered the sisters, and they resolved to kill their happy sister. Once when they were in the bath, they forced Nettchen under the water, and she drowned. They had scarcely done this when a tall female figure rose up before them and glared at them with angry eyes. She touched the dead woman with a wand, and she came back to life. ""I am the sorceress who once transformed the prince,"" said the tall figure. I have noted your good heart and taken you under my protection. These miserable ones killed you. Now I leave their fate in your hands!"" Nettchen begged for mercy for them, but the sorceress shook her head and said, ""They must die, for you will never be safe from their malice, and as soon as they have been punished, my power will cease."" ""Then do with them what you will!"" sobbed Nettchen. ""Let them be transformed into columns and remain such until a man falls in love with them, and that will never happen."" She touched the sisters with her hand, and they were immediately transformed into two stone columns, which to this day are still standing in the garden of the splendid castle, for it has not yet occurred to any man that he should fall in love with cold, heartless stones. The good Little Broomstick remained Nettchen's most faithful girlfriend. She still shares her good fortune with her, if in the meantime the two of them have not died.",Germany,"Source: Ludwig Bechstein, ""Besenstielchen,"" Deutsches Märchenbuch, 5th edition (Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand, 1847), pp. 228-32.","Ludwig Bechstein (1801-1860) was Germany's most widely read collector and editor of folktales during the nineteenth century, his popularity within Germany at that time surpassing that of his more scholarly contemporaries, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.",Translated by D.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,Rose,"Once it was necessary for him to go on a long journey. He asked each of his daughters what he should bring them for a present. The elder daughters wanted silk dresses, jewelry, and all that was rare. Little Rose stood by, not saying a word. Her father asked: ""Little Rose, what can I bring for you?"" ""Nothing, father, but a rose."" And she kissed her father, and bade him good-by. ""Rose, I shall bring you a rose, the very prettiest I can get, if it should cost me my life."" After he got to his journey's end, he came to a splendid palace. The house was empty, but all in order. His breakfast was ready, but he could see no one. He stayed all night, in the morning went into the garden, and oh, the beautiful rose! After he plucked the rose, and had gone a few steps, a great lion met him, frothing at the mouth, and told him, ""For this rose you shall die."" The father said that he had a very beautiful daughter at home, whose name was Rose, and that, as he was leaving, he promised to bring her a rose; and he pleaded, ""If you will only let me go home to my little daughter to bid her farewell."" So the lion let him go home, on condition that he was to return. And as he came home Rose was looking out of the window and saw her father coming, and ran to meet him. ""Why,"" said she, ""father, what makes you look so sad?"" ""Nothing, my child, except that I have plucked a rose, and for this rose I must die."" ""No, father, you shall not go back and die for the rose, but I will go back and ask to have you pardoned."" So she went to the palace. As she entered it seemed to her that everything which her eyes fell on seemed to say, ""Welcome, Beauty, here!"" Even on her cup and saucer, and on every piece of furniture in her chamber were the words, ""Welcome, Beauty, here!"" She went out to find the lion, and said that she had come to ask him to forgive her father, and that the rose was for her. But the lion said he would not do it unless she would promise to be his wife. Her father was very dear to her, yet she did not like to marry a lion. The lion gave her a beautiful gold ring, and told her that whenever she wanted to see her father she was to lay the ring on her table before going to sleep, and wish to see her father, and she would be at home in the morning. Her father was now getting old, and she grieved for him. At night she laid her ring on the table, at the same time making a wish that she would like to see her father. The next morning she found herself with her father, whom she found much changed. His hair had turned white from grief at the thought of losing his Rose, or having her marry the lion. That night she laid her ring on the table, and wished herself back at the palace. The palace was more beautiful than before, and the table all ready. On every plate were the words, ""Welcome, Beauty, here!"" On the first morning she went out into the garden. The poor lion was lying very sick, and she looked at him. ""Oh, I cannot bear to see my poor lion die; what am I to do?"" Finally, she said that she could not bear it any longer, and she called out, ""I will be your wife."" With this a beautiful young prince stood before her. So they were married, and he sent for her father, and the stepsisters who had been so cruel to her were made servants to stand at the post of the gate before the palace, and all the people were happy.",Irish-American,"Source: W.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Bear Prince,"A merchant once wanted to go to market. He asked his three daughters what he should bring home for them. The oldest one said, ""I would like pearls and precious stones."" ""You can buy a sky-blue dress for me,"" said the middle one. But the youngest one said, ""Nothing in the world would be dearer to me than a grape."" Once at the market, the merchant saw as many pearls and precious stones as he could possibly want. And he soon purchased a sky-blue dress as well. But as for a grape, he could not find one anywhere at the market. This saddened him greatly, because he loved his youngest daughter most of all. Buried thus in his thoughts, he was making his way toward home when a little dwarf stepped before him. He asked, ""Why are you so sad?"" ""Oh,"" answered the merchant, ""I was supposed to bring home a grape for my youngest daughter, but I was not able to find one anywhere at the market."" The dwarf said, ""Just take a few steps into that meadow down there, and you will come to a large vineyard. A white bear will be there. He will growl fiercely when you approach, but don't let that frighten you. You'll get a grape after all."" So the merchant went down into the meadow, and it happened just as the dwarf had said. A white bear was keeping guard at the vineyard, and he growled at the merchant when he was still a long way off. ""What do you want here?"" ""Be so good,"" said the merchant, ""and let me take a grape for my youngest daughter, just a single one."" ""You cannot have one,"" said the bear, ""unless you promise to give me that which will first greet you upon your arrival home."" The merchant did not think long about this before accepting the bear's terms. Then he was permitted to take a grape, and he happily made his way toward home. Upon his arrival home, the youngest daughter ran out to meet him, for she -- more than anyone else -- had missed him, and she could hardly wait to see him. Seeing the grape in his hand, she threw her arms around his neck and could scarcely contain herself for joy. But the father was overcome with sorrow, and he could not tell anyone why. Every day he expected the white bear to come and demand from him his dearest child. When exactly one year had passed since he taken the grape from the vineyard, the bear did indeed trot up, confronted the merchant, and said, ""Now give me that which first greeted you upon your arrival home, or I'll eat you."" The merchant had not lost all of his senses, and he said, ""Take my dog. He jumped right out the door when he saw me coming."" But the bear began to growl loudly and said, ""He is not the right one. If you don't keep your promise, I'll eat you."" Then the merchant said, ""So just take the apple tree in front of the house. That was the first thing that I met."" But the bear growled even stronger and said, ""That is not the right one. If you don't keep your promise immediately, I'll eat you."" Nothing more would help. The merchant had to surrender his youngest daughter. When she came out, a coach drove up. The bear led her inside, sat down next to her, and away they went. After a while the coach stopped in the courtyard of a castle, and the bear led the daughter into the castle and welcomed her. This was his home, he said, and from now on she would be his wife. He gave her everything that her heart could desire, so that with time it no longer occurred to her that her husband was a bear. There were just two things that seemed strange to her: Why did the bear insist on having no lights at nighttime, and why did he always feel so cold? After she had been with him for some time he asked her, ""Do you know how long you have been here?"" ""No,"" she said, ""I haven't been thinking about time at all."" ""All the better,"" said the bear. ""It's been exactly one year. Get ready for a journey, for we must visit your father once again."" She did so with great joy, and after arriving at her father's she told him all about her life in the castle. Afterward, when she was taking leave from him, he secretly gave her some matches that the bear was not supposed to see. But the bear did see them, and he growled angrily, ""Stop that, or I'll eat you."" Then he took his wife back to the castle, and they lived there together as before. Some time later the bear said, ""Do you know how long you have been here?"" ""No,"" she said, ""I don't notice the time."" ""All the better,"" said the bear. ""You have been here exactly two years. Get ready for a journey. It is time for us to visit your father once again."" She did it once again, and everything happened as the first time. But when she visited her father the third time, the bear failed to see that her father secretly gave her some matches. After arriving back at the castle, she could hardly wait for night to come when the bear was sleeping next to her in bed. Silently she struck a light and was startled with amazement and joy, for next to her was lying a handsome youth with a golden crown on his head. He smiled at her and said, ""Many thanks for redeeming me. You were the wife of an enchanted prince. Now we can celebrate our wedding properly, for now I am the king of this land."" With that the entire castle came alive. Servants and attendants came from all sides, wishing good luck to the king and the queen.",Switzerland,"Source: Otto Sutermeister, ""Der Bärenprinz,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen aus der Schweiz (Aarau: H.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Clinking Clanking Lowesleaf,"Once upon a time there was a king who had three daughters. The youngest was his pride and joy. One day he wanted to go to the fair to buy something, and he asked his three daughters what he should bring home for them. The first one asked for a golden spinning wheel. The second one a golden yarn reel, and the third one a clinking clanking lowesleaf. The king promised to bring these things and rode away. At the fair he bought the golden spinning wheel and the golden yarn reel, but no one had a clinking clanking lowesleaf for sale. He looked everywhere, but could not find one. This saddened him, because the youngest daughter was the joy of his life, and he wanted to please her ever so much. As he sorrowfully made his way homeward, he came to a great, great forest and to a large birch tree. Under the birch tree there lay a large black poodle dog. Because the king looked so sad, the dog asked him what was the matter. ""Oh,"" answered the king, ""I was supposed to bring a clinking clanking lowesleaf to my youngest daughter, whom I love above anything else, but I cannot find one anywhere, and that is why I am so sad."" ""I can help you,"" said the poodle. ""The clinking clanking lowesleaf grows in this tree. If a year and a day from now you will give me that which first greets you upon your arrival home today, then you can have it."" At first the king did not want to agree, but he thought about it long and hard, then said to himself, ""What could it be but our dog? Go ahead and make the promise."" And he made the promise. The poodle wagged his tail, climbed up into the birch, broke off the leaf with his frizzy-haired paw, and gave it to the king, saying, ""You had better keep your word, or you will wish that you had!"" The king repeated his promise, took the leaf, and rode on joyfully. As he approached home, his youngest daughter jumped out with joy to greet him. The king was horrified. His heart was so filled with grief that he pushed her aside. She started to cry, thinking, ""What does this mean, that father is pushing me away?"" and she went inside and complained to her mother. Soon the king came in. He gave the oldest girl the golden spinning wheel, the middle one the golden yarn reel, and the youngest one the clinking clanking lowesleaf, and he was quiet and sad. Then the queen asked him was wrong with him, and why he had pushed the youngest daughter away; but he said nothing. He grieved the entire year. He lamented and mourned and became thin and pale, so concerned was he. Whenever the queen asked him what was wrong, he only shook his head or walked away. Finally, when the year was nearly at its end, he could not longer keep still, and he told her about his misfortune, and thought that his wife would die of shock. She too was horrified, but she soon took hold of herself and said, ""You men don't think of anything! After all, don't we have the goose herder's daughter? Let's dress her up and give her to the poodle. A stupid poodle will never know the difference."" The day arrived, and they dressed up the goose girl in their youngest daughter's clothes until she looked just perfect. They had scarcely finished when they heard a bark outside, and a scratching sound at the gate. They looked out, and sure enough, it was the large black poodle dog. They wondered who had taught him to count. After all, a year has more than three hundred days, and even a human can lose count, to say nothing of a dog! But he had not lost count. He had come to take away the princess. The king and queen greeted him in a friendly manner, then led him outside to the goose girl. He wagged his tail and pawed at her, then he lay down on his belly and said, She sat down on him, and he took off across the heath. Soon they came to a great, great forest. When they came to the large birch tree, the poodle stopped to rest a while, for it was a hot day, and it was cool and shady here. Around and about there were many daisies [called Gänseblümchen -- goose flowers -- in German] poking up their white heads from the beautiful grass, and the girl thought about her parents, and sighed, ""Oh, if only my father were here. He could graze the geese so nicely here in this beautiful, lush meadow."" The poodle stood up, shook himself, and said, ""Just what kind of a girl are you?"" ""I am a goose girl, and my father tends geese,"" she answered. She would have liked to say what the queen had told her to say, but it was impossible for anyone to tell a lie under this tree. She could not, and she could not. He jumped up abruptly, looked at her threateningly, and said, ""You are not the right one. I have no use for you:"" They were not far from the king's house, when the queen saw them and realized which way the wind was blowing. Therefore she took the broom binder's daughter, dressed her up in even more beautiful clothes. When the poodle arrived and made nasty threats, she brought the broom girl out to him, saying, ""This is the right girl!"" ""We shall see,"" responded the poodle dog. The queen became very uneasy, and the king's throat tightened, but the poodle wagged his tail and scratched, then lay down on his belly, saying, The broom girl sat down on him, and he took off across the heath. Soon they too came to the great forest and to the large birch tree. As they sat there resting, the girl thought about her parents, and sighed, ""Oh, if only my father were here. He could make brooms so easily, for here there are masses of thin twigs!"" The poodle stood up, shook himself, and said, ""Just what kind of a girl are you?"" She wanted to lie, for the queen had ordered her to, and she was a very strict mistress, but she could not, because she was under this tree, and she answered, ""I am a broom girl, and my father makes brooms."" He jumped up as though he were mad, looked at her threateningly, and said, ""You are not the right one. I have no use for you:"" They approached the king's house, and the king and queen, who had been steadily looking out the window, began to moan and cry, especially the king, for the youngest daughter was the apple of his eye. The court officials cried and sobbed as well, and there was nothing but mourning everywhere. But it was to no avail. The poodle arrived and said, ""This time give me the right girl, or you will wish that you had!"" He spoke with such a frightful voice and made such angry gestures, that everyone's heart stood still, and their skin shuddered. Then they led out the youngest daughter, dressed in white, and as pale as snow. It was as though the moon had just come out from behind dark clouds. The poodle knew that she was the right one, and said with a caressing voice, He ran much more gently this time, and did not stop in the great forest under the birch tree, but hurried deeper and deeper into the woods until they finally reached a small house, where he quietly lay the princess, who had fallen asleep, onto a soft bed. She slumbered on and dreamed about her parents, and about the strange ride, and she laughed and cried in her sleep. The poodle lay down in his hut and kept watch over the little house and the princess. When she awoke the next morning and found herself soul alone, she cried and grieved and wanted to run away, but she could not, because the house was enchanted. It let people enter, but no one could leave. There was plenty there to eat and drink, everything that even a princess could desire, but she did not want anything and did not take a single bite. She could neither see nor hear the poodle, but the birds sang wonderfully. There were deer grazing around and about, and they looked at the princess with their large eyes. The morning wind curled her golden locks and poured fresh color over her face. The princess sighed and said, ""Oh, if only someone were here, even if it were the most miserable, dirty beggar woman. I would kiss her and hug her and love her and honor her!"" ""Is that true?"" screeched a harsh voice close behind her, startling the princess. She looked around, and there stood a bleary-eyed woman as old as the hills. She glared at the princess and said, ""You called for a beggar woman, and a beggar woman is here! In the future do not despise beggar women. Now listen well! The poodle dog is an enchanted prince, this hut an enchanted castle, the forest an enchanted city, and all the animals enchanted people. If you are a genuine princess and are also kind to poor people, then you can redeem them all and become rich and happy. The poodle goes away every morning, because he has to, and every evening he returns home, because he wants to. At midnight he pulls off his rough hide and becomes an ordinary man. If he knocks on your bedroom door, do not let him in, however much he asks and begs, not the first night, not the second night, and especially not the third night. During the third night, after he has tired himself out talking and has fallen asleep, take the hide, make a large fire, and burn it. But first lock your bedroom door securely, so that he cannot get in, and do not open it when he scratches on the door, if you cherish your life. And on your wedding day say three times, don't forget it now, say three times: and I will see you again."" The princess took very careful notice of everything, and the old woman disappeared. The first night the prince asked and begged her to open her door, but she answered, ""No, I'll not do it,"" and she did not do it. The second night he asked her even more sweetly, but she did not answer at all. She buried her head in her pillow, and she did not open the door. The third night he asked her so touchingly and sang such beautiful melodies to her, that she wanted to jump up and open the door for him, but fortunately she remembered the old woman and her mother and father. She pulled the bedcovers over her head, and did not open the door. Complaining, the prince walked away, but she did not hear him leave. While he slept she built up the fire, crept out on tiptoe, picked up the rough hide from the corner where the poodle always put it, barred the bedroom door, and threw it into the flames. The poodle jumped up howling, gnawed and clawed at the door, threatened, begged, growled, and howled again. But she did not open the door, and he could not open the door, however fiercely he threw himself against it. The fire flamed up brightly one last time, and there was an enormous bang, as if heaven and hell had exploded. Standing before her was the most handsome prince in the world. The hut was now a magnificent castle, the forest a great city full of palaces, and the animals were all kinds of people. At their wedding ceremony, the prince and the princess were seated at the table with the old king and the old queen and the two sisters and many rich and important people, when the bride called out three times, and the tattered old woman came in. The old queen scolded, and the two princesses scolded, and they wanted to chase her away, but the young queen stood up and let the old woman sit down at her place, eat from her plate, and drink from her goblet. When the old woman had eaten and drunk her fill, she looked at the old queen and the evil daughters, and they became crooked and lame. But she blessed the young queen, and she became seven times more beautiful, and no one ever saw or heard from the old woman again.",Germany,"Source: Carl and Theodor Colshorn, ""Vom klinkesklanken Lowesblatt,"" Märchen und Sagen aus Hannover (Hannover: Verlag von Carl Ruempler, 1854), no. 20, pp. 64-69.",NA,Translated by D.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Enchanted Tsarévich,"The eldest asked for a new coat, and the next one also asked for a new coat; but the youngest one only took a sheet of paper and sketched a flower on it. ""Bring me, bátyushka [father], a flower like this!"" So the merchant went and made a long journey to foreign kingdoms, but he could never see such a flower. So he came back home, and he saw on his way a splendid lofty palace with watchtowers, turrets, and a garden. He went a walk in the garden, and you cannot imagine how many trees he saw and flowers, every flower fairer than the other flowers. And then he looked and he saw a single one like the one which his daughter had sketched. ""Oh,"" he said, ""I will tear off and bring this to my beloved daughter; evidently there is nobody here to watch me."" So he ran up and broke it off, and as soon as he had done it, in that very instant a boisterous wind arose and thunder thundered, and a fearful monster stood in front of him, a formless, winged snake with three heads. ""How dared you play the master in my garden!"" cried the snake to the merchant. ""Why have you broken off a blossom?"" The merchant was frightened, fell on his knees and besought pardon. ""Very well,"" said the snake, ""I will forgive you, but on condition that whoever meets you first, when you reach home, you must give me for all eternity; and, if you deceive me, do not forget, nobody can ever hide himself from me. I shall find you wherever you are."" The merchant agreed to the condition and came back home. And the youngest daughter saw him from the window and ran out to meet him. Then the merchant hung his head, looked at his beloved daughter, and began to shed bitter tears. ""What is the matter with you? Why are you weeping, bátyushka?"" He gave her the blossom and told what had befallen him. ""Do not grieve, bátyushka ,"" said the youngest daughter. ""It is God's gift. Perhaps I shall fare well. Take me to the snake."" So the father took her away, set her in the palace, bade farewell, and set out home. Then the fair maiden, the daughter of the merchant, went in the different rooms, and beheld everywhere gold and velvet; but no one was there to be seen, not a single human soul. Time went by and went by, and the fair damsel became hungry and thought, ""Oh, if I could only have something to eat!"" But before ever she had thought, in front of her stood a table, and on the table were dishes and drinks and refreshments. The only thing that was not there was birds' milk. Then she sat down to the table, drank and ate, got up, and it had all vanished. Darkness now came on, and the merchant's daughter went into the bedroom, wishing to lie down and sleep. Then a boisterous wind rustled round and the three- headed snake appeared in front of her. ""Hail, fair maiden! Put my bed outside this door!"" So the fair maiden put the bed outside the door and herself lay on the bedstead. She awoke in the morning, and again in the entire house there was not a single soul to be seen. And it all went well with her. Whatever she wished for appeared on the spot. In the evening the snake flew to her and ordered, ""Now, fair maiden, put my bed next to your bedstead."" She then laid it next to her bedstead, and the night went by, and the maiden awoke, and again there was never a soul in the palace. And for the third time the snake came in the evening and said, ""Now, fair maiden, I am going to lie with you in the bedstead."" The merchant's daughter was fearfully afraid of lying on a single bed with such a formless monster. But she could not help herself, so she strengthened her heart and lay down with him. In the morning the serpent said to her, ""If you are now weary, fair maiden, go to your father and your sisters. Spend a day with them, and in the evening come back to me. But see to it that you are not late. If you are one single minute late I shall die of grief."" ""No, I shall not be late,"" said the maiden, the merchant's daughter, and descended the steps; there was a barouche ready for her, and she sat down. That very instant she arrived at her father's courtyard. Then the father saw, welcomed, kissed her, and asked her, ""How has God been dealing with you, my beloved daughter ? Has it been well with you?"" ""Very well, father!"" And she started telling of all the wealth there was in the palace, how the snake loved her, how whatever she only thought of was in that instant fulfilled. The sisters heard, and did not know what to do out of sheer envy. Now the day was ebbing away, and the fair maiden made ready to go back, and was bidding farewell to her father and her sisters, saying, ""This is the time I must go back. I was bidden keep to my term."" But the envious sisters rubbed onions on their eyes and made as though they were weeping: ""Do not go away, sister; stay until tomorrow."" She was very sorry for her sisters, and stayed one day more. In the morning she bade farewell to them all and went to the palace. When she arrived it was as empty as before. She went into the garden, and she saw the serpent lying dead in the pond! He had thrown himself for sheer grief into the water. ""Oh, my God, what have I done!"" cried out the fair maiden, and she wept bitter tears, ran. up to the pond, hauled the snake out of the water, embraced one head and kissed it with all her might. And the snake trembled, and in a minute turned into a good youth. ""I thank you, fair maiden,"" he said. ""You have saved me from the greatest misfortune. I am no snake, but an enchanted prince."" Then they went back to the merchant's house, were betrothed, lived long, and lived for good and happy things.",Russia,"Source: Leonard A. Magnus, Russian Folk-Tales (New York: E. P.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Fairy Serpent,"One day when he found no flowers along his route homeward he went into the woods to look for wild blossoms, and he unwittingly invaded the domain of a fairy serpent, that coiled around him, held him tightly, and railed at him for having entered his garden. The man excused himself, saying that he came merely to get a few flowers for his daughters, who would be sorely disappointed were he to go home without his usual gift to them. The snake asked him the number, the names, and the ages of his daughters, and then refused to let him go unless he promised one of them in marriage to him. The poor man tried every argument he could think of to induce the snake to release him upon easier terms, but the reptile would accept no other ransom. At last the father, dreading greater evil to his daughters should they be deprived of his protection, gave the required promise and went home. He could eat no supper, however, for he knew the power of fairies to afflict those who offend them, and he was full of anxiety concerning the misfortunes that must overwhelm his whole family should the compact be disregarded. Some days passed; his daughters carefully prepared his meals, and affectionately besought him to eat them, but he would not come to the table. He was always plunged in sorrowful meditation. They conferred among themselves as to the cause of his uncommon behavior, and, having decided that one of them must have displeased him, they agreed to try to find out which one it might be, by going separately, each in turn, to urge him to eat. The eldest went, expressed her distress at his loss of appetite, and urged him to partake of food. He replied that he would do so if she would for his sake marry the snake to whom he had promised a wife. She bluntly refused to carry out her father's contract, and left him in deeper trouble than before. The second daughter then went to beg him to take food, received the same reply, and likewise declined meeting the engagement he had made. The youngest daughter then went and entreated him to eat, heard his story, and at once declared that, if he would care for his own health properly, she would become the bride of the serpent. The father therefore took his meals again, the days sped without bringing calamity, and the welfare of the family for a time seemed secure. But one morning, as the girls were sitting at their embroidery, a wasp flew into the room and sang: Then the youngest said that, in order to relieve the family of the buzzing plague, she would go to her uncanny bridegroom. The wasps accompanied her on the road, and guided her into the woods where the fairy serpent awaited her in a palace that he had built for her reception. There were spacious rooms with carved furniture inlaid with precious stones, chests full of silken fabrics, caskets of jade, and jewels of gold. The snake had beautiful eyes and a musical voice; but his skin was warty, and the girl shuddered at the thought of daily seeing him about. After the wedding supper, at which the two sat alone, the girl told her spouse that she appreciated the excellence of all that he had provided for her, and that she should perform all her domestic duties exactly. For many days she kept the house neat, cooked the food, and made all things pleasant for her repulsive bridegroom. He doted upon her, and pined whenever she was out of his sight. So heedful was he of her wishes and her welfare, that she grew to like his companionship, and to feel a great lonesomeness whenever he was absent. Having no help in her household work, she was, one day, on finding the well dried up, obliged to go into the forest in search of water, which she finally discovered and toilsomely brought back from a distant spring. On returning she found the snake dying of thirst, and in her eagerness to save his life she grasped and plunged him into the water, from which he rose transformed, a strong and handsome man. He had been the subject of wicked enchantment, from which her dutiful quest and gracious pity set him free. Thereafter she often with her admirable husband visited her old home and carried gifts to those who were less happy than she.",China Additional tales about animal brides and bridegrooms,"Source: Adele M.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Little Nut Twig,"Once upon a time there was a rich merchant whose business required him to travel abroad. Taking leave, he said to his three daughters, ""Dear daughters, I would like to have something nice for you when I return. What should I bring home for you?"" The oldest one said, ""Father dear, a beautiful pearl necklace for me!"" The second one said, ""I would like a finger ring with a diamond stone."" The youngest one cuddled up to her father and whispered, ""Daddy, a pretty green nut twig for me."" ""Good, my dear daughters,"" said the merchant, ""I will remember. Farewell."" The merchant traveled far and purchased many goods, but he also faithfully remembered his daughters' wishes. To please his eldest he had packed a costly pearl necklace into his baggage, and he had also purchased an equally valuable diamond ring for the middle daughter. But, however much he tried, he could not find a green nut twig. For this reason he went on foot a good distance on his homeward journey. His way led him in large part through the woods, and he hoped thus finally to find a nut twig. However, he did not succeed, and the good father became very depressed that he had not been able to fulfill the harmless request of his youngest and dearest child. Finally, as he was sadly making his way down a path that led through a dark forest and next to a dense thicket, his hat rubbed against a twig, and it made a sound like hailstones falling on it. Looking up he saw that it was a pretty green nut twig, from which was hanging a cluster of golden nuts. The man was delighted. He reached his hand up and plucked the magnificent twig. But in that same instant, a wild bear shot out from the thicket and stood up on his back paws, growling fiercely, as though he were about to tear the merchant to pieces. With a terrible voice he bellowed, ""Why did you pick my nut twig, you? Why? I will eat you up!"" Shaking and trembling with fear the merchant said, ""Dear bear, don't eat me. Let me go on my way with the little nut twig. I'll give you a large ham and many sausages for it!"" But the bear bellowed again, ""Keep your ham and your sausages! I will not eat you, only if you will promise to give me the first thing that meets you upon your arrival home."" The merchant gladly agreed to this, for he recalled how his poodle usually ran out to greet him, and he would gladly sacrifice the poodle in order to save his own life. Following a crude handshake the bear lumbered back into the thicket. The merchant, breathing a sigh of relief, went hurriedly and happily on his way. The golden nut twig decorated the merchant's had splendidly as he hurried homeward. Filled with joy, the youngest girl ran to greet her dear father. The poodle followed her with bold leaps. The oldest daughters and the mother were not quite so fast to step out the door and greet home-comer. The merchant was horrified to see that the first one to greet him was his youngest daughter. Concerned and saddened, he withdrew from the happy child's embrace, and -- following the initial greetings -- told them all that had happened with the nut twig. They all cried and were very sad, but the youngest daughter showed the most courage, and she resolved to fulfill her father's promise. The mother soon thought up a good plan. She said, ""Dear ones, let's not be afraid. If the bear should come to hold you to your promise, dear husband, instead of giving him our youngest daughter, let's give him the herdsman's daughter. He will be satisfied with her."" This proposal was accepted. The daughters were happy once again, and they were very pleased with their beautiful presents. The youngest one always kept her nut twig with her, and she soon forgot the bear and her father's promise. But one day a dark carriage rattled through the street and up to the front of the merchant's house. The ugly bear climbed out and walked into the house growling. He went up to the startled man and asked that his promise be fulfilled. Quickly and secretly they fetched the herdsman's daughter, who was very ugly, dressed her in good clothes, and put her in the bear's carriage. The journey began. Once outside the town, the bear laid his wild shaggy head in the shepherd girl's lap and growled, The girl began to do so, but she did not do it the way the bear wanted her to, and he realized that he had been deceived. He was about to eat the disguised shepherd girl, but in her fright she quickly fled from the carriage. Then the bear rode back to the merchant's house and, with terrible threats, demanded the right bride. So the dear maiden had to come forward, and -- following a bitterly sorrowful farewell -- she rode away with the ugly bridegroom. Once outside the town, he laid his coarse head in the girl's lap and growled again, And the girl did just that, and she did it so softly that it pacified him, and his terrible bearish expression became friendly. Gradually the bear's poor bride began to gain some trust toward him. The journey did not last long, for the carriage traveled extremely fast, like a windstorm through the air. They soon came to a very dark forest, and the carriage suddenly stopped in front of a dark and yawning cave. This was where the bear lived. Oh, how the girl trembled! The bear embraced her with his claw-arms and said to her with a friendly growl, ""This is where you will live, my little bride; and you will be happy, as long as you behave yourself here, otherwise my wild animals will tear you apart."" As soon as they had gone a few steps inside the dark cave, he unlocked an iron door and stepped with his bride into a room that was filled with poisonous worms. They hissed at them rapaciously. The bear growled into his little bride's ear, Then the girl did indeed walk through the room without looking around, and all the while not a single worm stirred or moved. And in this manner they went through ten more rooms, and the last one was filled with the most terrible creatures: dragons and snakes, toads swollen with poison, basilisks and lindorms. And in each room the bear growled, The girl trembled and quaked with fear, like the leaves of an aspen, but she remained steadfast and did not look around, neither right nor left. When the door to the twelfth room opened up, a glistening stream of light shone toward the two of them. The most beautiful music sounded from within, and everywhere there were cries of joy. Before the bride could comprehend this -- she was still trembling from seeing such horrible things, and now this surprising loveliness -- there was a terrible clap of thunder, and she thought that earth and heaven were breaking apart. It was soon quiet once again. The forest, the cave, the poisonous animals, and the bear had all disappeared. In their place stood a splendid castle with rooms decorated in gold and with beautifully dressed servants. And the bear had been transformed into a handsome young man. He was the prince of this magnificent castle, and he pressed his little bride to his heart, thanking her a thousand times that she had redeemed him and his servants -- the wild animals -- from their enchantment. She was now a high and wealthy princess, but she always wore the beautiful nut twig on her breast. It never wilted, and she especially liked to wear it, because it had been the key to her good fortune. Her parents and sisters were soon informed of this happy turn of events. The bear prince had them brought to the castle, where they lived in splendid happiness forever after.",Germany,"Source: Ludwig Bechstein, ""Das Nusszweiglein,"" Deutsches Märchenbuch, 5th edition (Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand, 1847), pp. 81-85.","Ludwig Bechstein (1801-1860) was Germany's most widely read collector and editor of folktales during the nineteenth century, his popularity within Germany at that time surpassing that of his more scholarly contemporaries, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.",Translated by D.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Singing Rose,"A king had three daughters. They were more beautiful than the young women of today, and each had passed her sixteenth year of life. The king thought about making one of his daughters queen, but he did not know which one he should select over the other two. One day he summoned all three and said to them, ""My dear children, I am now old and frail, and every day is a gift. Before I die, I would like to bring everything in my realm into order and name one of you as the heir to my kingdom. Now go out into the wide world, and the one of you who brings back a singing rose shall inherit my throne, and she shall be queen over the entire land."" When the three daughters had heard this, they tearfully took leave of their old father, then -- trusting their luck -- set forth for foreign lands, each taking a different path. It happened that the youngest and most beautiful of them had to go through a dark pine forest. All kinds of birds were singing at the same time. It was wonderful to listen to them. It began to get dark, the birds flew to their nests, and after a while it became quiet as a mouse. Then suddenly a bright, beautiful, loud tone sounded forth, such as the princess had never heard before, neither from birds nor from humans, and she immediately thought, ""That can only be the singing rose."" She hurried on in the direction that the marvelous sounds seemed to be coming from. She had not walked long before she saw a large, old-fashioned castle on a cliff. She eagerly climbed up to the castle and pulled several times on the latch. Finally the gate opened with a creaking sound, and an old man with a long, ice-gray beard looked out. ""What is your wish?"" he grumpily asked the startled maiden. ""I would like a singing rose,"" she answered. ""Do you have such a thing in your garden?"" ""Yes indeed,"" answered the old man. ""What will you take for it, if I could get it from you?"" ""You need give me nothing for the singing rose. You can have it today, but as payment, I will come to you in seven years and bring you back with me to this, my castle."" ""Just bring me quickly the valuable flower,"" shouted the maiden joyfully, for she was thinking only about the singing rose and the kingdom, but not about what would happen after seven years. The old man went back into the castle, and returned soon with a full, glowing rose. It was singing so beautifully that the maiden's heart jumped for joy. She eagerly reached out her hand for it, and as soon as she had the flower in her hands she ran down the mountain like a deer. The old man called after her with a serious voice, ""I will see you in seven years!"" The maiden wandered the entire night through the dark woods with her rose. Her pleasure in the singing flower and the inherited kingdom caused her to forget all fear. The rose sang without pause the entire way; and the louder and more beautifully it sang, the faster the princess hurried on toward her homeland. She arrived home and told her father everything that had happened to her, and the rose sang beautifully. Immeasurable joy ruled in the castle, and the king gave one celebration after the other. Soon the two older sisters returned. They had found nothing, and had had to return home empty handed. And now the youngest daughter, who had brought back the rose, became queen, although the old father continued to rule. The royal family lived beautiful, joyful days. Day after day and year after year slipped by. Finally the seventh year came to an end, and on the first day of the eighth year the old man from the castle appeared before the king and demanded from him the one of his daughter who had brought home the singing rose. The king presented to him his oldest daughter, but the old man rejected her, shaking his head and growling, ""She is not the right one."" When the king saw that he could not get away with deception, he -- with a bleeding heart -- turned over the youngest and dearest of his children. The princess now had to go with the grumbling graybeard to his castle, from which she had once obtained the singing rose. The beautiful maiden was very sad, for she had no one there except for her old master. Day after day she sorrowfully thought about her father and her sisters. In the castle there were other pleasures in abundance, but they did not comfort her, for she did not have the company of her loved ones. Her thoughts were always in her homeland. Further, all the doors and chests in the castle were locked, and the old man did not let her have access to a single key. One day she learned -- God knows from where! -- that her oldest sister was to marry a neighboring prince, and that the wedding would take place in a few days. Disquieted, she went to the old man and asked him for permission to attend her sister's wedding. ""Just go!"" growled the old man. ""But I am telling you in advance, do not laugh once during the entire wedding day. If you disobey my order, I will tear you into a thousand pieces. I myself will continually be by your side, and if you as much as open your mouth to laugh, it will be over with you. Take notice!"" The princess thought that this would be easy to follow, and on the announced day she appeared with the old graybeard at her sister's wedding. Joy ruled in the king's castle when they saw the long missing queen returning. She was very happy and took advantage of the day, but she did not forget the old man's order, and she did not once open her mouth to laugh. That evening she had to take leave from her loved ones, and she sadly returned to the lonely castle with her companion. Her time of monotony began once again, and the poor princess was always glad when a day finally ended. Then the rumor came to her ears that the other sister would marry soon. This disquieted her again, and she asked the old man if she could not attend her second sister's wedding. ""Just go!"" growled the old man."" But this time you are not allowed to speak a single word the entire day. I will go with you again and observe you vigilantly. The princess thought that this would be easy to follow, and on the announced day she appeared with the old graybeard at her sister's wedding. Joy ruled in the king's castle when they saw the long missing queen returning. Everyone ran out to meet her. They greeted her and welcomed her and asked her about everything. But she pretended that she could not talk, and did not allow a single sound to escape from her beautiful lips. But this time she did not keep up her courage as well as she had the last time, and that evening when everyone was talking together until it was humming like a beehive, a little word slipped out. The old man quickly jumped up, took her by the hand, and led her out of the hall and back to his lonely castle. Here the princess had other things in great abundance, but she greatly missed the company of her loved ones, and everything seemed terribly monotonous to her. One day when she was sadly walking through the garden where the rose had previously blossomed and sung, the old man came to her and said with a serious expression, ""Your majesty, if tomorrow while it is striking twelve you will cut off my head in three blows, then everything that you find in the castle will be yours, and you will be free forever!"" The princess took heart from the old man's speech and decided to attempt the risky deed. The next day -- it was Saturday -- the old man appeared a little before twelve o'clock and uncovered his neck. She drew the sword that she had hung about her waist, and as the castle clock struck one she swung the sword once, then quickly again two more times. The old man's head rolled away on the floor. But behold! Instead of blood, a key fell from the head. It opened all the chests and doors in the entire castle. There the princess found many, many precious things, and she was rich and free forever.",Austria,"Source: Source: Ignaz and Joseph Zingerle, ""Die singende Rose,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Innsbruck: Verlag der Wagner'schen Buchhandlung, 1852), no. 30, pp. 183-88.",NA,Translated by D.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Small-Tooth Dog,"Once upon a time there was a merchant who traveled about the world a great deal. On one of his journeys thieves attacked him, and they would have taken both his life and his money if a large dog had not come to his rescue and driven the thieves away. When the dog had driven the thieves away he took the merchant to his house, which was a very handsome one, and dressed his wounds and nursed him till he was well. As soon as he was able to travel the merchant began his journey home, but before starting he told the dog how grateful he was for his kindness, and asked him what reward he could offer in return, and he said he would not refuse to give the most precious thing he had. And so the merchant said to the dog, ""Will you accept a fish I have that can speak twelve languages?"" ""No,"" said the dog, ""I will not."" ""Or a goose that lays golden eggs?"" ""No,"" said the dog, ""I will not."" ""Or a mirror in which you can see what anybody is thinking about?"" ""No,"" said the dog, ""I will not."" ""Then what will you have?"" said the merchant. ""I will have none of such presents,"" said the dog; ""but let me fetch your daughter, and bring her to my house."" When the merchant heard this he was grieved, but what he had promised had to be done, so he said to the dog, ""You can come and fetch my daughter after I have been home for a week."" So at the end of the week, the dog came to the merchant's house to fetch his daughter, but when he got there he stayed outside the door, and would not go in. But the merchant's daughter did as her father told her, and came out of the house dressed for a journey and ready to go with the dog. When the dog saw her he looked pleased, and said, ""Jump on my back, and I will take you away to my house."" So she mounted on the dog's back, and away they went at a great pace, until they reached the dog's house, which was many miles off. But after she had been a month at the dog's house she began to mope and cry. ""What are you crying for?"" said the dog. ""Because I want to go back to my father,"" she said. The dog said, ""If you will promise me that you will not stay there more than three days I will take you there. But first of all,"" said he, ""what do you call me?"" ""A great, foul, small-tooth dog,"" said she. ""Then,"" said he, ""I will not let you go."" But she cried so pitifully that he promised again to take her home. ""But before we start,"" he said, ""tell me what you call me."" ""Oh,"" she said, ""your name is Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb."" ""Jump on my back,"" said he, ""and I'll take you home."" So he trotted away with her on his back for forty miles, when they came to a stile. ""And what do you call me?"" said he, before they got over the stile. Thinking she was safe on her way, the girl said, ""A great, foul, small-tooth dog."" But when she said this, he did not jump over the stile, but turned right round again at once, and galloped back to his own house with the girl on his back. Another week went by, and again the girl wept so bitterly that the dog promised to take her to her father's house. So the girl got on the dog's back again, and they reached the first stile, as before, and the dog stopped and said, ""And what do you call me?"" ""Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb,"" she replied. So the dog leaped over the stile, and they went on for twenty miles until they came to another stile. ""And what do you call me?"" said the dog with a wag of his tail. She was thinking more of her father and her own house than of the dog, so she answered, ""A great, foul, small-tooth dog."" Then the dog was in a great rage, and he turned right round about, and galloped back to his own house as before. After she had cried for another week, the dog promised again to take her back to her father's house. So she mounted upon his back once more, and when they got to the first stile, the dog said, ""And what do you call me?"" ""Sweet-as-a-Honeycomb,"" she said. So the dog jumped over the stile, and away they went -- for now the girl made up her mind to say the most loving things she could think of -- until they reached her father's house. When they got to the door of the merchant's house, the dog said, ""And what do you call me?"" Just at that moment the girl forgot the loving things she meant to say and began, ""A great --,"" but the dog began to turn, and she got fast hold of the door latch, and was going to say ""foul,"" when she saw how grieved the dog looked and remembered how good and patient he had been with her, so she said, ""Sweeter-than-a-Honeycomb."" When she had said this she thought the dog would have been content and have galloped away, but instead of that he suddenly stood upon his hind legs, and with his forelegs he pulled off his dog's head and tossed it high in the air. His hairy coat dropped off, and there stood the handsomest young man in the world, with the finest and smallest teeth you ever saw. Of course they were married, and lived together happily.",England,"Source: Sidney Oldall Addy, Household Tales and Other Traditional Remains: Collected in the Counties of York, Lincoln, Derby, and Nottingham (London: David Nutt; Sheffield: Pawson and Brailsford, 1895), no. 1, pp. 1-4.",NA,NA
Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Snake-Prince,"Well, as time went on, luck turned against the merchant. His wife died; one by one he lost his ships; and every year he became poorer and poorer. At last he had lost all his property with the exception of one farm, and he went to live there with his daughters. As they had now no money to hire laborers, the merchant told the girls that they must set to and work on the farm in order that they might gain a living. ""We cannot do farm work,"" replied the two eldest, tossing their heads. ""We are not accustomed to it."" But the youngest, whose name was Rosa, loved her father very dearly; and she at once prepared to do as he wished. So she set to with a will, and digged in the garden, and raked, and planted; and when the fruits and vegetables were grown, she rose early in the morning to gather them for her father to carry to market. Time passed, and after many months tidings came to the merchant that three of his belated ships had come into port laden with costly goods, when he immediately prepared to go to the city. But before mounting his horse, he asked his daughters what each desired as a present. The two eldest begged for fine silken gowns; but when he asked the youngest, she said, ""I want nothing, papa mine, now that I see you released from your poverty."" And when her father pressed her, she said, ""Well, then, papa mine, bring me a rose, a beautiful, sweet-smelling damask rose."" So the merchant set off for the port, and landed his goods. In twelve days' time he had sold them all save the two silken gowns which he had kept for his daughters; but he had found no rose for the youngest. As he was riding home to his farm, it began to rain so heavily that when they came to the open gateway of a house by the wayside, his horse trotted through it into the courtyard. There was no one about, so he put the horse in the stable, and went up to the house. The door stood wide open, so he walked in and sate himself down on a seat in the hall. At once he found by his side coffee and sweetmeats, and a long pipe filled with fragrant tobacco, without his seeing who had brought them. Presently the rain ceased, and the merchant arose and went from chamber to chamber to seek the host and thank him for the shelter and entertainment. Finding no one, however, he was going forth to take his beast from the stable and continue his journey, when, as he crossed the courtyard, he caught sight of a bush of damask roses which had three blossoms on one stem. No sooner, however, had he stretched out his hand and plucked them than there appeared at his feet a snake, who said, ""Ah, thankless man! After I have opened my doors to save thee from the storm, canst not see a rose or two without desiring and plucking them?"" ""I sought through the chambers to find the host and say a ""Thank you"" to him, but found him not,"" the merchant replied. ""Listen to me,"" then said the snake. ""Thou hast three daughters, and thou must bring me the youngest. Think not to thyself that I am only a snake, and cannot come and find thee if thou dost not my bidding."" The poor man asked how many days' grace he would give him; and he granted him forty days. At last he got home to his house; his daughters gathered round him; and when the two eldest had got their gowns he gave the roses to the youngest, and then sat down weeping. ""What is the matter, papa mine, that you weep?"" she asked, anxiously. Then, as the merchant related his adventure, Rosa's sisters began to reproach her, and point their fingers at her, saying, ""Wretched girl that thou art! A gown was not good enough for thee, but thou must have a damask rose, forsooth, that the snake might come and destroy us!"" When her father had also told them of the forty days' grace, Rosa went to her chamber and wrote down the date; and she did not seem at all troubled, though her sisters were continually reproaching her. On the thirty-eighth day she went to her father and said, ""Papa mine, saddle now the horse so that we may go where I am invited."" ""Can I take thee, my darling child, to the snake who will destroy thee?"" cried the unhappy man. ""The snake will not destroy me, if I do his bidding,"" replied Rosa. ""What ill-will can he have against me? Arise, and let us be gone."" She bade farewell to her sisters; she and her father set out on their journey, and on the fortieth day they arrived at the snake's abode. The gate was open, as before, and when the merchant had stabled his horse he led his daughter into the house, and they sate them down. Soon came coffee and sweets, as before, without anyone being seen; and in a little while the snake appeared and said to the merchant, ""So thou hast done my bidding and brought thy daughter?"" ""Yea, I have brought her, as I promised,"" he replied; and when he had kissed and embraced his daughter, he mounted his horse and rode home again. But in a few days he fell ill with grief and took to his bed. So the poor girl was left alone with the snake. And it became the snake's custom, every day when she was taking her coffee after dinner, to climb into her lap and ask her, ""Wilt thou take me for thy husband?"" And she would reply, ""But I am afraid of thee."" And she was very sad and lonely because her father did not come to see her as he had promised. Well, one day, as she was sitting at the table, it suddenly opened before her and disclosed a mirror in which all the world was reflected; and, when she saw in it her father lying ill in bed, she began to weep and tear her hair. The snake, who was in the garden, hearing her cries and her breast-beatings, hurried to her and asked, ""What ails thee, my Rose?"" ""See in the mirror,"" she cried, ""how my father lies nigh unto death!"" Then said the snake, ""Open the table drawer and thou wilt find a ring. Put it on thy finger, and tell me how many days thou wilt be absent?"" ""I will come back,"" she replied, ""as soon as my father recovers."" ""Well, I will give thee thirty-one days' leave. If thou come one day later, thou wilt find me dead on some mound in the garden."" ""Do thyself no harm,"" said the girl. ""When my leave has expired I will return to thee."" The snake ordered supper to be served, and when she had eaten, he said, ""Put the ring on thy tongue, and thou wilt find thyself at home in thy chamber."" Rosa lay down, put the ring on her tongue, and closed her eyes. Her father's servants, passing the door of her chamber, heard her breathing, and ran to tell their young mistresses, who hastened in and found her asleep on her bed. The maiden awoke, and when she found that she was indeed at home again she praised God. Her father was rejoiced to see his Rosa again, and asked her many questions about her life with the snake. When she told him what the snake had said to her every day at dinner time, and that she had replied, ""But I am afraid of thee,"" he said to her, ""My daughter dear, the next time he asks thee that question, do thou answer, ""Yea, I will take thee!"" and we shall see what will hap."" And she promised to say this. Her sisters, however, tried to persuade her not to go back, so that the snake might die and they would be rid of him. But Rosa was indignant, and replied, ""How could I leave my beast to die, who have received such help from him?"" So she remained with her father, whose joy she was, for as many days as she had leave. Then, bidding him and her sisters farewell, she lay down on her bed, put the ring in her mouth, and went back to the snake. When he saw her, he said, ""Ah, thou hast come back to me, my Rose!"" And after dinner, when coffee was served, and he lay in her lap as before and asked, ""Wilt thou take me for thy husband?"" she replied, ""Yea, I will take thee!"" When she had said these words the snake's skin fell off him, and he became a handsome prince. And the table again opened and all the world was seen therein. Then Rosa asked him what manner of man he was, and how he had become a snake. And he told her how that he had fallen under the spell of an enchantress who had changed him into a snake, and had doomed him to retain that shape until he should find a maiden who would consent to marry him. ""But now,"" he said, ""I will return to my kingdom. Thy father and sisters shall be conveyed thither, and then we will hold our wedding."" So they were married, and the prince made his father-in-law his grand vizier. And we will leave them well, and return and find them better -- God be praised!",Greece,"Source: Lucy M. J.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,The Summer and Winter Garden,"A merchant was planning to go to a fair, so he asked his three daughters what he should bring back for them. The oldest one said, ""A beautiful dress."" The second, ""A pair of pretty shoes."" The third, ""A rose."" To find a rose would be difficult, for it was the middle of winter, but because the youngest daughter was the most beautiful, and because she took great pleasure in flowers, the father said that he would do his best to find her one. The merchant was now on his homeward trip. He had a splendid dress for the oldest daughter, a pair of beautiful shoes for the second one, but he had not been able to get a rose for the third one. Whenever he had entered a garden looking for roses, the people just laughed at him, asking him if he believed that roses grew in the snow. He was very sad about this, and as he was thinking about what he might bring his dearest child, he came to a castle. It had an adjoining garden where it was half summer and half winter. On the one side the most beautiful flowers were blossoming -- large and small. On the other side everything was bare and covered with deep snow. The man climbed from his horse. He was overjoyed to see an entire hedge full of roses on the summer side. He approached it, picked one of them, and then rode off. He had already ridden some distance when he heard something running and panting behind him. Turning around, he saw a large black beast, that called out, ""Give me back my rose, or I'll kill you! Give me back my rose, or I'll kill you!"" The man said, ""Please let me have the rose. I am supposed to bring one home for my daughter, the most beautiful daughter in the world."" ""For all I care, but then give me your beautiful daughter for a wife!"" In order to get rid of the beast, the man said yes, thinking that he would not come to claim her. However, the beast shouted back to him, ""In eight days I will come and get my bride."" So the merchant brought each daughter what she had wanted, and each one was delighted, especially the youngest with her rose. Eight days later the three sisters were sitting together at the table when something came stepping heavily up the stairs to the door. ""Open up! Open up!"" it shouted. They opened the door, and were terrified when a large black beast stepped inside. ""Because my bride did not come to me, and the time is up, I will fetch her myself."" With that he went to the youngest daughter and grabbed hold of her. She began to scream, but it did not help. She had to go away with him. And when the father came home, his dearest child had been taken away. The black beast carried the beautiful maiden to his castle where everything was beautiful and wonderful. Musicians were playing there, and below there was the garden, half summer and half winter, and the beast did everything to make her happy, fulfilling even her unspoken desires. They ate together, and she had to scoop up his food for him, for otherwise he would not have eaten. She was dear to the beast, and finally she grew very fond of him. One day she said to him, ""I am afraid, and don't know why. It seems to me that my father or one of my sisters is sick. Couldn't I see them just once?"" So the beast led her to a mirror and said, ""Look inside."" She looked into the mirror, and it was as though she were at home. She saw her living room and her father. He really was sick, from a broken heart, because he held himself guilty that his dearest child had been taken away by a wild beast and surely had been eaten up. If he could know how well off she was, then he would not be so sad. She also saw her two sisters sitting on the bed and crying. Her heart was heavy because of all this, and she asked the beast to allow her to go home for a few days. The beast refused for a long time, but she grieved so much that he finally had pity on her and said, ""Go to your father, but promise me that you will be back here in eight days."" She promised, and as she was leaving, he called out again, ""Do not stay longer than eight days."" When she arrived home her father was overjoyed to see her once again, but sickness and grief had already eaten away at his heart so much that he could not regain his health, and within a few days he died. Because of her sadness, she could think of nothing else. Her father was buried, and she went to the funeral. The sisters cried together, and consoled one another, and when her thoughts finally turned to her dear beast, the eight days were long past. She became frightened, and it seemed to her that he too was sick. She set forth immediately and returned to his castle. When she arrived there everything was still and sad inside. The musicians were not playing. Black cloth hung everywhere. The garden was entirely in winter and covered with snow. She looked for the beast, but he was not there. She looked everywhere, but could not find him. Then she was doubly sad, and did not know how to console herself. She sadly went into the garden where she saw a pile of cabbage heads. They were old and rotten, and she pushed them aside. After turning over a few of them she saw her dear beast. He was lying beneath them and was dead. She quickly fetched some water and poured it over him without stopping. Then he jumped up and was instantly transformed into a handsome prince. They got married, and the musicians began to play again, and the summer side of the garden appeared in its splendor, and the black cloth was all ripped down, and together they lived happily ever after.",Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Von dem Sommer- und Wintergarten,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen (1812), vol. 1, no. 68.","""The Summer and Winter Garden"" was replaced in the Grimms' collection by ""The Singing, Springing Lark,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen (1814), vol. 2, no. 2.

Beauty and the Beast,0425c,Zelinda and the Monster,"There was once a poor man who had three daughters; and as the youngest was the fairest and most civil, and had the best disposition, her other two sisters envied her with a deadly envy, although her father, on the contrary, loved her dearly. It happened that in a neighboring town, in the month of January, there was a great fair, and that poor man was obliged to go there to lay in the provisions necessary for the support of his family; and before departing he asked his three daughters if they would like some small presents in proportion, you understand, to his means. Rosina wished a dress, Marietta asked him for a shawl, but Zelinda was satisfied with a handsome rose. The poor man set out on his journey early the next day, and when he arrived at the fair quickly bought what he needed, and afterward easily found Rosina's dress and Marietta's shawl; but at that season he could not find a rose for his Zelinda, although he took great pains in looking everywhere for one. However, anxious to please his dear Zelinda, he took the first road he came to, and after journeying a while arrived at a handsome garden enclosed by high walls; but as the gate was partly open he entered softly. He found the garden filled with every kind of flowers and plants, and in a corner was a tall rosebush full of beautiful rosebuds. Wherever he looked no living soul appeared from whom he might ask a rose as a gift or for money, so the poor man, without thinking, stretched out his hand, and picked a rose for his Zelinda. Mercy! Scarcely had he pulled the flower from the stalk when there arose a great noise, and flames darted from the earth, and all at once there appeared a terrible monster with the figure of a dragon, and hissed with all his might, and cried out, enraged at that poor Christian, ""Rash man! what have you done? Now you must die at once, for you have had the audacity to touch and destroy my rosebush."" The poor man, more than half dead with terror, began to weep and beg for mercy on his knees, asking pardon for the fault he had committed, and told why he had picked the rose; and then he added, ""Let me depart; I have a family, and if I am killed they will go to destruction"" But the monster, more wicked than ever, responded, ""Listen; one must die. Either bring me the girl that asked for the rose or I will kill you this very moment."" It was impossible to move him by prayers or lamentations; the monster persisted in his decision, and did not let the poor man go until he had sworn to bring him there in the garden his daughter Zelinda. Imagine how downhearted that poor man returned home! He gave his oldest daughters their presents and Zelinda her rose; but his face was distorted and as white as though he had arisen from the dead; so that the girls, in terror, asked him what had happened and whether he had met with any misfortune. They were urgent, and at last the poor man, weeping bitterly, related the misfortunes of that unhappy journey and on what condition he had been able finally to return home. ""In short,"" he exclaimed, ""either Zelinda or I must be eaten alive by the monster."" Then the two sisters emptied the vials of their wrath on Zelinda. ""Just see,"" they said, ""that affected, capricious girl! She shall go to the monster! She who wanted roses at this season. No, indeed! Papa must stay with us. The stupid creature!"" At all these taunts Zelinda, without growing angry, simply said, ""It is right that the one who has caused the misfortune should pay for it. I will go to the monster's. Yes, Papa, take me to the garden, and the Lord's will be done."" The next day Zelinda and her sorrowful father began their journey and at nightfall arrived at the garden gate. When they entered they saw as usual no one, but they beheld a lordly palace all lighted and the doors wide open. When the two travelers entered the vestibule, suddenly four marble statues, with lighted torches in their hands, descended from their pedestals, and accompanied them up the stairs to a large hall where a table was lavishly spread. The travelers, who were very hungry, sat down and began to eat without ceremony; and when they had finished, the same statues conducted them to two handsome chambers for the night. Zelinda and her father were so weary that they slept like dormice all night. At daybreak Zelinda and her father arose, and were served with everything for breakfast by invisible hands. Then they descended to the garden, and began to seek the monster. When they came to the rosebush he appeared in all his frightful ugliness. Zelinda, on seeing him, became pale with fear, and her limbs trembled, but the monster regarded her attentively with his great fiery eyes, and afterward said to the poor man, ""Very well; you have kept your word, and I am satisfied. Now depart and leave me alone here with the young girl."" At this command the old man thought he should die; and Zelinda, too, stood there half stupefied and her eyes full of tears; but entreaties were of no avail; the monster remained as obdurate as a stone, and the poor man was obliged to depart, leaving his dear Zelinda in the monster's power. When the monster was alone with Zelinda he began to caress her, and make loving speeches to her, and managed to appear quite civil. There was no danger of his forgetting her, and he saw that she wanted nothing, and every day, talking with her in the garden, he asked her, ""Do you love me, Zelinda? Will you be my wife?"" The young girl always answered him in the same way, ""I like you, sir, but I will never be your wife."" Then the monster appeared very sorrowful, and redoubled his caresses and attentions, and, sighing deeply, said, ""But you see, Zelinda, if you should marry me wonderful things would happen. What they are I cannot tell you until you will be my wife."" Zelinda, although in her heart not dissatisfied with that beautiful place and with being treated like a queen, still did not feel at all like marrying the monster, because he was too ugly and looked like a beast, and always answered his requests in the same manner. One day, however, the monster called Zelinda in haste, and said, ""Listen, Zelinda; if you do not consent to marry me it is fated that your father must die. He is ill and near the end of his life, and you will not be able even to see him again. See whether I am telling you the truth."" And, drawing out an enchanted mirror, the monster showed Zelinda her father on his deathbed. At that spectacle Zelinda, in despair and half mad with grief, cried, ""Oh, save my father, for mercy's sake! Let me be able to embrace him once more before he dies. Yes, yes, I promise you I will be your faithful and constant wife, and that without delay. But save my father from death."" Scarcely had Zelinda uttered these words when suddenly the monster was transformed into a very handsome youth.

The Bell of Justice,0207c,"Of the Vicissitude of Everything Good, and Especially of a Right Justice","It chanced that a serpent made her nest immediately under the bell-rope, and in due time brought forth young. When they were old enough, one day she conducted them forth to enjoy the fresh air beyond the city. Now, while the serpent was absent, a toad entered and occupied her nest. When, therefore, the former returned with her young, she found the toad in possession, and instantly began an attack. But the latter baffled her attempts, and obstinately maintained his station. The serpent, perceiving her inability to eject the intruder, coiled her tail around the bell-rope, and forcibly rang the bell; as though she had said, ""Descend, judge, and give me justice; for the toad has wrongfully seized my nest."" The judge, hearing the bell, descended; but not seeing anyone, returned. The serpent, finding her design abortive, once more sounded the alarm. The judge again appeared, and upon this occasion, seeing the serpent attached to the bell-rope, and the toad in possession of her nest, declared the whole circumstance to the emperor. ""Go down, my lord,"" said the latter, ""and not only drive away the toad, but kill him; let the serpent possess her right."" All which was done. On a subsequent day, as the king lay in his bed, the serpent entered the bedchamber carrying a precious stone in her mouth. The servants, perceiving this, informed the emperor, who gave directions that they should not harm it; ""for,"" added he, ""it will do me no injury."" The serpent, gliding along, ascended the bed, and approaching the emperor's eyes, let the stone fall upon them, and immediately left the room. No sooner, however, had the stone touched the eyes than their sight was completely restored. Infinitely rejoiced at what had happened, the emperor made inquiry after the serpent, but it was not heard of again. He carefully treasured this invaluable stone, and ended his days in peace.",Gesta Romanorum Application,"Source: Gesta Romanorum, translated from the Latin by Charles Swan, revised and corrected by Wynnard Hooper (London: George Bell and Sons, 1906), no. 105, pp. 182-83.","The Gesta Romanorum (Deeds of the Romans) is a collection of tales compiled about 1300 and intended for the use of Christian preachers.

The Bell of Justice,0207c,The Bell of Atri,"At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town Of ancient Roman date, but scant renown, One of those little places that have run Half up the hill, beneath a blazing sun, And then sat down to rest, as if to say, ""I climb no farther upward, come what may,"" -- The Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame, So many monarchs since have borne the name, Had a great bell hung in the market-place, Beneath a roof, projecting some small space By way of shelter from the sun and rain. Then rode he through the streets with all his train, And, with the blast of trumpets loud and long, Made proclamation, that whenever wrong Was done to any man, he should but ring The great bell in the square, and he, the King, Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon. Such was the proclamation of King John. How swift the happy days in Atri sped, What wrongs were righted, need not here be said. Suffice it that, as all things must decay, The hempen rope at length was worn away, Unraveled at the end, and, strand by strand, Loosened and wasted in the ringer's hand, Till one, who noted this in passing by, Mended the rope with braids of briony, So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine Hung like a votive garland at a shrine. By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt A knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt, Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods, Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods, Who loved his hounds and horses, and all sports And prodigalities of camps and courts; -- Loved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old, His only passion was the love of gold. He sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds, Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds Kept but one steed, his favorite steed of all, To starve and shiver in a naked stall, And day by day sat brooding in his chair, Devising plans how best to hoard and spare. At length he said: ""What is the use or need To keep at my own cost this lazy steed, Eating his head off in my stables here, When rents are low and provender is dear? Let him go feed upon the public ways; I want him only for the holidays."" So the old steed was turned into the heat; Of the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street; And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn, Barked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn. One afternoon, as in that sultry clime It is the custom in the summer time, With bolted doors and window-shutters closed, The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed; When suddenly upon their senses fell The loud alarm of the accusing bell! The Syndic started from his deep repose, Turned on his couch, and listened, and then rose And donned his robes, and with reluctant pace Went panting forth into the market-place, Where the great bell upon its cross-beams swung, Reiterating with persistent tongue, In half-articulate jargon, the old song: ""Some one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!"" But ere he reached the belfry's light arcade He saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade, No shape of human form of woman born, But a poor steed dejected and forlorn, Who with uplifted head and eager eye Was tugging at the vines of briony. ""Domeneddio!"" cried the Syndic straight, ""This is the Knight of Atri's steed of state! He calls for justice, being sore distressed, And pleads his cause as loudly as the best."" Meanwhile from street and land a noisy crowd Had rolled together like a summer cloud, And told the story of the wretched beast In five-and-twenty different ways at least, With much gesticulation and appeal To heathen gods, in their excessive zeal. The Knight was called and questioned; in reply Did not confess the fact, did not deny; Treated the matter as a pleasant jest, And set at naught the Syndic and the rest, Maintaining, in an angry undertone, That he should do what pleased him with his own. And thereupon the Syndic gravely read The proclamation of the King; then said: ""Pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay, But cometh back on foot, and begs its way; Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds, Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds! These are familiar proverbs; but I fear They never yet have reached your knightly ear. What fair renown, what honor, what repute Can come to you from starving this poor brute? He who serves well and speaks not, merits more Than they who clamor loudest at the door. Therefore the law decrees that as this steed Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed To comfort his old age, and to provide Shelter in stall, and food and field beside."" The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all Led home the steed in triumph to his stall. The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee, And cried aloud: ""Right well it pleaseth me! Church-bells at best but ring us to the door; But go not in to mass; my bell doth more: It cometh into court and pleads the cause Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws; And this shall make, in every Christian clime, The Bell of Atri famous for all time.""",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Source: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Tales of a Wayside Inn (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, [1915]), pp. 137-41.","""The Bell of Atri"" is ""The Sicilian's Tale"" from part two of Tales of a Wayside Inn.

The Bell of Justice,0207c,The Dumb Plaintiff,"In early days, when the ruins now crowning the hill were part of a strong fortress, the lord of Eckhardtsberg, wishing to render justice to all men, placed a bell in his tower. He fastened to it a long piece of rope which hung outside the gate, within easy reach of every hand, and bade all those who wished redress to ring it loudly, promising to grant them an immediate hearing. One day the bell pealed loudly, and when in answer to its call the lord of Eckhardtsberg, followed by all his retainers, came out to hear the complaint, he was surprised to find a poor old horse, which, urged by hunger, was trying to chew the end of the hempen rope. One of the bystanders immediately recognized the horse as belonging to a neighboring knight. For many a year the horse had been his favorite steed, had borne him safely through many a fight, but now that it was old and useless the cruel master had turned it out to seek pasture along the highway, where it found but scant subsistence. The lord of Eckhardtsberg, seeing the animal's sorry plight, and hearing how faithfully it had served its master in the days of its youth, declared that in return for its former services it should now be treated with respect, and condemned the unfeeling, avaricious owner to give it a place in his stable and plenty of food as long as it lived.

The Bell of Justice,0207c,The Emperor Charlemagne and the Serpent,"In the days of the early Christian persecution, Felix and Regula, the patron saints of Zürich, were beheaded near this town. Strange to relate, though, immediately after the execution, both martyrs picked up their severed heads, tucked them under their arms, and stalked off to the spot where the minster now stands, where they wound up their marvelous performances by burying themselves comfortably! On the spot where they suffered martyrdom Charlemagne erected a memorial pillar, above which he hung a bell, saying that it could be rung by anyone who had been wronged, and that they should receive immediate justice. During one of his visits to Zürich, Charlemagne took up his abode in the Choristers' House, and while he sat there at table one day he suddenly heard a loud peal from the bell of justice. He immediately dispatched a servant to see what wrong had been done, and was greatly annoyed when the man reported that careful search had failed to reveal the presence of any living creature. A few moments later the bell rang again, but when the servant once more announced that no one was there, the emperor bade his guards hide near the pillar, and seize the miscreant who dared to pull the bell of justice in mere fun. Before long the bell sounded a third time, and a few moments later the guards rushed into the emperor's presence with faces blanched with fear, to report that a snake had coiled itself around the pillar, and seizing the rope in its teeth, tugged until the bell rang forth loud and clear. The emperor immediately rose from table, saying he must see this phenomenon with his own eyes, and followed by all his court went down to the pillar. As he drew near, the snake came forward to meet him, and rising upon its coiled tail, bowed low before the monarch in evident recognition of his exalted station. Then, dropping down to the earth once more, it crept away, turning from time to time, and making signs as if to invite the emperor to follow. The serpent's actions were so eloquent that Charlemagne, understanding them, obediently followed it down to the edge of the water, where, parting the reeds, the snake showed him its nest, in which sat an enormous toad. Charlemagne now bade his guards seize and kill the intruder, and when the snake had bowed its thanks and contentedly coiled itself around its eggs, he went back to his interrupted meal, loudly praising the bell by means of which even dumb animals could appeal for justice. The next day, while the emperor again sat at dinner, the guards rushed in breathlessly to announce the coming of the strange snake. Charlemagne quickly bade them stand aside and not try to hinder the reptile, which now crawled into the room where he sat, climbed upon the table, did obeisance to the emperor, and delicately lifting the cover of his drinking cup, dropped into it a jewel of fabulous price. Then, replacing the cover of the vessel, the snake bowed low again, and creeping down, left the cloister to return to its nest by the lake. According to one version of this legend, Charlemagne set this precious stone in a ring which he gave to his wife, Frastrada. Unknown to him, however, the stone had the magic power of fixing his affections upon its wearer. When the queen, therefore, thought she was about to die, she slipped the ring into her mouth to prevent its falling into the hands of some rival. For eighteen years Charlemagne refused to part with his wife's body, and carried it with him wherever he went. But at the end of that time his minister Turpin discovered the secret of his infatuation, and obtaining possession of the magic stone, soon saw all Charlemagne's affections fixed upon him. As the emperor's devotion proved somewhat of a bore to the old minister, he tried to get rid of the spell by casting the ring into the mineral springs at Aix-la-Chapelle. While out hunting the next day, Charlemagne urged his steed to drink of that water, and when the animal hastily withdrew its foot and refused to approach the pool again, the emperor dismounted to investigate the cause. Touching the imprint of the horse's hoof, Charlemagne discovered that the mud was very warm, for he was near the hottest of these thermal springs. While resting near that pool, he was seized with such an affection for the spot that he soon founded there his capital of Aix-la-Chapelle. In memory of the horse which guided him hither, the Cathedral was built in the shape of a horseshoe, and as Charlemagne could not endure the thought of ever leaving this enchanted neighborhood, he left orders to bury him in the minster of Aix-la-Chapelle. On the spot where Charlemagne's famous bell once hung, at Zurich, stands the Wasserkirche, which now contains a large library with valuable and interesting manuscripts. Charlemagne's great-grandson Louis II. often visited Zürich, where his two pious daughters induced him to build a convent and the Frauenmünster. It is said that the place for these buildings was staked out by angel hands, and that the stakes were connected by a silken string of the finest make. This rope was hung above the altar of the new church, where it remained until the Reformation. It was then removed with many other relics, and served for years as ordinary bell-rope in a private house. The king's daughters, who both became abbesses, long dwelt at Baldern Castle, whence, however, they went down to the Frauenmünster whenever the bell rang for prayers. They even attended the midnight services there, and when it was very dark a stately stag invariably walked before them carrying a flaming torch between its antlers.",Switzerland,"Source: H. A.

Sunken Bells,7070,A Legend of Rostherne Mere,"At Rostherne church long, long ago, Repairs some workmen make, When, as they laboured cheerily oh, They felt the tower shake. As the tower shook, the largest bell Was riven from its place, And eke loud clattering down it fell, And rolling 'gan apace. Down the steep cliff-like bank it rolled That frowns above the mere, Through the fragrant birch and lindens old, At length the lake drew near. It stopped at the brink; hard strove the men To force it up the crag, Back to the tower to strain again Oh 'twas a weary drag! A sulky labourer madly cried, ""Oh, would the Devil had you!"" But scarce he'd spoke when the bell belied To the wave downwards flew.

Sunken Bells,7070,A Legend of Semerwater,"But all so cold their hearts had grown, With cares and fashions splendid, The homeless passed on alone Faint, worn, and unbefriended. * * * * * * * Outside the town a cottage stood, The house of shepherd Malcolm, Who took him in and gave him food, And rest, and warmth, and welcome.

To this humble dwelling came the beggar, but even before he told of his hunger the good dame placed milk, cheese and bread before him. After satisfying his appetite he bestowed on the kind couple a blessing. Beneath their roof he found shelter for the night, and next morning, after again thanking the aged people, he spread his hands to the proud oity and pronounced the following malediction: ""Semmerwater rise!

Sunken Bells,7070,Bomere Pool (1),"They fastened fish-bones to the skirt of his cassock, and set the children to pelt him with mud and stones. The holy man was not dismayed at this; nay, he renewed his entreaties and warnings, so that some few turned from their evil ways and worshipped with him in the little chapel which stood on the bank of a rivulet that flowed down from the mere on the hill-side. The rains fell that December in immense quantities. The mere was swollen beyond its unsual limits, and all the hollows in the hills were filled to overflowing. One day when the old priest was on the hill-side gathering fuel, he noticed that the barrier of peat, earth, and stones, which prevented the mere from flowing into the valley, was apparently giving way before the mass of water above. He hurried down to the village and besought the men to come up and cut a channel for the discharge of the superfluous waters of the mere. They only greeted his proposal with shouts of derision, and told him to go and mind his prayers, and not spoil their feast with his croaking and his kill-joy presence. These heathen were then keeping their winter festival with great revelry. It fell on Christmas Eve. The same night the aged priest summoned his few faithful ones to attend at the midnight mass, which ushered in the feast of our Saviour's Nativity. The night was stormy, and the rain fell in torrents, yet this did not prevent the little flock from coming to the chapel. The old servant of God had already begun the holy sacrifice, when a roar was heard in the upper part of the valley. The server was just ringing the Sanctus bell which hung in the bell-cot, when a flood of water dashed into the church, and rapidly rose till it put out the altar-lights. In a few moments more, the whole building was washed away, and the mere, which had burst its mountain barrier, occupied the hollow in which the village had stood.

Sunken Bells,7070,Kentsham Bell,"And so it came to pass at length that Great Tom of Lincoln, and Great Tom of York, and Great Tom of Christchurch, and Great Tom of Kentsham, were all founded at the same time, and all embarked on board the same vessel, and carried safely to the shore of dear old England. Then they set about landing them, and this was anxious work, but little by little it was done, and Tom of Lincoln, Tom of York, Tom of Christchurch, were safely laid on English ground. And then came the turn of Tom of Kentsham, which was the greatest Tom of all. Little by little they raised him, and prepared to draw him to the shore; but just in the midst of the work the captain grew so anxious and excited that he swore an oath. That very moment the ropes which held the bell snapped in two, and Great Tom of Kentsham slid over the ship's side into the water, and rolled away to the bottom of the sea. Then the people went to the cunning man and asked him what they should do. And he said, ""Take six yoke of white milch-kine, which have never borne the yoke, and take fresh withy bands which have never been used before, and let no man speak a word either good or bad till the bell is at the top of the hill."" So they took six yoke of white milch-kine, which had never borne the yoke, and harnessed them with fresh withy-bands which had never been used, and bound these to the bell as it lay in the shallow water, and long it was ere they could move it. But still the kine struggled and pulled, and the withy-bands held firm, and at last the bell was on dry ground.

Sunken Bells,7070,Rostherne Mere,"The church has noble monuments to the proud family that has lived for centuries here in dignified seclusion, and the graveyard with its mouldering heaps slopes steeply down towards the little lake -- the last a thing quite unexpected here in Cheshire, which is not a lake county at all, and is very still, and peaceful, but melancholy looking, shaded with high and thickly wooded banks, where an everlasting silence seems to reign. Something about the lake in its solitary seclusion seems to have struck the popular imagination. The story goes, that when the church bells were first brought to Rostherne, one of the bells could not in any way be got into the church tower, but, breaking away from ropes and levers, rolled down the steep slope towards the mere, and went on rolling and rolling till it splashed right into the lake, where it was lost in the fathomless abyss. Fathomless indeed is the mere, according to popular estimation, and undoubtedly very deep; a depth of over a hundred feet has been actually measured, and that, for a bit of a mere like Rostherne, is a pretty good record. Now when the bell got to the bottom of the mere, if it has a bottom, it might reasonably have expected to rest there in peace, but that would be to reckon without the mermaids, notoriously addicted to bell-ringing. The connection of the bell with Easter seems to class the legend with those children's stories, which are suggested by the customs of the old faith. For from Good Friday to Easter Sunday the bells are altogether silent, and when children, wondering, ask ""What has become of the bells?"" they are told ""They are gone to Rome to be blessed, but are coming back on Easter morn;"" and so it turns out when at daybreak upon the hallowed morn, the children hear the joyous peal.",Cheshire,"Source (books.google.com): All the Year Round: A Weekly Journal, conducted by Charles Dickens, new series, vol. 32, no. 766 (August 4, 1883), p. 176.

Sunken Bells,7070,The Bells of Brinkburn (2),"But she prevailed at length, and the bells so coveted were removed from the tower and dispatched on horseback on their way to Durham under the care of some monks. They journeyed till they reached the River Font, which, owing to a quantity of rain having fallen, was much swelled. However, they prepared to ford it; but when the horses reached the middle of the stream the bells by some means fell, or, according to the popular belief, were removed from the backs of the horses by miraculous interposition, and sank to the bottom. Owing either to the dangerous state of the stream or from the bells being unwilling to be removed, the exertions of the monks to recover them proved unavailing; so they returned to Brinkburn and reported the disaster. But the Brinkburn prior, determined not to be baffled, sent forthwith a messenger to Durham to request the presence of his brother prior, and both ecclesiasties then proceeded with a full attendance to liberate the imprisoned bells; and lo! the superior abilities of high church functionaries over humble monks was manifest to everyone; for they had no sooner ridden into the stream than the bells were lifted with ease; and, being conveyed to Durham, were lodged there in safety. To this day it is a saying in Coquetdale that ""Brinkburn bells are heard at Durham;"" and Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, assures us that the bells of Brinkburn were removed to the cathedral on the banks of the Wear. Still there are doubters. Walter White, in 1859, says: ""The deep pool where the bells were lost is still to bo seen in the river"" [Coquet] (13); and Mr. Wilson is positive that some years ago ""a fragment of the bell was found buried at the root of a tree on the hill on the opposite side of the river"" (14). Of the bells, William Howitt, in his Visit to Remarkable Places, etc., p. 525, note, says: ""The bell tower looks down upon the Bell Pool, a very deep part of the Coquet, lying concealed beneath the thick foliage of the native trees that jut out from the interstices of the lofty, craggy heights, impending over either side.

It is still a favourite amusement among the young swimmers of the neighbourhood to dive for the bells of Brinkburn, and then it is generally believed that when the bells are found other treasures will be recovered with them.""",Northumberland,"Source: The Denham Tracts: A Collection of Folklore by Michael Aislabie Denham, edited by James Hardy, vol. 2 (London: Published for the Folklore Society by David Nutt, 1895), pp. 132-33.",NA,NA
Sunken Bells,7070,The Bells of Forrabury Church,"The bells were cast; the bells were blessed; and the bells were shipped for Forrabury. Few voyages were more favourable; and the ship glided, with a fair wind, along the northern shores of Cornwall, waiting for the tide to carry her safely into the harbour of Bottreaux. The vesper bells rang out at Tintagel; and the pilot, when he heard the blessed sound, devoutly crossed himself, and bending his knee, thanked God for the safe and quick voyage which they had made. The captain laughed at the superstition of the pilot, as he called it, and swore that they had only to thank themselves for the speedy voyage, and that, with his arm at the helm, and his judgment to guide them, they should soon have a happy landing. The pilot checked this profane speech; but the wicked captain -- and he swore more impiously than ever that all was due to himself and his men -- laughed to scorn the pilot's prayer. ""May God forgive you!"" was the pilot's reply. Those who are familiar with the northern shores of Cornwall will know that sometimes a huge wave, generated by some mysterious power in the wide Atlantic, will roll on, overpowering everything by its weight and force. While yet the captain's oaths were heard, and while the inhabitants on the shore were looking out from the cliffs, expecting, within an hour, to see the vessel, charged with their bells, safe in their harbour, one of these vast swellings of the ocean was seen. Onward came the grand billow in all the terror of its might. The ship rose not upon the waters as it came onward. She was overwhelmed, and sank in an instant close to the land. As the vessel sank, the bells were heard tolling with a muffled sound, as if ringing the death-knell of the ship and sailors, of whom the good pilot alone escaped with life. When storms are coming, and only then, the bells of Forrabury, with their dull, muffled sound, are heard from, beneath the heaving sea, a warning to the wicked; and the tower has remained to this day silent.",Cornwall,"Source (books.google.com): Robert Hunt Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of Old Cornwall, 3rd edition, revised and enlarged (London: Chatto and Windus, 1881), pp. 438-39.

Up from the heart of ocean the mellow music peals, Where the sunlight makes his golden path, and the sea-mew flits and wheels. For many a chequered century, untired by flying time, The bells, no human fingers touch, have rung their hidden chime, Since the gallant ship that brought them, for the abbey on the height, Struck and foundered in the offing, with her sacred goal in sight. And the man who dares on Hallowe'en on the Black Nab to watch, Till the rose-light on St. Hilda's shrine the midnight moonbeams catch, And calls his sweetheart by her name, as, o'er the sleeping seas, The echo of the buried bells comes floating on the breeze, 'Ere another moon on Hallowe'en her eerie rays has shed, Will hear his wedding peal ring out from the church-tower on the Head.",Susan K.

The Bird's Three Precepts,0150,Of Hearing Good Counsel,"An archer, catching a little bird called a nightingale, was about to put her to death. But, being gifted with language, she said to him, ""What will it advantage you to kill me? I cannot satisfy your appetite. Let me go, and I will give you three rules, from which you will derive great benefit, if you follow them accurately."" Astonished at hearing the bird speak, he promised her liberty on the conditions she had stated. ""Hear, then,"" said she. ""Never attempt impossibilities. Secondly, do not lament an irrecoverable loss. Thirdly, do not credit things that are incredible. If you keep these three maxims with wisdom, they will infinitely profit you."" The man, faithful to his promise, let the bird escape. Winging her flight through the air, she commenced a most exquisite song, and, having finished, said to the archer, ""You are a silly fellow, and have today lost a great treasure. There is in my bowels a pearl bigger than the egg of an ostrich."" Full of vexation at her escape, he immediately spread his nets and endeavored to take her a second time, but she eluded his art. ""Come into my house, sweet bird,"" said he, ""and I will show you every kindness. I will feed you with my own hands, and permit you to fly abroad at pleasure."" The nightingale answered, ""Now I am certain you are a fool, and pay no regard to the counsel I gave you: 'Regret not what is irrecoverable.' You cannot take me again, yet you have spread your snares for that purpose. Moreover, you believe that my bowels contain a pearl larger than the egg of an ostrich, when I myself am nothing near that size! You are a fool, and a fool you will always remain."" With this consolatory assurance she flew away. The man returned sorrowfully to his own house, but never again obtained a sight of the nightingale.

The Bird's Three Precepts,0150,The Three Proverbs,"A rich man was once walking about in his garden. He was cheerful and happy. Suddenly he noticed a small bird that had been captured in a small net. He took hold of it and was more than a little surprised when it began to speak, saying, ""Give me my freedom, dear man! Of what use is it to you to lock me in a cage? Looking at me will not please you, for I do not have beautiful feathers. I cannot entertain you, for I do not sing like other birds. And I cannot provide you with nourishment. I am much too small for that. But I will tell you three wise teachings if you will give my freedom."" The master of the garden looked at the little creature and said, ""If you do not sing then of course you cannot entertain me. Let me hear your wisdom, and if it teaches me anything, I will give you your freedom."" Then the little bird said, ""First: Do not grieve over things that have already happened. Second: Do not wish for that which is unattainable. Third: Do not believe in that which cannot be possible."" Then the master of the garden said, ""You have indeed taught me something. I will give you your freedom."" Letting the bird fly away, he thought seriously about its words. Then he heard it laughing quietly. Its voice came from a tree where the bird was sitting. ""Why are you laughing so cheerfully?"" shouted the man. ""About my easily won freedom,"" answered the bird, ""and more than that, about the foolishness of humans who believe they are smarter than all other creatures. If you had been smarter, only just as smart as I am, then you would now be the richest man."" ""How would that have been possible?"" asked the master of the garden. The bird replied, ""If, instead of giving me my freedom, you had kept me, for in my body I have a diamond the size of a hen's egg."" The man stood there as though he were petrified. After recovering from the surprise, he began to speak, ""You think that you are happy because I gave you your freedom. But summer will soon be over and winter with its storms will arrive. The brooks will freeze over, and you will not be able to find a single drop of water to quench your thirst. The fields will be covered with snow, and you will not find anything to eat. But I will give you a warm place where you can freely fly around, and you can have as much water and bread as you want. Come down, and I will show you that you are better off with me than with your freedom."" Thus spoke the master of the garden, but the little bird laughed louder than before, making the man even angrier. ""You are still laughing?"" asked the man. ""Of course,"" replied the bird. ""See, you gave me my freedom on account of the teachings that I gave you, and now you are so foolish that you do not take the teachings to heart. I earned my freedom fairly, but you forgot my teachings after only a few minutes. You should not grieve over things that have already happened, but still you are grieving that you gave me my freedom. You should not wish for things that you cannot obtain, and yet you want me, for whom freedom is my whole life, to voluntarily enter a prison. You should not believe that which is impossible, and yet you believe that I am carrying about inside my body a diamond as large as a hen's egg, although I myself am only half the size of a hen's egg.""

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Emperor's Daughter and the Swineherd,"When she reached the age of marriage she said to her father that she would marry only the man who could guess what her birthmarks were, be he the poorest man in the world, even a beggar. If he could guess her birthmarks, she would marry him. This proclamation was made to the whole world, and many emperors and kings sought her hand, but none could guess what the birthmarks were. One day she was walking with her maidens-in-waiting when they met a poor lad who was tending a sow with three suckling piglets. Seeing the cute piglets, she stepped aside from the other maidens and approached the swineherd, who was standing near the sow, and asked him, ""Would you give me one of the sow's piglets?"" ""Yes, and as payment you will only have to loosen your veil so I can see your face."" Suspecting nothing, the emperor's daughter uncovered her face, and the swineherd saw the birthmark on her forehead. He then caught a piglet and handed it to her. She returned home happily, accompanied by the other maidens. When in the evening the swineherd drove the sow with two piglets home, his father accosted him with curse words: ""Where is the other piglet? Damn you!"" Not wanting to admit what had happened, he said that he had taken a nap and that the piglet had disappeared while he was asleep. Meanwhile the emperor's daughter showed the piglet that she had won to her father and mother, and it was so cute that they both fell in love with it immediately. They told their daughter that it would be good if she could get another one, to which she answered that the swineherd had two more. Thus the next day she again went out with her maidens-in-waiting, found the swineherd, and asked for another piglet. The lad agreed, on the condition that she would let him see her bosom. She immediately undid her bodice, and after he had seen the birthmark on her breast he gave her the second piglet. The delighted princess hurried home with the piglet, and the swineherd returned to his home with the sow and only one piglet. His father scolded him even more severely than before. On the third day the princess went out once again and asked the swineherd for the third piglet. He promised it to her if she would uncover her legs and let him see her knees. This she did, and after seeing the birthmark he gave her the third piglet. Then she returned to her home, and he to his; and his parents scolded him all the more severely. Some time later the lad asked his mother to bake a flatbread, roast a chicken, fill a bottle with wine, and prepare a bunch of basil for him. She did this, then put it all into a knapsack. He threw the knapsack over his shoulders and went on his way, saying to his mother as he left, ""Mother, I'm going to the emperor's daughter to guess her birthmarks. Perhaps I'll be lucky, and with God's help will guess them."" His mother replied, ""Oh, my child, we will never be so lucky!"" To which he said, ""I have hope, if God is willing."" Thus he made his way to the emperor's court, where a Turk had arrived, also wanting to guess the princess's birthmarks. Both were taken before the princess, and the Turk said to the swineherd, ""My friend, you speak first. I already know what I am going to say."" With this the lad began: ""Maiden, do you have a star on your forehead?"" These words had barely escaped his lips when the Turk said, ""My goodness, we have the same thoughts!"" The maiden took off her veil and said to the lad, ""You guessed right. Continue. What kind of birthmark do I have on my breast?"" The youth answered: ""A sun."" And the Turk interrupted, ""So help me, I was about to say the same thing."" The maiden uncovered her breast and said to the youth, ""You were right on that one as well. Now tell me, what do I have on my knee?"" The youth: ""A moon."" The Turk: ""By my holy faith, what will we do now? I knew that as well."" Thus there was confusion as to who should get the maiden. She, of course preferred the Turk, who was a handsome, well-dressed young man, whereas the swineherd was standing there in tattered clothes. Finally it was decided that the two of them should spend the night with the maiden. Whoever she was facing the next morning would be the winner. That evening they all went to bed, and the maiden turned to face the Turk. Then the swineherd got up and went outside. The princess said to the Turk, ""Follow him, and whatever he does, you should do as well."" Once outside, the swineherd squatted down in the dark, took the flatbread, the roasted chicken, and the wine out of his knapsack, then began to eat and drink. In the darkness, the Turk thought that he saw the swineherd doing that which even the emperor has to get out his saddle to do, so he too squatted down and strained until he had relieved himself. Meanwhile the Turk noticed that the swineherd was eating something, and thinking that he was eating his own dung, the Turk began to eat what he himself had just left on the ground. After eating all he wanted, the swineherd rubbed the basil over his face. Thinking that the swineherd was rubbing filth on his face, the Turk did the same thing with rest of his own dung. With this the two of them returned to the princess: one at her one side, the other at her other side. Once again the maiden turned to face the Turk, but unable to stand the stink of the dung, she immediately turned toward the swineherd, who smelled like basil. When they looked in on her in the morning she was still facing him. The swineherd remained at court as the emperor's son-in-law. He sent for his father and mother, and they all lived there happily until they died.",Slavic,"Source (books.google.com): Friedrich S.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Enchanted Lambs,"This wonderful news spread over the whole world, so that wooers by thousands came from all lands to sue for the princess's hand. But all in vain. A countless number of them were changed into lambs. The news came also to the ears of a youth who was as poor as a church mouse, but who was as sharp as a needle for all that. His desire to possess the beautiful maiden and half the empire grew so strong that he decided to try his fortune; not, however, by suing at once for the maiden's hand, but by seeing her first and asking her something. Arrived at the emperor's court, what wonders does he see! Lambs of all kinds pressed around him. God only knows how many there were. They swarmed about him, a pitiful sight and a warning example that might well turn him from his project. He would have gone back, but at the gate was a monster of a man, wrapped in a blood-red mantle, with wings, and an eye in the middle of his forehead, who cried out in a commanding voice, ""Halt! Where are you going? Go back, or you are lost!"" So he went back and caused himself to be announced to the emperor's daughter, who was already waiting for him. She said to him, ""Did you come to get me for your wife?"" He answered, ""No, Imperial Highness; but as I understood that you were thinking of marrying at the first favorable opportunity, I come to ask you if you need more bridal clothes."" ""What kind of clothes have you to offer?"" she asked. He answered, ""I have a skirt of marble, a bodice of dew, a head-dress of threads made from the sun's rays, with a clasp of the moon and stars; then I have shoes of pure gold which were neither sewed nor made by a smith. So, tell me, do you wish to buy these things or not? You have but to command, and I will bring them to you, but only on one condition. When you try these things on, piece by piece, there shall be no one present but only us two. If they fit we shall soon come to terms; if not, I will never offer them to another soul, but will lay them aside and keep them for my own bride."" The princess agreed to this condition and gave him the order to bring the garments. And, really, he brought them to her. God only knows where he found them and how he came to possess them; it is enough for us to know that he kept his word. They shut themselves up in a room, and first she tried on the skirt, while he watched narrowly to see if by chance he could discover the mole. To his joy he saw it under her right knee -- a little golden star; but not the slightest change in his face betrayed his discovery. He only thought in his heart, ""It is well for me today and for all time!"" Then the princess tried on the bodice and all the other things, and they fitted her as if she had been poured into them. They agreed as to the price; she paid it on the spot; he packed up his gold and departed. After a few days, having dressed himself in the finest suit that could be bought for money, he came back to sue for the hand of the emperor's daughter. When he appeared before the emperor he said, ""Worthy emperor, I come to woo your daughter. Make no objections; give her to me!"" ""Good!"" answered the emperor; ""but do you know how my daughter's hand is won? Take good care, for if you do not guess the mole you are lost; but if you do guess it she will be yours, and the half of my empire into the bargain."" The youth bowed to the emperor and said, ""My greetings, O emperor and father-in-law! If that is the case she is mine. She has a little star under the right knee."" The emperor was not a little surprised that he could know this, but there was nothing for it but to yield, and so the youth was married to the princess. When the emperor proceeded to give him the half of his empire the new-made son-in-law said to him, ""I willingly leave this half of your empire to you if you are ready to restore these poor souls to their former condition."" The emperor answered that this was no longer in his power, but lay in the hands of his daughter, ""who now,"" he added, is your wife."" So he turned to his wife with this request, and she answered: ""Cut the vein under the famous mole. Let every lamb touch the end of its tongue to the blood and moisten its underlip with it, and they will all be changed to men and live as before."" He did as she directed, and when the lambs had all assumed the forms of men again they were invited as wedding guests. Thus the youth took the maiden home amid song and chime of bells, and there he treated everybody royally to meat and drink, until finally they took their homeward way. But he stayed there with his young wife, and God knows what fortunes they met with in life that are all forgotten now. ""I am sorry you have forgotten anything, grandmother,"" said the little boy. ""It is not dark yet, and I wanted a longer story."" ""It is not I who forgot,"" answered the grandmother. ""I remember every word as it was told to me."" ""It must have been your great-grandmother,"" observed the little boy.

Our shepherd already knew about her birthmark, so he volunteered to herd the three hundred hares. They were counted out to him, but he had scarcely gone into the open with them when they all scampered away from him. However, the little gray man gave him a flute, and when he blew into it every last one of the hares came running back to him. Now first the nobleman's daughter, then her mother, and finally her father -- all in disguise -- came to the shepherd to beg a hare from him. And each got one for a very high price, but when the shepherd blew into his flute the hares broke loose and ran back to him. Thus only the third task remained. The suitors were all invited to a gathering, but none of them, however noble they all were, was able to tell an unknown truth. Finally the shepherd rose from his seat in the back of the hall and began to relate what price he had received for the sale of the hares.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Pearl Queen,"The good fishing people were very fond of her, especially the children, because at every visit she would scatter a quantity of pearls onto the bank, and then motion to them that they should gather them up. The little ones busied themselves gathering up the pearls, delighted at their glistening colors. Then the fishing people -- men and women -- brought the pearl queen a something to eat: fish, bread, and good wine. The lovely maiden was friendly toward them all, ate a few bites and drank a little wine. When the beautiful stranger was expected to come ashore, princes and noblemen from foreign lands would often arrive, hoping to see the beautiful maiden, and perhaps to gain her hand in marriage, for it was said far and wide that she possessed earthly wealth equal to her physical beauty. However, they all left disappointed. The noble maiden demanded from each suitor that he fulfill three tasks that she gave him. Until now these tasks had been too difficult. No one had been able to fulfill them, so all the noble suitors had had to depart saddened and ashamed. The maiden's first task was to guess what color her hair was, for she always kept her head fully covered with a thick shawl. No one had guessed correctly, although they had named all the colors: black, red, blond, brown, white, green, gray, and blue. The second task was to put the maiden's necklace around one's own neck. If the glistening peals then turned cloudy it was an evil sign, causing the maiden to weep. Her tears turned to bright pearls and affixed themselves to the necklace. When she put the necklace back around her own neck the pearls again glistened brilliantly and marvelously. The third task was to guess what the maiden wore next to her breast. No one was able to guess. Thus no one gained the maiden's favor, nor her hand in marriage, even if he were the wealthiest prince. She remained a mystery. All attempts failed to discover more about her and her homeland. When her little ship of pearls left shore it quickly disappeared from sight. However, at certain times she appeared again, was as friendly and lovely as before, and scattered pearls on the bank. A little boy was there whom she favored more than all the other children. She would take him into her arms and squeeze him warmly. The boy loved the beautiful, gracious lady as well. However, when he grew older he became shy and bashful, no longer daring to gather the pearls. In any event, he was mostly at sea fishing with his father. The maiden had gone ashore several times without seeing her dear fisher-boy. This saddened her, for in her heart she had chosen this handsome youth, hoping that one day he would be able to solve the three tasks, and then follow her to the beautiful Isle of Pearls, her homeland. When she again came ashore without seeing her beloved fisher-lad, after casting off from land she resolved to return that same evening and to invisibly approach him. After the golden moon had risen, mirroring itself in the water, the little ship of pearls landed again on the familiar shore. Her beloved was now sound asleep in his little hut. The lovely maiden stepped into his little room and bent silently over the sleeping lad, who had only moss for a mattress. She took off her necklace and hung it around the lad's neck. When the pearls remained as bright and clear as before, great joy streamed through her loving heart! She gently kissed her beloved and left. She returned every evening, each time hanging the pearls around the lad's neck, and they always remained bright and glistening. The lad was also in love with the beautiful pearl queen, but was too shy and modest to openly approach her. One night while she was at the youth's bedside he awoke, but remained still, so she thought that he was asleep. Again she took the string of pearls from her neck, hung it around his neck, then wept warm tears onto his cheeks. Taking the shawl from her head, she used it to wipe away the tears. The youth saw that her hair was golden. Then she pulled aside her breast-cloth, and he saw a glistening mirror on her breast that softly and beautifully reflected his own image. Upon leaving she became sad, for she knew that if the string of pearls became cloudy even a single time on her beloved's neck, that she would never again be able to approach him. The time came when the beautiful pearl queen again came ashore near the fishing village. In her customary manner she scattered pearls for the happy children. This time many princes and noblemen had arrived in order to court the wealthy and beautiful princess. The fisher-lad was there as well, standing at the rear. He gathered courage and approached the suitors. His turn came at last, after all the others had failed and shamefully stepped aside. He modestly advanced and asked for the three tasks. Glowing with pleasure the maiden gave them to him, then cast a secret and pleading glance toward heaven, praying that her beloved youth would be able to solve them. The handsome fisher-lad bowed respectfully before the lovely maiden and said: ""Oh, your hair must be golden."" In that instant the shawl fell from her head, and her golden locks flowed down. Then the happy maiden hung the string of pearls around the youth's neck, and they remained pure and glistening. The fisher-lad spoke again: ""And your breast must be a clear, beautiful mirror, noble maiden!"" And that instant her breast-cloth fell to the ground, revealing the clear mirror on the maiden's breast. The mirror reflected a beautiful, gentle image: that of the youth. A jubilant cheer and joyful music sounded forth from the ship of pearls, and a circle of beautiful women and radiant men came forth from the ship. They led the blessed couple back aboard, and the ship glided away to the magical Isle of Pearls, now the homeland of the lovely bride and the fisher lad. And they never, never returned.","Germany, Ludwig Bechstein","Source (books.google.com): Ludwig Bechstein, ""Die Perlenkönigin Deutsches Märchenbuch (Leipzig: Georg Wigand's Verlag, 1846), pp. 202-205.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Pig-Boy and the Princess,"Now it happened that one day he drove the pigs near the royal princess's summer palace. He lay down beneath an oak tree in the warm sunshine and had his piglets dance to his flute. The princess saw this from her window, and she thought that they were so cute and funny that at once she sent her maid down to the lad to ask him if he wouldn't sell her one of the piglets. ""Greetings from the princess,"" said the maid to the lad. ""She would like to know if one of your lovely colorful piglets would be for sale. ""They're not for sale,"" said the lad, ""but one can be earned. Just tell your princess that if I may sleep one night in the same bed with her chambermaid, I would be happy to give her one of my piglets."" The maid returned to the princess with this message, and the princess wanted one of the cute little piglets so badly that she let the lad have his way. After receiving the piglet she bought herself a flute to make it dance, but it would not dance. She played the most beautiful dance tunes that she knew, petted the animal, and stroked it, but it would not dance. ""Oh, dear,"" said the princess. ""The little animal won't dance, because it doesn't have a playmate. I'll have to see if I cannot get one for him."" She was very sad that her little piglet would not dance. The next day the lad was once again tending his animals near the castle. The princess sent to him a second time, asking if one of his two piglets were not for sale. ""Not for sale,"" said the lad once again. ""But it can be earned. If I may sleep a second night in the same bed with the princess's chambermaid, then I'll give the princess one of the piglets. Nothing else will do."" The princess, who wanted the piglet ever so badly, let the lad have his way. Later, after she had the second piglet, she brought the two together, took out her flute, and played many lovely tunes, but the piglets did not dance. Now she concluded that the problem was with the flute, so she waited impatiently until the lad came back to see if she could not get the third piglet as well as the flute from him. The lad did indeed come back the next day. He lay down beneath the oak tree in the warm sunshine and had his piglet dance to his flute: the gallop, waltzes, and -- in short -- all the dances that were popular in the country. The princess sent to him and asked if the third piglet, together with the flute, were for sale. ""Not for sale,"" said the lad once again. ""But they can be earned. If tonight I may sleep with the princess in her bed, then I will give her my piglet, together with the flute."" When the princess heard this, it was a little too much for her, but she wanted the piglet and the flute so badly that she asked if it wouldn't be all the same if he could sleep yet another night with the chambermaid in her bed. ""No!"" answered the lad. ""Only the princess will do. If she won't agree, it's all right with me. I'll just keep my piglet and my flute."" Thus the princess saw that there was no other way. She had to let the lad do what he wanted to do. Now she had all three of the colorful little piglets together, and they danced ever so cheerfully to the sound of the flute: the gallop, waltzes, and -- in short -- all the dances that were popular in the country. This delighted the princes so much that she never grew tired of playing for the little animals. On the other hand, now that the lad no longer had his piglets and his flutes, he was no longer happy in these parts, so he set forth into the wide world. Now it happened that soon afterward the king proclaimed far and wide that whoever would be able to guess what kind of birthmark the princess had on her body could have her as a wife, be he rich or poor, nobleman or commoner. However, anyone who attempted, but guessed wrong, would lose his head, and thus his life. When the pig-boy heard this news he immediately set forth toward home, thinking that he would be able to solve the riddle. Underway he met up with a priest who asked him where he had come from, where he was going, and what sort of business was taking him there. ""I am going to the king's court,"" replied the lad, ""to see if I can't guess the princess's birthmark."" The priest said, ""Do you already know something about it, my son? Otherwise you'll likely lose your head and thus your young life."" ""I don't know for sure,"" said the lad, ""but one thing is certain: The princess has three hairs on one side of her body."" Hearing this, the priest thought that now that he that knew the answer he would seek the prize for himself by getting ahead of the boy if at all possible. ""I am seeking the same goal as you are, my son,"" he said to the boy. ""If it's all right with you, let's walk on together."" The lad agreed, and together they made their way to the royal court. They announced themselves to the king, and as soon as he realized why they had come he sent for the executioner who made ready his bare sword. ""So!"" said the king. ""Let us begin. The priest can be first, and then the pig-boy. Reverend sir, what kind of birthmark does my daughter have on her body?"" The cunning priest, happy that his turn came first, quickly spoke out: ""Three hairs on one side!"" ""Right!"" said the king, ""but, my dear sir, on which side? And how long are they? And how thick are they? And what do they look like?"" The priest, not knowing what to say, just stood there with his mouth hanging open. ""Listen up, priest!"" said the king. ""Rightfully you would now be made shorter by one head, but because you guessed at least something right your life will be spared this time."" Then he turned to the pig-boy and said, ""Now, my lad, it's your turn to guess. What is the birthmark that my daughter has on her body?"" ""Three hairs on one side."" ""Right, my son! But on which side?"" ""On her left side."" ""Right! But how long are they? And how thick are they? And what do they look like?"" ""With all respect, your majesty, they are as long and as thick as knitting needles, and they are -- I think -- gold colored."" ""Right, my son,"" cried the king. ""You have guessed correctly, and have rightfully won the princess."" Thus the priest had to go on his way shamefully, but the pig-boy married the beautiful princess.","Germany, Wilhelm Busch","Source (Internet Archive): Wilhelm Busch, ""Der Schweinejunge und die Prinzessin,"" Ut ôler Welt: Volksmärchen, Sagen, Volkslieder und Reime (Munich: Lothar Joachim Verlag, 1910), no. 39, pp. 104-106.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Princess's Birthmarks,"On saying farewell, his father gave him a wallet and a golden box, things to remind him of his home. Some time later he found work with a squire to look after the sheep. On the squire's farm was a mound where the sheep were not allowed to graze for fear that a wild troll might capture them. On his first morning the new shepherd drove the sheep to the mound, then sat down to eat his lunch. The troll suddenly appeared and asked for some of his lunch, and the shepherd gave him half. Then the troll said, ""Because you have shared your lunch with me, all will go well with your sheep."" Thus every day the lad went to the mound and shared his lunch with the troll, and in return the troll showed him the best places to graze the sheep. One day the troll said to the lad, ""If you will continue to serve here until you are eighteen, I'll help you."" The boy agreed to this and served four more years (he was fourteen when he started there). When the time came for him to leave, the troll said, ""You should now go to the king's castle and take service there as a swineherd. I'll give you this flute, and whenever you blow into it the pigs will dance ever so nicely. The lad thanked him and went on his way. The king had nine pigs, and the lad took them into the woods. On returning to the castle with them he blew into the flute, and the pigs jumped about and danced ever so beautifully. Now the princess saw the dancing pigs from her bedroom window, and she wanted to have one of them. The next day she secretly went into the woods and asked the swineherd if his pigs could indeed dance. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Do you want to see them dance?"" He blew into the flute, and the pigs danced. ""Will you sell me one of the pigs?"" ""I can do that,"" he said. ""How much will it cost? But it must be a pig that can dance."" In payment he asked only to see her garters. This displeased the princess, but the swineherd would accept nothing else, so in the end she lifted up her skirts, and he gave her one of the pigs. Back at the castle she sent for her musicians, but for all their skill they could not make the pig dance. All the pig would do was to squeal and scream. So the next day she returned to the woods and complained to the swineherd. ""Your pig must have been too lonely to dance,"" explained the swineherd. ""You should buy another pig."" ""Yes, but what will I have to pay for this one?"" She would have to show him her breasts. So she undid her bodice and let him look, and he saw that she had two silver hairs below her left armpit and one golden hair below her right armpit. Thus she got the second pig, but upon returning to the castle it too would not dance. So the next day she went once again into the woods to complain to the swineherd. ""I can give you a dancing pig,"" he promised, ""but first you must show me your bare arms."" By now she was used to such requests, so she rolled up her sleeves. He saw that on her left arm was a blood-red spot as large as a ducat. It was a birthmark that she had been born with. So she got the third pig and returned home with it, but it too refused to dance, however much her musicians played and drummed. That evening when the lad returned to the castle with his six pigs the king noticed that three were missing, and because the swineherd could not explain how they had disappeared, the king dismissed him forthwith. Now in those same days the king issued a proclamation throughout the realm that whoever might guess the princess's birthmarks could have her in marriage. Many suitors arrived on the appointed day. The king saw them one by one, but none guessed right. All the while the swineherd was hiding behind a door where he could hear everything. One of the suitors was a good-looking student, and he pumped the swineherd for an answer to the riddle. ""I guess she has two silver hairs beneath right armpit and a gold hair beneath her left armpit,"" replied the swineherd, so when the student presented himself, this is the answer that he gave. ""Not true!"" shouted the swineherd. ""She has a gold hair beneath her right armpit and two silver hairs beneath her left armpit."" ""Hold your tongue, boy!"" said the king, who liked the good-looking student. ""Just what are you saying?"" ""What I say is true!"" said the swineherd, and it turned out that he was right. The king then asked the student, ""Can you tell me on which arm the princess has a birthmark?"" ""Her right arm."" ""Not true!"" shouted the swineherd. On her left arm is a red mark the size of a ducat. Her arm was examined, and everyone in the hall said, ""The boy is right."" Nonetheless, the king refused to accept the swineherd, and instead he set an additional task. That night each suitor would go to bed on either side of the princess, the one she was facing the next morning would be the winner. Before bedtime the king gave a feast for the judges and some of the suitors. The student thought himself in seventh heaven, for he was sure that he would win the princess, and thus he drank until he was quite drunk. But the swineherd was not so foolish. Finally the three went to bed, and the bedroom door was locked behind them. The princess turned to face the student, for she favored him. Now before bedtime the swineherd had purchased a bag of prunes and raisins, and as he lay there he munched on them. In the night the student became ill from his overeating and overdrinking. Needing to vomit, he tried to go outside, but the door was locked, so he had to puke in the corner. When he returned to bed the princess smelled his breath, and it was so foul that she turned toward the swineherd, whose breath smelled much better. They all slept until daybreak, and when the king looked in on them she was facing the swineherd. Thus the case was settled. Nothing more could be said against the swineherd. ""Now that you have won the contest,"" said the king, ""tell us about your possessions."" The boy told him of the wallet and the golden box. These were his entire inheritance, and he had not opened them since leaving home. The king wanted to see them, and opening the wallet he saw photographs of the lad's father and mother, and he recognized the father as his own twin brother. When their father had died they had battled each other over the kingdom. The loser had escaped into the woods and had become the leader of a band of robbers. Then they opened the golden box, and it contained a rich inheritance. The wallet was given to the king, for he had often thought about his brother and longed for him. Now he knew that he was still alive. Of course the lad should marry the princess, and their wedding was soon celebrated. He received half the kingdom at once, along with a dowry, and when the king died he received the second half as well.",Denmark,"Source (books.google.com): Evald Tang Kristensen, ""Prinsessens Mærker,"" Jyske Folkeminder: Især fra Hammerum Herred, Femte Samling, (Copenhagen: Konrad Jørgensen, 1881), no. 12, pp. 89-95.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Rivals,"Now another emperor's son was her lover, and he knew the marks. At the same time there was a swineherd who tended a sow with twelve golden piglets in the forest. The princess saw the piglets and asked the lad to sell one of them to her. ""They are not for sale,"" he replied, ""but if you will lift your skirts to your knees, I will give one of them to you."" She looked around, making sure that no one else could see, then lifted her skirts to her knees. The lad gave her a piglet. The emperor was delighted with the little animal, for never before had he seen a golden piglet. The next morning the princess went into the woods again, wanting to buy another piglet. ""They are not for sale,"" said the swineherd, but if you will lift your skirts to your waist, I will give one of them to you."" She did what he wanted, and took the second piglet back to the castle. The emperor was even happier with the new piglet than before. The third morning the princess returned to the woods, but the swineherd would not sell her a another piglet. ""But,"" he said, ""if you will take off your shift and turn around in front of me three times, I will give you another piglet."" The princess did what he wanted, and the swineherd was able to see the sun on her forehead, the moon on her breast, and the stars on her back. The princess returned to the castle with her prize, and the emperor rejoiced with the new golden piglet. He now set the time for the great contest to guess his daughter's birthmarks. One of the suitors was another emperor's son. This prince was her lover, and he knew the marks. In the end, both the swineherd and the prince identified the marks. To settle the matter, the ministers declared that for one night the two rivals and the princess should all three sleep together in one bed. Whoever the princess was embracing the following morning would win her hand in marriage. The swineherd hid a snack in his nightshirt: bread, fruit, and sweets. In the night he began to eat the sweets, and the princess said, ""I'm hungry, what are you eating?"" ""I'm eating my lips."" ""Give me some."" So he gave here some of his sweets, which she ate, saying, ""Oh, they are sweet!"" The prince heard this and replied, ""Mine are still sweeter,"" upon which he took out a knife, cut off his own lips, and handed them to the princess. She threw them onto the floor. Next the swineherd gave the princess some fruit, claiming that it was his nose. ""Oh, how sweet!"" said the princess. ""Mine is still sweeter,"" replied the emperor's son, then cut off his own nose and handed it to the princess. Immediately she threw it onto the floor. Finally the swineherd gave the princess some bread, saying that it was his ears. As before the prince cut off his own ears and handed them to the princess, who threw them onto the floor. The prince bled to death, and the princess pushed him out of the bed onto the floor, then took the swineherd into her arms. The next morning the swineherd and the princess were found embracing one another. They dressed the swineherd in clothes befitting an emperor, then he and the princess were joined together in marriage.",Bukovina,"Source (Internet Archive): Franz Miklosich, ""Die Nebenbuhler,"" Märchen und Lieder der Zigeuner der Bukowina, no. 7, pp. 29-30.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Shepherd and the King's Daughter,"The boy refused, saying, ""I cannot give you one, for my mother will scold me if I do, as we have nothing in the world except these four lambs."" The princess, however, had taken so great a fancy for a lamb that she would not be refused, and at last said, ""Only let me have this one and I will give you any price you like to ask."" The boy, seeing that the princess would not go away without a lamb, considered a little how he could get rid of her, and then he told her that he would give her one if she would show him one of her shoulders. To his great surprise the princess, without any hesitation, pushed her mantle aside and showed him her bare white arm, and he noticed that on the shoulder there was a mark like a star. He was obliged now to give her one of his lambs, and when he went home in the evening he told his mother that he had fallen asleep at noon, and that when he awoke, one of the lambs had vanished, and he could not find it anywhere. Then his mother scolded him very much, saying, ""I see you will bring me to the beggar's staff with your carelessness! Tomorrow you must take these three lambs out to graze very early, and look well about for the lost one. And if you don't find it you had better never let me set eyes on you again."" At dawn the next day the boy took the three lambs to graze in the same field, and sat down to consider how he could get back the lamb he had lost. At noon, when no one was about, the king's daughter came out of the palace and said to him, ""Young shepherd, give me another lamb, and ask what you please in return."" But the boy answered, ""No! I dare not give you another; I have suffered enough for the one I gave you yesterday! So please go and bring me my lamb back."" This the princess refused to do, and said, ""It is quite useless to speak of such a thing. But tell me, did you notice anything particular on my shoulder?"" The youth answered, ""Yes, I saw a star!"" ""Ah!"" exclaimed the princess; ""for that you can never pay me enough, and yet you want your lamb back!"" So they almost quarreled, for the king's daughter persisted in begging him to give her another lamb, and the young shepherd insisted that she should bring him the first one back again. At last, seeing there was no end to her begging, the boy said, ""Well! I will give you one if you uncover before me your other shoulder."" This the princess did instantly, and he noticed that she had the mark of a star on that arm also. In this way he lost a second lamb; and when the evening came he went home very sadly, feeling sure his mother would scold him. And so she did, far more than at the first time, calling him ill names and threatening to beat him. The boy was really sorry that he had given way to the princess's pleas, but he could not help it now. Next day, again, the princess came to him and begged so hard and so long for a third lamb that he became impatient, and, thinking to shame her, said he would give her one if she showed him her neck. To his great surprise, however, the king's daughter at once let her mantle fall, and he saw that she had the mark of a crescent on her throat. So the poor boy lost a third lamb, and hardly dared go home to his mother at night with the one lamb left them. Indeed the poor old woman was so angry at her son's carelessness in losing one lamb after another whilst he slept -- for he did not dare to tell her the truth about the princess -- that she cursed him as ""a good-for-nothing who would bring her to beggary."" Notwithstanding all his mother's reproaches and threats the boy could not refuse the princess the next day when she came out to ask for the fourth lamb. However, he tried to get her to go away a long time, and not until quite tired out with her begging, did he exclaim, ""Well, I will give you the lamb if you will show me your breast!"" Then the princess pushed her robe aside, and the boy noticed that she had the mark of a sun on her bosom. In this way the young shepherd lost all the four lambs, and he lived a long time with his mother in great poverty. A long, long time afterwards the king sent out a proclamation that he intended to let his daughter marry, and would give her to that man who could tell him what particular birthmarks she had about her. The young shepherd heard this proclamation, and when he went home in the evening he said to his mother, ""Mother, I intend to go to the king's palace tomorrow, so get me my best linen ready."" ""And what do you want in the king's palace?"" asked the poor old woman wondering. ""I intend, God helping me, to marry the king's daughter,"" replied the young man boldly. ""Oh! you had better give up that fancy,"" cried the mother. ""It will be better for you to go and work and gain a piaster than to go, like a fly without a head, dreaming about things that are as high as the sky above you."" But the young man would not be persuaded, and went the next day to the king's palace. Before going out of the hut, however, he said to his anxious old mother, ""Good-bye, mother."" He had not walked very far before a gipsy met him, and asked, ""Where are you going, my young man?"" ""I am going to the king's palace,"" answered the youth, ""and I mean, God helping me, to marry the king's daughter."" ""But, my dear comrade,"" said the gipsy, keeping near him, ""how can you really expect that she will marry you, when you are so poor? Only a shepherd!"" ""Eh!"" returned the young man; ""but I know what birthmarks she has, and the king has sent out a proclamation that whoever guesses these shall have her for his wife."" ""If it is so,"" rejoined the cunning gipsy, ""I myself will also go to the palace with you."" The young man was glad to have company on the road, and so he and the gipsy travelled on together until they came to the residence of the king. When they came to the palace they found a large number of people who had come to ""try their luck,"" and guess what birthmarks the princess had. But it was lost time, for every one of them, after going past the king and guessing ""by good luck"" at the marks of the princess, was obliged to go away, having lost his time and gained nothing. At length the turn came for the young shepherd to pass before the king, and the gipsy kept close to him to hear what he would say. So the youth stepped before the king and said, ""The princess has a star on each shoulder, and a crescent on the throat."" At this moment the gipsy shouted loudly, ""Look there! That is just what I was going to say!"" ""Be quiet!"" said the young shepherd; ""or, if you really know what other marks she has, speak out."" ""No, no!"" cried the gipsy, ""Go on, go on! When you have done, I will speak what I know!"" Then the youth turned again to the king and continued, ""The princess has the mark of a sun on her bosom."" ""That is exactly what I was going to say!"" cried the gipsy, coming up quickly; ""She has the mark of a sun on her breast."" Now the king was exceeding surprised, and confessed to his counsellors that the young shepherd had really guessed the truth. But as neither the king nor the counsellors at all liked the idea of the princess marrying a poor shepherd, they consulted how they could get rid of him without giving the lie to the king's proclamation. At length it was decided that his majesty should say, ""As both the shepherd and the gipsy have guessed the princess's birthmarks, I cannot justly decide which of them should marry her. But I will give to each of them seventy piasters, and they must both go and trade with this money for a year. At the end of the year, that one which brings back the most money shall have the princess for his wife."" The young shepherd and the gipsy, having received the money, went off in opposite directions to seek their fortunes. After having travelled about some time the shepherd stopped one night to rest in the hut of an old woman, who was even poorer than his own mother. As he sat with the old woman in the hut that evening, the lad thought he might just as well ask her advice as to the best way to invest his capital of seventy piasters, so he said, ""I have seventy piasters to trade with, can you tell me some good way in which I may employ them profitably?"" The old woman considered the matter for some time before she answered, and then said, ""Tomorrow is market day in the next city; go there yourself, and when a man brings a very poor cow for sale, go up and try to buy it. The cow will be of many different colors, but very thin and ill fed; but you must buy her at whatever price the man asks for her. When you have bought her, bring her here at once."" The young man agreed to follow the old woman's counsel, and so next day he went to the city and really found there a man who had brought a poor, but variously colored, cow to sell. Many people wished to buy the cow, but the young man outbid them all, and at length offered all his seventy piasters for her. So he got the cow, and drove it to the hut where he had passed the night. When the old woman came out to see who was coming, he called out to her, ""Now, my old mother, I have bought the cow, and what shall we do with her? She has cost me all my capital!"" The old woman answered at once, ""Kill the cow, my son, and cut it in pieces."" ""But how will that bring me back my money with profit?"" asked the young shepherd, hesitating whether he should follow her advice or no. ""Don't be afraid, my son, but do as I say,"" returned the old woman. Accordingly he did as she advised him, killed the cow and cut her into pieces. This done, he asked again, ""And now, what shall I do?"" The old woman said quietly, ""Well, now we will eat the meat, and the suet we will melt down and put into a pot to keep for some other occasion."" The shepherd did not at all like this proposal, for he could not see what return he could hope to get for such an investment of his capital. However, he thought within himself, ""Well, since I have been foolish enough to follow her counsel on the two former occasions, I may as well follow it also this third time."" So he remained with the old woman many days, until the last piece of meat had been eaten up. When, however, he thought over all that had happened, he grew very sad, and, seeing no sign of anything better, said one morning to the old woman reproachfully, ""Now you see by following your counsel I have spent all the king's money, and am now a ruined man!"" ""Don't be afraid, my son,"" said the old woman. ""You can now take that pot of suet with you and go to a certain country where all the people are suffering from a strange disease, and there you can sell for a good deal of money your suet, for it has the power to cure them."" The poor shepherd was very glad at hearing this, and next morning took the pot of suet on his shoulder and started on his journey. After he had travelled many, many days, he came to a strange-looking country, and, going a little farther, he discovered that the old woman had told the truth. All the citizens, from the poorest beggar to the king himself were suffering from a disease that no doctor had been able to cure. However, the shepherd's suet performed miracles, and in short order the sufferers were again all healthy and vigorous. The grateful king responded to the shepherd's miracle with the promise, ""Only ask! I will give you whatever you wish, even if it be my throne!"" ""I thank your Majesty very humbly for offering me your throne, but I don't want it,"" replied the shepherd; ""but if you will give me three ships full of gold and silver, and some good sailors to manage the ships, and some good soldiers and cannons to defend them against the pirates, I shall think myself more than repaid, and I will send you back the ships and cannons when the gold and silver are landed safely in my country."" Then the king at once gave the necessary orders, and in a very few days his servants came to report to him that the ships were then filled with gold and silver, and that the cannons were ready loaded and posted for action, and all the sailors and soldiers prepared to fight if any sea-robber came in their way. Then the young shepherd took a courteous leave of the king, and of all those other people who were so thankful to him for having cured them of their illness. He now went on board one of the ships, very glad to go back to his own country, and the two other ships full of gold and silver followed the first one across the seas. After having sailed a long time the three ships reached at last the coast of the kingdom where the king was waiting, daily expecting the return of the gipsy and shepherd to claim his daughter. The shepherd let his ships lie quietly in the harbor one day, and then, noticing much tumult and disturbance in the city, went ashore to see what had happened. There he found a great crowd, and on asking some of the people what they were going to do, they told him that they were going to hang a gipsy who had come to the city with seventy piasters capital, and who had not only spent all his money in drinking and reveling, but had even got into debt for seventy other piasters which he was quite unable to pay, and that this was the reason they were about to hang him. In a few moments the hangman appeared, leading the gipsy, who was no other than the very man who had tried to cheat the shepherd out of the princess. The young shepherd recognized his rival at once, and, going near him, said, ""What is this, my old friend? Have you really come to this?"" The instant the gipsy saw the shepherd he stopped and began to whine and wail, begging him to save him from the gibbet, and he would be his faithful servant all his life. ""As for the princess,"" he added cunningly, ""I have given her up a long time ago, and don't care for anything if only my life is spared."" Then the young shepherd was sorry for the poor trembling, whining wretch, and offered to pay the debt for the gipsy if the people would let him off. So they agreed to this, and the young man not only paid the seventy piasters the gipsy owed, but bought him besides a suit of good clothes as well as a carriage and a pair of fine horses. Then he left him and went back to his ships, and they sailed on slowly along the coast towards the king's residence. Now when the gipsy had dressed himself out smartly in his fine new clothes, he got into his carriage and drove off quickly to the king's palace. Arrived there, he left his carriage and horses in the courtyard, and went at once to the presence of the king, whom he addressed thus: ""Your majesty knows it is not yet quite a year since you gave me seventy piasters to trade with, and see! I come back already handsomely dressed, and have a fine carriage with a pair of beautiful horses below in the yard. As for the young shepherd, I have heard that he has not only spent all your majesty's money in rioting, but that he had also got in debt, for which he has been hung. So it is no use waiting for him! Let us keep my wedding at once!"" The king did not fancy the gipsy for his son-in-law, and was thinking what he could say to put him off a little time, when, looking by chance through his window, he saw three strange-looking ships sailing slowly towards the shore. At this he exclaimed, ""I see some foreign visitors are coming to visit me, and I shall have enough to do to receive them with due honors, so we must put off the marriage for some days, at least!"" But the gipsy pressed the king more and more to let him marry the princess at once; he was even bold enough to tell his Majesty that he could not wait any longer, and that the wedding would be all over in an hour. The king, however, refused to hear anything of this; so the gipsy, seeing that his plan had failed, went out from the presence of the king in great anger. A few hours later the three strange-looking ships dropped their anchors just opposite the palace, and the young shepherd, landing, came into the presence of the king, who was greatly astonished to see him alive, and still more astonished to hear that in return for his seventy piasters he had brought three vessels full of gold and silver. The king was now very well content to accept him as his son-in-law, and told him, in the course of conversation, what the gipsy had said about his having gone in debt and been hung. Then the young shepherd told his Majesty how he had found the gipsy, and had saved his life by paying his debt for him. The king was exceedingly angry, and ordered his servants to go after the gipsy and bring him at once into his presence. The servants looked about and around the palace on all sides, but nowhere could they find any trace of the gipsy. Then the king commanded that some of them should go in search of him without delay, and armed men were speedily scattered over the whole country, so that at last he was caught, and brought before the king, who condemned him to be hung for having so shamefully tried to injure the man who had saved his life and treated him so generously, and for having, at the same time, attempted to cheat the king. The young shepherd spent a few days in the palace, telling the king all the things he had seen abroad, and then, all preparations having been made, he was married to the princess, with great pomp and rejoicings. Then the king with his daughter and son-in-law lived for a great many years very happily.",Serbia,"Source (books.google.com): Serbian Folk-Lore, translated from the Serbian by Elodie L.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Swineherd,"Now, it certainly was rather bold of him to say to the emperor's daughter, ""Will you have me?"" He did, however, venture to say so, for his name was known far and wide; and there were hundreds of princesses who would have said ""Yes,"" and ""Thank you, kindly,"" but see if she would! Just let us hear about it. A rose tree grew on the grave of the prince's father, it was such a beautiful rose tree. It only bloomed every fifth year, and then only bore one blossom; but what a rose that was! By merely smelling it one forgot all one's cares and sorrows. He also had a nightingale which sang as if every lovely melody in the world dwelt in its little throat. This rose and this nightingale were to be given to the princess, so they were put into great silver caskets and sent to her. The emperor had them carried before him into the great hall where the princess was playing house with her ladies-in-waiting. They had nothing else to do. When she saw the caskets with the gifts she clapped her hands with delight! ""If only it were a little kitten!"" said she, -- but there was the lovely rose. ""Oh, how exquisitely it is made!"" said all the ladies-in-waiting. ""It is more than beautiful,"" said the emperor. ""It is nice."" But the princess touched it, and then she was ready to cry. ""Fie, papa!"" she said. ""It is not artificial. It is a real one!"" ""Fie!"" said all the ladies-in-waiting. ""It is a real one!"" ""Well, let us see what there is in the other casket, before we get angry,"" said the emperor, and out came the nightingale. It sang so beautifully that at first no one could find anything to say against it. ""Superbe! Charmant!"" said the ladies-in-waiting, for they all spoke French, each one worse than the others. ""How that bird reminds me of our late empress's musical box,"" said an old courtier. "" Ah, yes, they are the same tunes, and the same beautiful performance."" ""So they are,"" said the emperor, and he cried like a little child. ""I should hardly think it could be a real one,"" said the princess. ""Yes, it is a real one,"" said those who had brought it. ""Oh, let that bird fly away then,"" said the princess, and she would not hear of allowing the prince to come. But the prince was not to be crushed. He stained his face brown and black, and, pressing his cap over his eyes, he knocked at the door. ""Good morning, emperor,"" said he; ""can I be taken into service in the palace?"" ""Well, there are so many wishing to do that,"" said the emperor; ""but let me see! -- Yes, I need somebody to look after the pigs, for we have so many of them."" So the prince was made imperial swineherd. A horrid little room was given him near the pig-sties, and here he had to live. He sat busily at work all day, and by the evening he had made a beautiful little cooking pot. It had bells all round it and when the pot boiled they tinkled delightfully and played the old tune: But the greatest charm of all about it was, that by holding one's finger in the steam one could immediately smell all the dinners that were being cooked at every stove in the town. Now this was a very different matter from a rose. The princess came walking along with all her ladies-in-waiting, and when she heard the tune she stopped and looked pleased, for she herself could play its melody on the piano, but only with one finger. ""Why, that is my song,"" she said. ""This must be a cultivated swineherd. Go and ask him what the instrument costs."" So one of the ladies-in-waiting had to go into his room, but she put clogs on first. ""How much do you want for the pot,"" she asked. ""I must have ten kisses from the princess,"" said the swineherd. ""Heaven preserve us!"" said the lady. ""I won't take less,"" said the swineherd. ""Well, what does he say?"" asked the princess. ""I really cannot tell you,"" said the lady-in-waiting. ""It is so shocking."" ""Then you must whisper it."" And she whispered it. ""He is a wretch!"" said the princess, and went away at once. But she had only gone a little way when she heard the bells tinkling beautifully: ""Go and ask him if he will take ten kisses from the ladies-in-waiting."" ""No, thank you,"" said the swineherd. ""Ten kisses from the princess, or I keep my pot."" ""How tiresome it is,"" said the princess. ""Then you will have to stand round me, so that no one may see."" So the ladies-in-waiting stood round her and spread out their skirts while the swineherd took his ten kisses, and then the pot was hers. What a delight it was to them. The pot was kept on the boil day and night. They knew what was cooking on every stove in the town, from the chamberlain's to the shoemaker's. The ladies-in-waiting danced about and clapped their hands. ""We know who has sweet soup and pancakes for dinner, and who has cutlets. How amusing it is."" ""Highly interesting,"" said the mistress of the robes. ""Yes, but hold your tongues, for I am the emperor's daughter."" ""Heaven preserve us!"" they all said. The swineherd -- that is to say, the prince, only nobody knew that he was not a real swineherd -- did not let the day pass in idleness, and he now constructed a rattle. When it was swung round it played all the waltzes, gallops and jig tunes which have ever been heard since the creation of the world. ""But this is superbe!"" said the princess, as she walked by. ""I have never heard finer compositions. Go and ask him what the instrument costs, but let us have no more kissing."" ""He wants a hundred kisses from the princess!"" said the lady-in-waiting. ""I think he is mad!"" said the princess, and she went away, but she had not gone far when she stopped. ""One must encourage art,"" she said; ""I am the emperor's daughter. Tell him he can have ten kisses, the same as yesterday, and he can take the others from the ladies-in-waiting."" ""But we don't like that at all,"" said the ladies. ""Oh, nonsense! If I can kiss him you can do the same. Remember that I pay your wages as well as give you board and lodging."" So the lady-in-waiting had to go again. ""A hundred kisses from the princess, or let each keep his own."" ""Stand in front of me,"" said she, and all the ladies stood round, while he kissed her. ""Whatever is the meaning of that crowd round the pig-sties?"" said the emperor as he stepped out onto the balcony; he rubbed his eyes and put on his spectacles. ""Why it is the ladies-in-waiting, what game are they up to? I must go and see!"" So he pulled up the heels of his slippers for they were shoes which he had trodden down. Bless us, what a hurry he was in! When he got into the yard, he walked very softly and the ladies were so busy counting the kisses, so that there should be fair play, and neither too few nor too many kisses, that they never heard the emperor. He stood on tiptoe. ""What is all this?"" he said when he saw what was going on, and he hit them on the head with his slipper just as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss. ""Out you go!"" said the emperor, for he was furious, and both the princess and the prince were put out of his realm. There she stood crying, and the swineherd scolded, and the rain poured down in torrents. ""Oh, miserable creature that I am! If only I had accepted the handsome prince. Oh, how unhappy I am!"" The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped the black and brown stain from his face, and threw away his ugly clothes. Then he stepped out dressed as a prince. He was so handsome that the princess could not help curtseying to him. ""I am come to despise you,"" he said. ""You would not have an honorable prince, you could not prize the rose or the nightingale, but you would kiss the swineherd for a trumpery musical box! As you have made your bed, so must you lie upon it!"" Then he went back into his own little kingdom and shut and locked, the door. So she had to stand outside and sing in earnest:",Hans Christian Andersen,"Source (books.google.com): Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen, third edition (London: J. M.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Swineherd Who Married a Princess,"One warm summer's day the princess was out walking in the shady woods, and she came upon the swineherd, just as his pig had finished dancing a jig. ""Oh, please make him dance once again,"" asked the princess, ever so courteously, for she had never before seen a pig dance. ""Only if you will lift your skirts to your knees,"" answered the swineherd. The princess could see no harm in this, so she lifted her skirts to her knees, and sure enough, the swineherd's pig danced a merry jig. ""That was too short,"" said the princess. ""Can't he dance some more?"" ""Only if you lift your skirts to your waist,"" said the swineherd. The princess hesitated, but again she could see no harm in his request, so she lifted her skirts to her waist, and the pig danced another merry jig. She still had not had enough and asked, again ever so politely, if the pig couldn't dance just one more time. It was such a cheerful thing to see! ""Only if you lift your skirts to your neck,"" said the swineherd. ""To my neck?"" she asked. ""To your neck!"" he replied. Now not even a princess can see a dancing pig every day, so she lifted her skirts to her neck, and the swineherd's pig danced his very best. Some time later the king decided that it was time for the princess to marry, and because she was the most beautiful maiden in all the land, suitors came from near and far. The king could not choose from the many princes and noblemen who came courting his daughter. Finally he decreed that to win the princess's hand in marriage a suitor would have to describe her secret birthmark. You see, from the day the princess was born she had had a birthmark on her belly, a dainty little spot from which grew three fine golden hairs. The swineherd soon learned of the proclamation, and went to the castle at once, because, of course, he had seen the mark with the three golden hairs on the day that the princess had lifted her skirts in order to make his pig dance. Now a king's word is a king's word, and even though he did not relish giving his daughter to a simple swineherd, he had to do as he had promised. After all, the swineherd was able to describe the birthmark ever so correctly, down to the last golden hair. But the story is not yet done, for one of the princes who had come to court the princess offered the princess's lady-in-waiting a bag of gold if she would just describe to him her mistress's birthmark. The faithless servant took the gold and told the unworthy prince what he wanted to know. When the deceitful prince presented himself to the king and described the princess's birthmark ever so accurately, the king, at first, did not know what to do. But then he struck upon a plan. ""Let the princess decide herself!"" he proclaimed. She and the two suitors shall spend the night together in the princess's bed. At sunrise I will look in on them, and the one she is facing shall be her husband. When the swineherd learned of the king's decree, he made plans for the night. First he put a large clump of chocolate (some say that it was marzipan) into his pocket. Then he secretly dropped an herb into the false prince's evening soup, an herb that would summon nature's call quickly and surely. That night the swineherd, the deceitful prince, and the beautiful princess all lay down in her large bed; the king locked the door behind them; and they closed their eyes. Then suddenly the false prince jumped up with a start and ran to the door, but it was locked. ""I have to also!"" said the swineherd, jumping out of bed. ""What can we do? We're locked in!"" cried the prince. ""We'll have to do it on the floor."" said the swineherd. Then each man deposited something on the floor: the swineherd his clump of chocolate, and the prince --, well, some things are better left unsaid. ""Now we are in trouble!"" said the swineherd. ""When the king discovers what we've done, he'll have us killed!"" ""What can we do?"" asked the terrified prince. ""We've no choice,"" answered the swineherd. ""We'll have to eat it."" Thus the swineherd ate his clump of chocolate, and the false prince ate ----, well, again, some things are better left unsaid. They returned to the sleeping princess's bed, one on one side of her and one on the other. With time the princess turned toward the prince and breathed in deeply, but then she gasped and quickly turned the other way. At sunrise the king looked in on them and found the princess contentedly asleep with her face nearly touching that of the swineherd. And that is how a simple swineherd came to marry a princess.",Europe,NA,The Princess's Birthmarks (Denmark). Retold from various European sources.,NA
The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,The Youngest Prince and the Youngest Princess,"There was once a king who had seven sons and seven daughters. He was in great trouble where to find princesses of royal blood as wives for his sons and princes as husbands for his daughters. At last the idea struck him that the seven sons should marry the seven daughters. They all consented to their father's wish with the exception of the youngest son and daughter. ""Well, if you won't,"" said the father, ""I will give you your inheritance and you can go and try your fortune, and get married as best you can."" The two children went, and came to a strange land, where they were overtaken by darkness in a wood. They chose a bushy tree for their resting place, whose leafy boughs bent down to the ground and afforded shelter. When they woke next morning, the girl told her brother that she had dreamt that there was a town not far off, where a king lived who had been ill for a long time, and thousands upon thousands of doctors had failed to cure him. He again dreamt that an old man with snow-white hair told him that the tree under which they slept gave water. In this water the king was to be bathed, and he would be cured. They at once examined the tree, and from a crack in the bark sap as clear as crystal was dripping; they filled their flasks with the fluid and continued their journey. When they reached the outskirts of the forest, they saw a town in front of them. Having arrived there they went into an inn to find out whether their dream was true, and asked the host what the news was in the town; he, in his conversation, mentioned the illness of the king, and the many unsuccessful attempts of men to cure him, and that he had strict orders, under a heavy penalty, to report at once every doctor that came to his inn. ""I also am a doctor,"" said the prince, ""and this youth is my assistant,"" he continued, pointing to his sister, who was dressed in male attire. The innkeeper at once reported them, and they went to court to try their remedy on the king. The king's body was covered with sores, and the doctor bathed his hand with the juice of the tree. To his great joy, the king discovered next morning that the place which had been bathed was visibly improving; he therefore, the very same night, sent a huge wooden vessel on a cart to the tree, to bring him sufficient water for a bath. After a few baths the king actually recovered; and the doctor, having received a handsome present, requested a favor of the king, viz., to pay him a visit and to do him the honor of dining with him. The king cordially granted the request, and the prince received him with great splendor in his spacious apartments, which were decorated with a lavishness becoming a sovereign. As the king found the doctor alone, he inquired after his assistant, and at this moment a charming pretty girl stepped from one of the side rooms, whom the king at once recognized as the doctor's assistant. The strangers now related to him their story, and the king became more affable, especially towards the pretty assistant, who at once gained possession of his heart and soul, and the short acquaintance ended with a wedding. The prince, not forgetting the object of his journey, started soon after the wedding festivities were over. He passed on till he came to the boundary of the king's realm, and then went on as far as the capital of the next country. He was riding about the streets on a fine horse, when he heard a voice coming from a window close by, ""Hum, you, too, won't get on without me,"" and looking in the direction from which the voice came, he discovered an old man looking out of the window. He didn't take any notice of the voice, but went on; and, having arrived at an inn, made sundry inquiries, when he was told that adventurous young men in this town might either meet with great fortune or with a great misfortune; because the king had a daughter whom no one had as yet seen, with the exception of her old nurse. The girl had three marks on her, and whoever found out what they were, and where they were, would become her husband; but whosoever undertook the task and failed, would be impaled, and that already ninety-nine young fellows had died in this manner. Upon hearing this, it became clear to the prince what the meaning of the old man's saying was; he thought, that no doubt the old man took him for another adventurer, and the thought struck him that the old man must be acquainted with the secret, and that it would be advantageous to make his acquaintance. He found a plea at once; the old man was a goldsmith, and, as the prince had lost the rowel of his golden spur on the road, he called on him, and, having come to terms about the spur, the prince inquired of him about the princess, and the old man's tale tallied with that of the innkeeper. After a short reflection, the prince told the old man who he was, and, with a look full of meaning, inquired if the goldsmith could help him in case he tried his luck. ""For a good sum with pleasure,"" replied the goldsmith. ""You shall have it,"" said the prince; ""but tell me how, and I will give you this purse on account."" The old man, seeing that there was good opportunity for gain, said, ""I will construct a silver horse in which you can conceal yourself, and I will expose it for sale in the market. I am almost sure that no one will buy it but someone attached to the royal court, and if once you get in there, you can get out of the horse by a secret opening and go back whenever you like and, I think, you will succeed."" And so it happened; on the following market day a splendid silver horse was exhibited in the vicinity of the royal palace. There were a good many admirers, but on account of the great price there was no buyer, till at last a person belonging to the royal court enquired the price; after a few moments he returned and bought the horse for the king, who presented it to his daughter, and thus the prince managed to get into the chamber of the princess, which was the most difficult of all things, and he listened amidst fear and joy to the silvery voice of the pretty girl, who amused herself with the horse -- which ran on wheels -- and called it her dear pet. Evening drew on, and the mysterious girl went to rest; everything became quiet, and only her old nurse was sitting up not far from her bed; but about midnight she, too, fell asleep. Hearing that she was fast asleep, the prince got out of the horse and approached the girl's bed, holding his breath, and found the mark of the sun shining on the girl's forehead, the moon on the right breast, and three stars on the left. Having found out the three secret marks, the prince was about to retire to his hiding place when the princess woke. She tried to scream, but at an imploring gesture of the youth she kept silence. The girl could not take her eyes off the handsome prince, who related to her how and for what reason he had dared to come. The girl, being tired of her long seclusion, consented to his scheme, and they secretly plotted how the prince should get out of the palace; whereupon he went back to his hiding place. In accord with the plot, next morning the girl broke one of the horse's ears off, and it was sent back to the goldsmith's to be repaired, and the prince was thus able to leave his dangerous position. Having again splendidly remunerated the goldsmith, he returned to his new brother-in-law, so that he might come back with a splendid suite and royal pomp, and appear as a king to try his fortune. The prince returned with many magnificently clad knights and splendid horses, and reported himself to the king, and informed him by message that he was anxious to try his luck for the possession of his daughter. The king was very much pleased with the appearance of the youth, and therefore kindly admonished him not to risk his life, but the prince seemed quite confident, and insisted on carrying out his wishes; so a day was fixed for carrying out the task. The people streamed out to the place where the trial was to take place, like as to a huge festival. And all pitied the handsome youth, and had sad misgivings as to his fate. The king granted three days to those who tried their fortune, and three guesses. On the first and second day, in order not to betray the plot, and in order to increase the éclat the prince guessed wrongly on purpose; but on the third day, when everyone was convinced that he must die, he disclosed in a loud voice the secret marks of the princess. The king declared them to be right, and the prince was led to his future wife, amidst the cheers of the multitude and the joyous strains of the band. The king ordered immense wedding festivities all over the town, and resigned his throne in favor of his son-in-law, who reigned happy for many years after!",Hungary,"Source (books.google.com): Henry Jones and Lewis L.

The Birthmarks of the Princess,0850,Three Golden Hairs,"One day a ragman came to him with a wooden flute. The one sow had six piglets, and the ragman said, ""I will trade this wooden flute to you for three of your six piglets. If you blow on the flute your piglets will dance to the tune."" The boy did not want to do this, fearing that his master, the peasant, would scold him and beat him. To that the ragman said, ""You can tell your master that you'll give up your wages for the piglets. It is possible that you'll gain much more with the flute than your lost wages."" When the boy returned home with the pigs the peasant asked him, ""Where are the three piglets?"" ""I traded them to the ragman for this flute. He said that the piglets will dance if I play the flute."" The peasant was about to beat the boy, but the latter told him to take the value of the missing piglets from his wages. Early the next morning the boy let the sow and the three piglets out into the farmyard and began to blow on the flute. To the amazement of the peasant the piglets danced. Never in his lifetime had he heard of piglets that could dance. He was now satisfied with the situation. From then on the boy tended sows and piglets in the pasture, playing a little piece on the flute, to which the piglets danced. The people who came by saw the dancing piglets, and they became famous in the entire village and also in other villages as well. Now it happened that a young lady in the village heard about the dancing piglets. Early one morning she went out to the boy and asked to buy one of the piglets. The boy was not allowed to sell one without asking his master. The peasant said, ""You can sell them if you get a good price."" Happily the boy went back out to the pasture. ""The young lady asked, ""What will you take for one of the piglets?"" ""One hundred thalers, and then you'll have to lift your skirts up to your knees."" At first she did not want to do this, but finally she did lift her skirts up to her knees. ""This boy knows a lot,"" she thought. Then the young lady took her piglet home with her and put it in the stall. The pig-girl was to keep watch over it and report when it began to dance. A whole day passed, but the piglet did not dance. The young lady thought, ""If I had two of them, then they would dance for sure."" So she went to the boy and asked how much a second piglet would cost. ""Two hundred thalers, and lift your skirts up to your waist."" She did not want to do this, but the boy said, ""I'll not sell the piglet for any other price."" She thought, ""This boy knows how to shame a girl,"" but she did what he asked, then gave him two hundred thalers, and took the piglet home with her. She thought that the two piglets would dance, but they did not. On the third day she went once again to the boy and said that it was not true, that the piglets could dance; but the boy said that they could indeed. So then she thought that if she had all three they would dance, and she asked how much the boy wanted for the third piglet. He said, ""Three hundred thalers, and lift your skirt above your navel."" She did not want to do this, and thought about it for a long time, but finally she gave in. Now the young lady had an unusual mark: three golden hairs above her navel. When she returned home and had all three piglets together, she thought that they would dance. But they did not dance. So she sent a messenger to the boy, complaining that he had cheated her. The boy insisted, however, that they had danced for him. Then the peasant said, ""Send the wooden flute to the young lady. We received a good price for the piglets."" So the boy gave the flute to the messenger, and asked him to tell the young lady to play a while on it, and then the piglets would dance for sure. When the young lady blew on the flute the pigs danced, and she was very happy, for no one else had pigs like these. And she sent a generous tip to the boy. Some months later the young lady announced that she wanted to marry. She would give a feast and invite all the young gentlemen. She proclaimed that she would marry the one who could guess what her unusual mark was. On the appointed day all the suitors sat around the table eating and drinking. The boy had heard about this, and he sneaked into a corner. Beforehand he supplied himself with some peppermint drops, thinking that no one would offer him anything to eat. After dinner the guessing began, but no one could identify the young lady's mark. A half-hour pause was declared to give everyone time to think. They continued with the guessing, but no one was right. And after a third round of guessing, still no one succeeded. Finally the boy shouted out, ""I know what the young lady's mark is!"" ""Out with it! What is it?"" said everyone. ""She has three golden hairs above her navel."" Then they asked the young lady if this was true. She had to admit that it was so, but she did not want to marry the boy instead of one of the young gentlemen. Then they had to decide how to settle the dispute. One said one thing; another said something else, and finally they decided to -------- Now I am not allowed to say what happened next, but in the end the boy did indeed get the young lady, and he became her gentleman.",Wendish,"Source (books.google.com): Wilibald von Schulenburg, ""Die drei goldenen Haare,"" Wendische Volkssagen und Gebräuche aus dem Spreewald (Leipzig: F.

The Black School,3000,Black Airt,"""Black Airt"" was firmly believed in [in the north-east of Scotland]. If the proficients in this science did not make a compact with Satan, they were very much in communion with him. He was regarded as the fountain from which it sprang. It was looked upon as a kind of wisdom by which men came to be able to know the hidden essence of things, the virtues of herbs for cure or poison, to have power over nature in many of her workings, power to cure disease, to guard against witches and fairies, to remove their spells, to discover thieves, and even to see into the future. Under the teaching they got, some of the students reached a high degree of expertness, and became a match for the devil himself in cunning, and were even able to outwit him. Spain and Italy, particularly Italy, were the countries in which the science was most flourishing, and in which it was taught most efficiently, and thither all, who wished to become adepts in it, went. Its study was carried on in dark rooms under famous teachers; and, on leaving the classrooms, the students had to pass through a long black passage at the end of which stood the prince of darkness watching to catch the last one. No sooner had the last word of the professor's lecture been spoken than out rushed the students, and made for the light pell-mell through the black passage shouting, ""Deel tack the hinmost!"" The devil, on one occasion, clutched at a student. He met one who was more than a match for him. The student called out, ""There is another behind me!"" His sable majesty looked first to this side, and then to that. He saw what seemed a man. He rushed upon it and seized it. It was the student's shadow. Ever after the student was shadowless.",Scotland,"Source: Walter Gregor, Notes on the Folk-Lore of the North-East of Scotland (London: Folk-Lore Society, 1881), p. 73.",NA,NA
The Black School,3000,The Black School,"Once upon a time there existed somewhere in the world, nobody knows where, a school which was called the Black School. There the pupils learned witchcraft and all sorts of ancient arts. Wherever this school was, it was somewhere below ground, and was held in a strong room which, as it had no window, was eternally dark and changeless. There was no teacher either, but everything was learnt from books with fiery letters, which could be read quite easily in the dark. Never were the pupils allowed to go out into the open air or see the daylight during the whole time they stayed there, which was from five to seven years. By then they had gained a thorough and perfect knowledge of the sciences to be learnt. A shaggy gray hand came through the wall every day with the pupils' meals, and when they had finished eating and drinking took back the horns and platters. But one of the rules of the school was, that the owner should keep for himself that one of the students who should leave the school the last every year. And, considering that it was pretty well known among the pupils that the devil himself was the master, you may fancy what a scramble there was at each year's end, everybody doing his best to avoid being last to leave the school. It happened once that three Icelanders went to this school, by the name of Sæmundur the Learned, Kálfur Arnason, and Hálfdán Eldjárnsson; and as they all arrived at the same time, they were all supposed to leave at the same time. Sæmundur declared himself willing to be the last of them, at which the others were much lightened in mind. So he threw over himself a large mantle, leaving the sleeves loose and the fastenings free. A staircase led from the school to the upper world, and when Sæmundur was about to mount this the devil grasped at him and said, ""You are mine!"" But Sæmundur slipped out of this mantle and made off with all speed, leaving the devil the empty cloak. However, just as he left the school the heavy iron door was slammed suddenly to, and wounded Sæmundur on the heels. Then he said, ""That was pretty close upon my heels,"" which words have since passed into a proverb. The Sæmundur contrived to escape from the Black School, with his companions, scot-free. Some people relate, that, when Sæmundur came into the doorway, the sun shone upon him and threw his shadow onto the opposite wall. And as the devil stretched out his hand to grapple with him, Sæmundur said, ""I am not the last. Do you not see who follows me?"" So the devil seized the shadow, mistaking it for a man, and Sæmundur escaped with a blow on his heels from the iron door. But from that hour he was always shadowless, for whatever the devil took, he never gave back again.",Iceland,"Source: Jón Árnason, Icelandic Legends, translated by George E. J. Powell and Eiríkur Magnússon (London: Richard Bentley, 1864), pp. 226-28.","Sæmundur the Learned (1054-1133) was Iceland's first great scholar.

The Blind Men and the Elephant,1317,All Faiths Lead to God: Four Blind Men and an Elephant,"One who touched its leg said, ""The elephant is like a pillar."" The second who touched the trunk said, ""The elephant is like a thick club."" The third touched the belly, and thought it to be like a big jar. The fourth who felt the ears, concluded that the elephant was like a winnowing fan. They then began to dispute amongst themselves as to the ?gure of the animal they had touched. A passer-by hearing them quarrel, said, ""What is it this you are disputing about?"" Then they stated the question and asked him to arbitrate. He said, ""Not one of you knows the real elephant. As a whole, it is neither like a pillar, nor a jar, nor a winnowing fan, nor a club. But its legs are like pillars, its belly like a big jar, its ears like a winnowing fan, and its trunk like a thick club. The elephant itself is a combination of all these."" In exactly the same manner do men quarrel among themselves about religion, each having seen some different aspect of the Deity.",Ramakrishna,"Source: Sri Ramakrishna's Teachings, part 1, first edition (Lohaghat P.

The Blind Men and the Elephant,1317,On the Blind Men and the Affair of the Elephant,"A desire arose among the people to see this monstrous elephant, and a number of the blind, like fools, visited it, every one running in his haste to find out its shape and form. They came, and being without the sight of their eyes groped about it with their hands; each of them by touching one member obtained a notion of some one part; each one got a conception of an impossible object, and fully believed his fancy true. When they returned to the people of the city, the others gathered round them, all expectant, so misguided and deluded were they. They asked about the appearance and shape of the elephant, and what they told all listened to. One asked him whose hand had come upon its ear about the elephant; he said, ""It is a huge and formidable object, broad and rough and spreading, like a carpet."" And he whose hand had come upon its trunk said, ""I have found out about it; it is straight and hollow in the middle like a pipe, a terrible thing and an instrument of destruction."" And he who had felt the thick hard legs of the elephant said, ""As I have it in mind, its form is straight like a planed pillar."" Every one had seen some one of its parts, and all had seen it wrongly. No mind knew the whole. Knowledge is never the companion of the blind. All, like fools deceived, fancied absurdities. Men know not the Divine essence; into this subject the philosophers may not enter.","Sanai, The Enclosed Garden of the Truth","Source: Sanai, The first book of the Hadiqatu'l-Haqiqat; or, The Enclosed Garden of the Truth of the Hakim Abu'l-Majd Majdud Sana'i of Ghazna, edited and translated by J.

The Blind Men and the Elephant,1317,The Blind Men and the Elephant,"On a certain occasion, the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of Anathapindika. Now at that time a large number of Samanas, Brahmanas and wandering monks of various heretical sects, holding a variety of views, doubters on many points, having many diverse aspirations, and recourse to that which relates to various heresies, entered Savatthi for alms. Some of these Samanas and Brahmanas held that the world is eternal and contended that this view was true and every other false. Some said: ""The world is not eternal."" Some said: ""The world is finite."" Some said: ""The world is infinite."" Some said: ""The soul and the body are identical."" Some said: ""The soul and the body are not identical."" Some said: ""The Perfect One continues to exist after death."" Some said: ""The Perfect One does not continue to exist after death."" Some said: ""The Perfect One exists and does not exist after death."" Some said: ""The Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after death."" Each contending their view was true and every other false. These quarrelsome, pugnacious, cavilling monks wounded one another with sharp words (lit. mouth-javelins) declaiming: ""Such is the truth, such is not the truth: the truth is not such, such is the truth."" And a number of Bhikkhus [monks], robing themselves in the forenoon and taking their alms-bowls and tunics, entered Savatthi for alms and when they had returned from their rounds and finished their meal, they went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near, they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and while thus sitting they said to the Blessed One: ""Just now, Sire, a large number of Samanas and Brahmanas and wandering monks holding various heresies entered Savatthi for alms, and they are disputing among themselves, saying: 'This is the truth, such is not the truth etc. [as above. Transl.]'"" ""These heretical monks, O Bhikkhus, are blind, eyeless, they know not what is right, they know not what is wrong, they know not what is true, they know not what is false. These monks not perceiving what is right, not perceiving what is wrong, not perceiving what is true, not perceiving what is false, become disputatious, saying: 'such is the truth, such is not the truth etc. [as above. Transl.]'"" ""Be it so, Lord'' said that man in assent to the King and he went to Savatthi and he brought all the men born blind in Savatthi to where the King was and drawing near he said to the King: ""Lord, all the men blind from their birth in Savatthi are present."" ""Pray, then, bring an elephant before them."" ""Be it so, Lord"" said that man in assent to the King and he brought an elephant into the presence of the blind men and said: ""This, O blind men, is an elephant."" To some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant, saying, ""Such, O blind men, is an elephant."" To some he presented the body, saying: ""such is an elephant."" To some he presented the feet, saying: ""Such is an elephant."" To some he presented the back, saying: ""Such is an elephant."" To some he presented the tail, saying : ""Such is an elephant."" To some he presented the hairy tuft of the tail, saying: 'Such is an elephant.' The show-man, O Bhikkhus, having presented the elephant to these blind ones, went to where the King was and drawing near said to the King: ""The elephant, Lord, has been brought before the blind men, do now as seems fit."" And the King went to where the blind men were, and drawing near said to them: ""Do you now know what an elephant is like?"" ""Assuredly, Lord; we now know what an elephant is like."" ""Tell me then, O blind men, what an elephant is like."" And those blind men, O Bhikkhus, who had felt the head of the elephant, said: ""An elephant, Sir, is like a large round jar. Those who had felt its ears, said: ""It is like a winnowing basket."" Those who had felt its tusks, said: ""It is like a plough-share."" Those who had felt its trunk, said: ""It is like a plough."" Those who had felt its body, said: ""It is like a granary."" Those who had felt its feet, said: ""It is like a pillar."" Those who had felt its back, said: ""It is like a mortar."" Those who had felt its tail, said: ""It is a like a pestle."" Those who had felt the tuft of its tail, said: ""It is like a broom."" And they all fought amongst themselves with their fists, declaring, ""Such is an elephant, such is not elephant, an elephant is not like that, it is like this."" In exactly the same way, O Bhikkhus, do these heretical people, blind and without insight, dispute among themselves saying ""This doctrine is true, every other is false."" And the Blessed One in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:",The Udāna,"Source: The Udāna; or, The Solemn Utterrances of the Buddha, translated from the Pali by D.

The Blue Light,0562,"Lars, My Lad!","So late one evening he came to a great forest. He did not know where he should find a shelter for the night, but he went on looking and searching till he caught sight of an old tumble-down hut, which stood in the middle of some bushes. It was not exactly good enough for such a fine cavalier, but when you cannot get what you want you must take what you can get. And, since there was no help for it, he went into the hut. Not a living soul was to be seen; there was not even a stool to sit upon, but alongside the wall stood a big chest. What could there be inside that chest? If only there were some bits of moldy bread in it! How nice they would taste! For, you must know, he had not had a single bit of food the whole day, and he was so hungry and his stomach so empty that it groaned with pain. He lifted the lid. but inside the chest there was another chest, and inside that chest there was another; and so it went on, each one smaller than the other, until they became quite tiny boxes. The more there were the harder he worked away, for there must be something very fine inside, he thought, since it was so well hidden. At last he came to a tiny, little box, and in this box lay a bit of paper -- and that was all he got for his trouble! It was very annoying, of course, but then he discovered there was something written on the paper, and when he looked at it he was just able to spell it out, although at first it looked somewhat difficult. ""Lars, my lad!"" As he pronounced these words something answered right in his ear, ""What are master's orders?"" He looked round, but he saw nobody. This was very funny, he thought, and so he read out the words once more, ""Lars, my lad!"" And the answer came as before, ""What are master's orders?"" But he did not see anybody this time either. ""If there is anybody about who hears what I say, then be kind enough to bring me something to eat,"" he said. And the next moment there stood a table laid out with all the best things one could think of. He set to work to eat and drink, and had a proper fill. He had never enjoyed himself so much in all his life, he thought. When he had eaten all he could get down, he began to feel sleepy, and so he took out the paper again, ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""Well, you have given me food and drink, and now you must get me a bed to sleep in as well. But I want a really fine bed,"" he said, for you must know he was a little more bold now that his hunger was stayed. Well, there it stood, a bed so fine and dainty that even the king himself might covet it. Now this was all very well in its way, but when once you are well off you wish for still more, and he had no sooner got into bed than he began to think that the room was altogether too wretched for such a grand bed. So he took out the paper again: ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""Since you are able to get me such food and such a bed here in the midst of the wild forest, I suppose you can manage to get me a better room, for you see I am accustomed to sleep in a palace, with golden mirrors and draped walls and ornaments and comforts of all kinds,"" he said. Well, he had no sooner spoken the words than he found himself lying in the grandest chamber anybody had ever seen. Now he was comfortable, he thought, and felt quite satisfied as he turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes. But that was not all the grandeur; for when he woke up in the morning and looked round, he saw it was a big palace he had been sleeping in. One room led into the other, and wherever he went the place was full of all sorts of finery and luxuries, both on the walls and on the ceilings, and they glittered so much when the sun shone on them that he had to shade his eyes with his hand, so strong was the glare of gold and silver wherever he turned. He then happened to look out of the window. Good gracious! How grand it was! There was something else than pine forests and juniper bushes to look at, for there was the finest garden anyone could wish for, with splendid trees and roses of all kinds. But he could not see a single human being, or even a cat; and that, you know, was rather lonely, for otherwise he had everything so grand and had been set up as his own master again. So he took out the bit of paper: ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""Well, now you have given me food and bed and a palace to live in, I intend to remain here, for I like the place,"" he said, ""yet I don't like to live quite by myself. I must have both lads and lasses whom I may order about to wait on me,"" he said. And there they were. There came servants and stewards and scullery maids and chambermaids of all sorts, and some came bowing and some curtseying. So now the duke thought he was really satisfied. But now it happened that there was a large palace on the other side of the forest, and there the king lived who owned the forest, and the great, big fields around it. As he was walking up and down in his room he happened to look out through the window and saw the new palace, where the golden weathercocks were swinging to and fro on the roof in the sunlight, dazzling his eyes. ""This is very strange,"" he thought; and so he called his courtiers. They came rushing in, and began bowing and scraping. ""Do you see the palace over there?"" said the king. They opened their eyes and began to stare. Yes, of course, they saw it. ""Who is it that has dared to build such a palace on my grounds?"" said the king. They bowed, and they scraped with their feet, but they did not know anything about it. The king then called his generals and captains. They came, stood at attention and presented arms. ""Be gone, soldiers and troopers,"" said the king, ""and pull down the palace over there, and hang him who has built it; and don't lose any time about it!"" Well, they set off in great haste to arm themselves, and away they went. The drummers beat the skins of their drums, and the trumpeters blew their trumpets, and the other musicians played and blew as best they could, so that the duke heard them long before he could see them. But he had heard this kind of noise before, and knew what it meant, so he took out his scrap of paper: ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""There are soldiers coming here,"" he said, ""and now you must provide me with soldiers and horses, that I may have double as many as those over in the wood, and with sabers and pistols, and guns and cannons with all that belongs to them; but be quick about it."" And no time was lost; for when the duke looked out, he saw an immense number of soldiers, who were drawn up around the palace. When the king's men arrived, they came to a sudden halt and dared not advance. But the duke was not afraid; he went straight up to the colonel of the king's soldiers and asked him what he wanted. The colonel told him his errand. ""It's of no use,"" said the duke. ""You see how many men I have; and if the king will listen to me, we shall become good friends, and I will help him against his enemies, and in such a way that it will be heard of far and wide,"" he said. The colonel was of the same opinion, and the duke then invited him and all his soldiers inside the palace, and the men had more than one glass to drink and plenty of everything to eat as well. But while they were eating and drinking they began talking; and the duke then got to hear that the king had a daughter who was his only child, and was so wonderfully fair and beautiful that no one had ever seen her like before. And the more the king's soldiers ate and drank the more they thought she would suit the duke for a wife. And they went on talking so long that the duke at last began to be of the same opinion. ""The worst of it,"" said the soldiers, ""is that she is just as proud as she is beautiful, and will never look at a man."" But the duke laughed at this. ""If that's all,"" said the duke, ""there's sure to be a remedy for that complaint."" When the soldiers had eaten and drunk as much as they could find room for, they shouted ""Hurrah!"" so that it echoed among the hills, and then they set out homeward. But, as you may imagine, they did not walk exactly in parade order, for they were rather unsteady about the knees, and many of them did not carry their guns in regulation manner. The duke asked them to greet the king from him. He would call on him the following day, he said. When the duke was alone again, he began to think of the princess, and to wonder if she were as beautiful and fair as they had made her out to be. He would like to make sure of it; and as so many strange things had happened that day it might not be impossible to find that out as well, he thought. ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""Well, now you must bring me the king's daughter as soon as she has gone to sleep,"" he said; ""but she must not be awakened either on the way here or back. Do you hear that?"" he said. And before long the princess was lying on the bed. She slept so soundly and looked so wonderfully beautiful as she lay there. Yes, she was as sweet as sugar, I can tell you. The duke walked round about her, but she was just as beautiful from whatever point of view he looked at her. The more he looked the more he liked her. ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""You must now carry the princess home,"" he said, ""for now I know how she looks and tomorrow I will ask for her hand,"" he said. Next morning the king looked out of the window. ""I suppose I shall not be troubled with the sight of that palace anymore,"" he thought. But, zounds! There it stood just as on the day before, and the sun shone so brightly on the roof, and the weathercocks dazzled his eyes. He now became furious, and called all his men. They came quicker than usual. The courtiers bowed and scraped, and the soldiers stood at attention and presented arms. ""Do you see the palace there?"" screamed the king. They stretched their necks, and stared and gaped. Yes, of course, that they did. ""Have I not ordered you to pull down the palace and hang the builder?"" he said. Yes, they could not deny that; but then the colonel himself stepped forward and reported what had happened and how many soldiers the duke had, and how wonderfully grand the palace was. And next he told him what the duke had said, and how he had asked him to give his greetings to the king, and all that sort of thing. The king felt quite confused, and had to put his crown on the table and scratch his head. He could not understand all this, although he was a king; for he could take his oath it had all been built in a single night; and if the duke were not the evil one himself, he must in any case have done it by magic. While he sat pondering, the princess came into the room. ""Good morning to you, father!"" she said. ""Just fancy, I had such a strange and beautiful dream last night!"" she said. ""What did you dream then, my girl?"" said the king. ""I dreamed I was in the new palace over yonder, and that I saw a duke there, so fine and handsome that I could never have imagined the like; and now I want to get married, father,"" she said. ""Do you want to get married? -- you, who never cared to look at a man! That's very strange!"" said the king. ""That may be."" Said the princess; ""but it's different now, and I want to get married, and it's the duke I want,"" she said. The king was quite beside himself, so frightened did he become of the duke. But all of a sudden he heard a terrible noise of drums and trumpets and instruments of all kinds; and then came a message that the duke had just arrived with a large company, all of whom were so grandly dressed that gold and silver glistened in every fold. The king put on his crown and his coronation robes, and then went out on the steps to receive them. And the princess was not slow to follow him. The duke bowed most graciously, and the king of course did likewise, and when they had talked awhile about their affairs and their grandeur they became the best of friends. A great banquet was then prepared, and the duke was placed next to the princess at the table. What they talked about is not easy to tell, but the duke spoke so well for himself that the princess could not very well say ""No"" to anything he said, and then he went up to the king and asked for her hand. The king could not exactly say ""No"" either, for he could very well see that the duke was a person with whom it was best to be on friendly terms; but give his sanction there and then, he could not very well do that either. He wanted to see the duke's palace first, and find out about the state of affairs over there, as you may understand. So it was arranged that he should visit the duke and take the princess with him to see his palace; and with this they parted company. When the duke returned home, Lars became busier than ever, for there was so much to attend to. But he set to work and strove hard; and when the king and his daughter arrived everything was so magnificent and splendid that no words can describe it. They went through all the rooms and looked about, and they found everything as it should be, and even still more splendid, thought the king, and so he was quite pleased. The wedding then took place, and that in grand style; and on the duke's arrival home with his bride he, too, gave a great feast, and then there was an end to the festivities. Some time passed by, and one evening the duke heard these words: ""Are you satisfied now?"" It was Lars, as you may guess, but the duke could not see him. ""Well, I ought to be,"" said the duke. ""You have provided me with everything I have,"" he said. ""Yes, but what have I got in return?"" asked Lars. ""Nothing,"" said the duke; ""but, bless me, what could I have given you, who are not of flesh and blood, and whom I cannot see either?"" he said. ""But if there is anything I can do for you, tell me what it is, and I shall do it."" ""Well, I should like to ask you for that little scrap of paper which you found in the chest,"" said Lars. ""Nothing else?"" said the duke. ""If such a trifle can help you, I can easily do without it, for now I begin to know the words by heart,"" he said. Lars thanked the duke, and asked him to put the paper on the chair in front of the bed when he retired to rest, and he would be sure to fetch it during the night. The duke did as he was told; and so he and the princess lay down and went to sleep. But early in the morning the duke awoke and felt so cold that his teeth chattered, and when he had got his eyes quite open he found that he was quite naked and had not even as much as a thread on his back; and instead of the grand bed and the beautiful bedroom, and the magnificent palace, he lay on the big chest in the old tumble-down hut. He began to shout, ""Lars, my lad!"" But he got no answer. He shouted once more, ""Lars, my lad!"" But he got no answer this time either. So he shouted all he could, ""Lars, my lad!"" But it was all in vain. Now he began to understand how matters stood. When Lars had got the scrap of paper he was freed from service at the same time, and now he had taken everything with him. But there was no help for it. There stood the duke in the old hut quite naked; and as for the princess she was not much better off, although she had her clothes on, for she had got them from her father, so Lars had no power over them. The duke had now to tell the princess everything, and ask her to leave him. He would have to manage as best he could, he said. But she would not hear of it. She well remembered what the parson had said when he married them, and she would never, never leave him, she said. In the meantime the king in his palace had also awakened, and when he looked out of the window he did not see any sign whatever of the other palace where his daughter and son-in-law lived. He became uneasy, as you may imagine, and called his courtiers. They came in, and began to bow and scrape. ""Do you see the palace over yonder behind the forest?"" he asked. They stretched their necks and stared with all their might. No, they did not see it. ""Where had it gone to, then?"" asked the king. Well, really they did not know. It was not long before the king set out with all his court through the forest; and when he arrived at the place where the palace with the beautiful gardens should have been, he could not see anything but heather and juniper bushes and firs. But then he discovered the old tumble-down hut, which stood there among the bushes. He entered the hut and -- mercy on us! -- what a sight met his eyes! There stood his son-in-law, quite naked, and his daughter, who had not very many clothes on either, and who was crying and moaning. ""Dear, dear! what does all this mean?"" said the king; but he did not get any answer, for the duke would rather have died than tell him. The king did his utmost to get him to speak; but in spite of all the king's promises and threats the duke remained obstinate and would not utter a word. The king then became angry; and no wonder, for now he could see that this grand duke was not what he pretended to be, and so he ordered the duke to be hanged, and that without any loss of time. The princess begged and prayed for mercy; but neither prayers nor tears were of any help now; for an impostor he was, and as an impostor he should die, said the king. And so it had to be. They erected a gallows, and placed the rope round the duke's neck. But while they were getting the gallows ready, the princess got hold of the hangman, and gave both him and his assistant some money, that they should so manage the hanging of the duke that he should not lose his life, and in the night they were to cut him down, so that he and the princess might then flee the country. And that's how the matter was arranged. In the meantime they had strung up the duke, and the king and his court and all the people went their way. The duke was now in great straits. He had, however, plenty of time to reflect how foolish he had been in not saving some of the crumbs when he was living in plenty, and how unpardonably stupid he had been in letting Lars have the scrap of paper. This vexed him more than all. If only he had it again, he thought, they should see he had been gaining some sense in return for all he had lost. But it is of little use snarling if you haven't got any teeth. ""Ah, well, well!"" he sighed, and so he dangled his legs, which was really all he could do. The day passed slowly and tediously for him, and he was not at all displeased when he saw the sun setting behind the forest. But just before it disappeared he heard a fearful shouting, and when he looked down the hill, he saw seven cartloads of worn-out shoes, and on the top of the hindmost cart he saw a little old man in gray clothes and with a red pointed cap on his head. His face was like that of the worst scarecrow, and the rest of him was not very handsome either. He drove straight up to the gallows, and when he arrived right under it he stopped and looked up at the duke, and then burst out laughing, the ugly old fellow! ""How stupid you were!"" he said; ""but what should the fool do with his stupidity if he did not make use of it?"" And then he laughed again. ""Yes, there you are hanging now, and here am I carting away all the shoes I have worn out for your whims. I wonder if you can read what is written on this bit of paper, and if you recognize it?"" he said with an ugly laugh, holding up the paper before the duke's eyes. But all who hang are not dead, and this time it was Lars who was befooled. The duke made a clutch, and snatched the paper from him. ""Lars, my lad!"" ""What are master's orders?"" ""Well, you must cut me down from the gallows and put the palace and all the rest in its place again, exactly as it was before, and when the night has set in you must bring back the princess."" All went merrily as in a dance, and before long everything was in its place, just as it was when Lars took himself off. When the king awoke the next morning he looked out of the window, as was his custom, and there stood the palace again, with the weathercocks glittering so beautifully in the sunshine. He called his courtiers, and they came and began to bow and scrape. They stretched their necks as far as they could, and stared and gaped. ""Do you see the palace over there?"" said the king. Yes, of course, they did. The king then sent for the princess, but she was not to be found. He then went out to see if his son-in-law was still hanging on the gallows, but neither son-in-law nor gallows was to be seen. He had to lift off his crown and scratch his head. But that did not improve matters; he could not make head or tail of either one thing or the other. He set off at once with all his court through the forest, and when he came to the place where the palace should stand, there it stood sure enough. The gardens and the roses were exactly as they used to be, and the duke's people were to be seen everywhere among the trees. His son-in-law and his daughter received him on the steps, dressed in their finest clothes. ""Well, I never saw the like of this,"" said the king to himself; he could scarcely believe his own eyes, so wonderful did it all seem to him. ""God's peace be with you, father, and welcome here!"" said the duke. The king stood staring at him. ""Are you my son-in-law?"" he asked. ""Well, I suppose I am,"" said the duke. ""Who else should I be?"" ""Did I not order you to be hanged yesterday like any common thief?"" said the king. ""I think you must have been bewitched on the way,"" said the duke, with a laugh. ""Do you think I am the man to let myself be hanged? Or is there anyone here who dares to believe it?"" he said, and looked so fiercely at the courtiers that they felt as if they were being pierced through and through. They bowed and scraped and cringed before him. Who could believe such a thing? Was it at all likely? ""Well, if there is anyone who dares to say the king could have wished me such evil, let him speak out,"" said the duke, and fixed his eyes upon them still more fiercely than before. They went on bowing and scraping and cringing. How could anyone dare say such a thing? No, they had more sense than that, they should hope. The king did not know what to believe, for when he looked at the duke he thought he never could have wished him such evil; but still he was not quite convinced. ""Did I not come here yesterday, and was not the whole palace gone, and was there not an old hut in its place? And did not I go into that hut, and did not you stand stark naked right before my eyes?"" he asked. ""I wonder the king can talk so,"" said the duke. ""I think the trolls must have bewitched your eyes in the forest and made you quite crazy; or what do you think?"" he said, and turned round to the courtiers. They bowed and bowed till their backs were bent double, and agreed with everything he said, there could be no mistake about that. The king rubbed his eyes, and looked round about him. ""I suppose it is as you say, then,"" he said to the duke, ""and it is well I have got back my proper sight and have come to my senses again. For it would have been a sin and a shame if I had let you be hanged,"" he said; and so he was happy again, and nobody thought any more about the matter. ""Once bitten, twice shy,"" as the proverb says; and the duke now took upon himself to manage and look after most of his affairs, so that it was seldom Lars had to wear out his shoes. The king soon gave the duke half the kingdom into the bargain; so he had now plenty to do, and people said they would have to search a long time to find his equal in wise and just ruling. Then one day Lars came to the duke, looking very little better than the first time he had seen him; but he was, of course, more humble, and did not dare giggle and make grimaces. ""You do not want my help any longer, now,"" he said; ""for although I did wear out my shoes at first, I am now unable to wear out a single pair, and my feet will soon be covered all over with moss. So I thought I might now get my leave of absence,"" he said. The duke quite agreed with him. ""I have tried to spare you, and I almost think I could do without you,"" he said. ""But the palace and all the rest I do not want to lose, for such a clever builder as you I shall never get again; nor do I ever want to adorn the gallows again, as you can well understand; so I cannot give you back the paper on any account,"" he said. ""Well, as long as you have got it, I need not fear,"" said Lars; ""but if anybody else should get hold of it there will be nothing but running and trudging about again, and that's what I want to avoid; for when one has been tramping about for a thousand years, as I have done, one begins to get tired of it,"" he said. But they went on talking, and at last they agreed that the duke should put the paper in the box, and then bury it seven ells under the ground, under a stone fixed in the earth. They then gave mutual thanks for the time they had spent in each other's company, and so they parted. The duke carried out his part of the agreement, for he was not likely to want to change it. He lived happy and contented with the princess, and they had both sons and daughters. When the king died, he got the whole of the kingdom, and you may guess he was none the worse off for that; and there no doubt he still lives and reigns, if he is not dead. But as for the box with the scrap of paper in it, there are many who are still running about looking for it.","Sweden, G. Djurklo","Source: Fairy Tales from the Swedish of G. Djurklo, translated by H. L. Bræstad (London: William Heinemann, 1901), pp. 1-26.",NA,NA
The Blue Light,0562,Sir Buzz,"""Mother,"" said the son, ""give me four shillings, and I will go seek my fortune in the wide world."" ""Alas!"" answered the mother, ""and where am I, who haven't a farthing wherewith to buy bread, to find four shillings?"" ""There is that old coat of my father's,"" returned the lad. ""Look in the pocket -- perchance there is something there."" So she looked, and behold! there were six shillings hidden away at the very bottom of the pocket! ""More than I bargained for,"" quoth the lad, laughing. ""See, mother, these two shillings are for you. You can live on that till I return; the rest will pay my way until I find my fortune."" So he set off to find his fortune, and on the way lie saw a tigress, licking her paw, and moaning mournfully. He was just about to run away from the terrible creature, when she called to him faintly, saying, ""Good lad, if you will take out this thorn for me, I shall be forever grateful."" ""Not I!"" answered the lad. ""Why, if I begin to pull it out, and it pains you, you will kill me with a pat of your paw."" ""No, no!"" cried the tigress, ""I will turn my face to this tree, and when the pain comes I will pat it."" To this the soldier's son agreed; so he pulled out the thorn, and when the pain came the tigress gave the tree such a blow that the trunk split all to pieces. Then she turned towards the soldier's son, and said gratefully, ""Take this box as a reward, my son, but do not open it until you have traveled nine miles."" So the soldier's son thanked the tigress, and set off with the box to find his fortune. Now when he had gone five miles, he felt certain that the box weighed more than it had at first, and every step he took it seemed to grow heavier and heavier. He tried to struggle on -- though it was all he could do to carry the box -- until he had gone about eight miles and a quarter, when his patience gave way. ""I believe that tigress was a witch, and is playing off her tricks upon me,"" he cried, ""but I will stand this nonsense no longer. Lie there, you wretched old box! Heaven knows what is in you, and I don't care."" So saying, he flung the box down on the ground. It burst open with the shock, and out stepped a little old man. He was only one span high, but his beard was a span and a quarter long, and trailed upon the ground. The little manikin immediately began to stamp about and scold the lad roundly for letting the box down so violently. ""Upon my word!"" quoth the soldier's son, scarcely able to restrain a smile at the ridiculous little figure, "" but you are weighty for your size, old gentleman! And what may your name be?"" ""Sir Buzz!"" snapped the one-span manikin, still stamping about in a great rage. ""Upon my word!"" quoth the soldier's son once more, ""if you are all the box contained, I am glad I didn't trouble to carry it farther."" ""That's not polite,"" snarled the manikin. ""Perhaps if you had carried it the full nine miles you might have found something better; but that's neither here nor there. I'm good enough for you, at any rate, and will serve you faithfully according to my mistress's orders."" ""Serve me! Then I wish to goodness you'd serve me with some dinner, for I am mighty hungry! Here are four shillings to pay for it."" No sooner had the soldier's son said this and given the money, than with a whiz! boom! bing! like a big bee, Sir Buzz flew through the air to a confectioner's shop in the nearest town. There he stood, the one-span manikin, with the span and a quarter beard trailing on the ground, just by the big preserving pan, and cried in ever so loud a voice, ""Ho! ho! Sir Confectioner, bring me sweets!"" The confectioner looked round the shop, and out of the door, and down the street, but could see no one, for tiny Sir Buzz was quite hidden by the preserving pan. Then the manikin called out louder still, "" Ho! ho! Sir Confectioner, bring me sweets! "" And when the confectioner looked in vain for his customer, Sir Buzz grew angry, and ran and pinched him on the legs, and kicked him on the foot, saying, "" Impudent knave! do you mean to say you can't see me? Why, I was standing by the preserving pan all the time!"" The confectioner apologized humbly, and hurried away to bring out his best sweets for his irritable little customer. Then Sir Buzz chose about a hundredweight of them, and said, ""Quick, tie them up in something and give them into my hand; I'll carry them home."" ""They will be a good weight, sir,"" smiled the confectioner. ""What business is that of yours, I should like to know?"" snapped Sir Buzz. ""Just you do as you're told, and here is your money."" So saying he jingled the four shillings in his pocket. ""As you please, sir,"" replied the man cheerfully, as he tied up the sweets into a huge bundle and placed it on the little manikin's outstretched hand, fully expecting him to sink under the weight; when lo! with a boom! bing! he whizzed off with the money still in his pocket. He alighted at a corn-chandler's shop, and, standing behind a basket of flour, called out at the top of his voice, ""Ho! ho! Sir Chandler, bring me flour!"" And when the corn-chandler looked round the shop, and out of the window, and down the street, without seeing anybody, the one-span manikin, with his beard trailing on the ground, cried again louder than before, ""Ho! ho! Sir Chandler, bring me flour!"" Then on receiving no answer, he flew into a violent rage, and ran and bit the unfortunate corn-chandler on the leg, pinched him, and kicked him, saying, ""Impudent varlet! Don't pretend you couldn't see me! Why, I was standing close beside you behind that basket!"" So the corn-chandler apologized humbly for his mistake, and asked Sir Buzz how much flour he wanted. ""Two hundredweight,"" replied the manikin. ""Two hundredweight, neither more nor less. Tie it up in a bundle, and I'll take it with me."" ""Your honor has a cart or beast of burden with you, doubtless?"" said the chandler, ""for two hundredweight is a heavy load."" ""What's that to you? "" shrieked Sir Buzz, stamping his foot, "" isn't it enough if I pay for it? "" And then he jingled the money in his pocket again. So the corn-chandler tied up the flour in a bundle, and placed it in the manikin's outstretched hand, fully expecting it would crush him, when, with a whiz! Sir Buzz flew off, with the shillings still in his pocket. Boom! bing! boom! The soldier's son was just wondering what had become of his one-span servant, when, with a whir! the little fellow alighted beside him, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, as if he were dreadfully hot and tired, said thoughtfully, ""Now I do hope I've brought enough, but you men have such terrible appetites!"" ""More than enough, I should say,"" laughed the lad, looking at the huge bundles. Then Sir Buzz cooked the girdle-cakes, and the soldier's son ate three of them and a handful of sweets; but the one-span manikin gobbled up all the rest, saying at each mouthful, ""You men have such terrible appetites -- such terrible appetites!"" After that, the soldier's son and his servant Sir Buzz traveled ever so far, until they came to the king's city. Now the king had a daughter called Princess Blossom, who was so lovely, and tender, and slim, and fair, that she only weighed five flowers. Every morning she was weighed in golden scales, and the scale always turned when the fifth flower was put in, neither less nor more. Now it so happened that the soldier's son by chance caught a glimpse of the lovely, tender, slim, and fair Princess Blossom, and, of course, he fell desperately in love with her. He would neither sleep nor eat his dinner, and did nothing all day long but say to his faithful manikin, ""Oh, dearest Sir Buzz! oh, kind Sir Buzz! -- carry me to the Princess Blossom, that I may see and speak to her."" ""Carry you!"" snapped the little fellow scornfully. ""That's a likely story! Why, you're ten times as big as I am. You should carry me!"" Nevertheless, when the soldier's son begged and prayed, growing pale and pining away with thinking of the Princess Blossom, Sir Buzz, who had a kind heart, was moved, and bade the lad sit on his hand. Then with a tremendous boom! bing! boom! they whizzed away and were in the palace in a second. Being nighttime, the Princess was asleep; nevertheless the booming wakened her and she was quite frightened to see a handsome young man kneeling beside her. She began of course to scream, but stopped at once when the soldier's son with the greatest politeness, and in the most elegant of language, begged her not to be alarmed. And after that they talked together about everything delightful, while Sir Buzz stood at the door and did sentry; but he stood a brick up on end first, so that he might not seem to pry upon the young people. Now when the dawn was just breaking, the soldier's son and Princess Blossom, wearied of talking, fell asleep; whereupon Sir Buzz, being a faithful servant, said to himself, ""Now what is to be done? If my master remains here asleep, someone will discover him, and he will be killed as sure as my name is Buzz; but if I wake him, ten to one he will refuse to go."" So without more ado he put his hand under the bed, and bing! boom! carried it into a large garden outside the town. There he set it down in the shade of the biggest tree, and pulling up the next biggest one by the roots, threw it over his shoulder, and marched up and down keeping guard. Before long the whole town was in a commotion, because the Princess Blossom had been carried off, and all the world and his wife turned out to look for her. By and by the one-eyed chief constable came to the garden gate. ""What do you want here?"" cried valiant Sir Buzz, making passes at him with the tree. The chief constable with his one eye could see nothing save the branches, but he replied sturdily, ""I want the Princess Blossom!"" ""I'll blossom you! Get out of my garden, will you?"" shrieked the one-span manikin, with his one and quarter span beard trailing on the ground; and with that he belabored the constable's pony so hard with the tree that it bolted away, nearly throwing its rider. The poor man went straight to the king, saying, "" Your majesty! I am convinced your majesty's daughter, the Princess Blossom, is in your majesty's garden, just outside the town, as there is a tree there which fights terribly."" Upon this the king summoned all his horses and men, and going to the garden tried to get in; but Sir Buzz behind the tree routed them all, for half were killed, and the rest ran away. The noise of the battle, however, awoke the young couple, and as they were now convinced they could no longer exist apart, they determined to fly together. So when the fight was over, the soldier's son, the Princess Blossom, and Sir Buzz set out to see the world. Now the soldier's son was so enchanted with his good luck in winning the princess, that he said to Sir Buzz, "" My fortune is made already; so I shan't want you anymore, and you can go back to your mistress."" ""Pooh!"" said Sir Buzz. ""Young people always think so; however, have it your own way, only take this hair out of my beard, and if you should get into trouble, just burn it in the fire. I'll come to your aid."" So Sir Buzz boomed off, and the soldier's son and the Princess Blossom lived and traveled together very happily, until at last they lost their way in a forest, and wandered about for some time without any food. When they were nearly starving, a Brahman found them, and hearing their story said, ""Alas! you poor children! Come home with me, and I will give you something to eat."" Now had he said, ""I will eat you,"" it would have been much nearer the mark, for he was no Brahman, but a dreadful vampire, who loved to devour handsome young men and slender girls. But, knowing nothing of all this, the couple went home with him quite cheerfully. He was most polite, and when they arrived at his house, said, ""Please get ready whatever you want to eat, for I have no cook. Here are my keys; open all my cupboards save the one with the golden key. Meanwhile I will go and gather firewood."" Then the Princess Blossom began to prepare the food, while the soldier's son opened all the cupboards. In them he saw lovely jewels, and dresses, and cups and platters, such bags of gold and silver, that his curiosity got the better of his discretion, and, regardless of the Brahman's warning, he said, ""I will see what wonderful thing is hidden in the cupboard with the golden key."" So he opened it, and lo! it was full of human skulls, picked quite clean, and beautifully polished. At this dreadful sight the soldier's son flew back to the Princess Blossom, and said, ""We are lost! we are lost! This is no Brahman, but a horrid vampire!"" At that moment they heard him at the door, and the princess, who was very brave and kept her wits about her, had barely time to thrust the magic hair into the fire, before the vampire, with sharp teeth and fierce eyes, appeared. But at the selfsame moment a boom! boom! binging noise was heard in the air, coming nearer and nearer. Whereupon the vampire, who knew very well who his enemy was, changed into a heavy rain pouring down in torrents, hoping thus to drown Sir Buzz, but he changed into the storm wind beating back the rain. Then the vampire changed to a dove, but Sir Buzz, pursuing it as a hawk, pressed it so hard that it had barely time to change into a rose, and drop into King Indra's lap as he sat in his celestial court listening to the singing of some dancing girls. Then Sir Buzz, quick as thought, changed into an old musician, and standing beside the bard who was thrumming the guitar, said, ""Brother, you are tired; let me play."" And he played so wonderfully, and sang with such piercing sweetness, that King Indra said, ""What shall I give you as a reward? Name what you please, and it shall be yours."" Then Sir Buzz said, "" I only ask the rose that is in your Majesty's lap."" ""I had rather you asked more, or less,"" replied king Indra. ""It is but a rose, yet it fell from heaven; nevertheless it is yours."" So saying, he threw the rose towards the musician, and lo! the petals fell in a shower on the ground. Sir Buzz went down on his knees and instantly gathered them up; but one petal escaping, changed into a mouse. Whereupon Sir Buzz, with the speed of lightning, turned into a cat, which caught and gobbled up the mouse. Now all this time the Princess Blossom and the soldier's son, shivering and shaking, were awaiting the issue of the combat in the vampire's hut; when suddenly, with a bing! boom! Sir Buzz arrived victorious, shook his head, and said, ""You two had better go home, for you are not fit to take care of yourselves."" Then he gathered together all the jewels and gold in one hand, placed the Princess and the soldier's son in the other, and whizzed away home, to where the poor mother -- who all this time had been living on the two shillings -- was delighted to see them. Then with a louder boom! bing! boom! than usual, Sir Buzz, without even waiting for thanks, whizzed out of sight, and was never seen or heard of again. But the soldier's son and the Princess Blossom lived happily ever after.",India,"Source: Flora Annie Steel, Tales of the Punjab: Told by the People (London and New York: Macmillan and Company, 1894), pp. 1-12.","This story was also published under the title ""Sir Bumble"": F.

The Blue Light,0562,The Blue Light,"Once upon a time there was a soldier who had served the king loyally for many long years. When the war was over and the soldier could no longer serve because of the many wounds he had received, the king said to him, ""You can go home now. I no longer need you. There will be no more money for you, because wages are only for those who earn them."" Because the soldier did not know how he could earn a living, he sadly walked the whole day long, until he came to a forest in the evening. As darkness fell he saw a light. He approached it and came to a little house, where a witch lived. ""Give me a night's shelter and a little to eat and drink,"" he said to her, ""otherwise I will perish."" ""Oho!"" she answered. ""Who gives anything to a runaway soldier? But I will have pity and take you in after all, if you will do what I ask of you."" ""What do you want?"" asked the soldier. ""For you to dig up my garden tomorrow."" The soldier agreed, and the next day he worked with all his might, but could not finish before evening. ""I see,"" said the witch, ""that you can do no more work today. I will take you in for one more night if tomorrow you will cut up and split a stack of wood for me."" The soldier took the entire day to do this, and that evening the witch proposed that he remain a third night. ""Tomorrow I have only a small task for you. Behind my house there is a dry well into which my light has fallen. It burns blue and never goes out. I want you to get it for me."" The next day the old woman led him to the well and lowered him down it in a basket. He found the blue light and gave a sign that she should pull him up again. And she did pull him up, but when he was close to the edge, she wanted to take the blue light from him. ""No,"" he said, sensing her evil thoughts, ""I shall not give you the light until I am standing on the ground with both feet."" Then the witch became furious, let him fall back into the well, and walked away. The poor soldier fell to the damp floor without being injured. The blue light continued to burn, but how could that help him? He saw that would not be able to escape death. He sadly sat there for a while. Then he happened to reach into his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. ""This will be your last pleasure,"" he thought, pulled it out, lit it with the blue light, and began to smoke. After the fumes had wafted about the cavern, suddenly there stood before him a little black dwarf, who said, ""Master, what do you command?"" ""Why should I command you?"" replied the bewildered soldier. ""I must do everything that you demand,"" said the dwarf."" ""Good,"" said the soldier, ""then first help me out of this well."" The dwarf took him by the hand and led him through an underground passage, and he did not forget to take the blue light with him. Along the way he showed him the treasures that the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above ground, he said to the dwarf, ""Now go and bind the old witch and take her to the judge."" Not long afterward she came riding by on a tomcat as fast as the wind and screaming horribly. And not long after that the dwarf was back. ""It is all taken care of,"" he said. ""The witch is hanging on the gallows. Master, what do you command now?"" ""Nothing at the moment,"" answered the soldier. ""You can go home, but be ready when I call you."" ""It is only necessary,"" said the dwarf, ""for you to light your pipe with the blue light, and I will be with you."" With that he disappeared before his very eyes. The soldier returned to the city from which he had come. He moved into the best inn and had beautiful clothes made for himself. Then he told the innkeeper to furnish his room as luxuriously as possible. When it was finished he summoned the black dwarf and said, ""I served the king loyally, but he sent me away to starve. For this I now want revenge."" ""What am I to do?"" asked the little man. ""Late this evening, when the king's daughter is lying in bed, bring her here to me in her sleep. She shall do maid service for me."" The dwarf said, ""That is an easy thing for me, but a dangerous thing for you. If you are found out, it will not go well for you."" At the strike of twelve the door opened, and the dwarf carried the king's daughter in. ""Aha, is that you?"" cried the soldier. ""Get to work now! Go fetch the broom and sweep the room."" When she was finished he called her to his chair, stuck his feet out at her, and said, ""Pull off my boots,"" then threw them in her face, and she had to pick them up and clean them and make them shine. She did everything that he ordered her to do, without resisting, silently, and with half-closed eyes. At the first cock's crow, the dwarf carried her to the royal palace and back to her bed. The next morning, after the king's daughter had gotten up, she went to her father and told him that she had had an amazing dream. ""I was carried away through the streets as fast as lightning and taken to a soldier's room. I had to serve as his maid and wait on him and do common work, sweep the room, and clean his boots. It was only a dream, but still I am as tired as if I had really done it all."" ""The dream could have been true,"" said the king. ""I will give you some advice. Fill your pocket with peas, then make a small hole in your pocket. If you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track on the street."" As the king was thus speaking, the dwarf was invisibly standing nearby and heard everything. That night when he once again carried the sleeping princess through the streets, a few peas did indeed fall out of her pocket, but they did not leave a track, because the cunning dwarf had already scattered peas in all the streets. And once again the king's daughter had to do maid service until the cock crowed. The next morning the king sent his people out to look for the track, but it was to no end, for in all the streets there were poor children gathering peas and saying, ""Last night it rained peas."" ""We must think of something else,"" said the king. ""Leave your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you return from there, hide one of them. I will be sure to find it."" The black dwarf overheard this proposal, and that evening when the soldier again wanted the king's daughter brought to him, the dwarf advised him against this, saying that he had no way to protect him against such trickery. If the shoe were to be found in his room, it would not go well with him. ""Do what I tell you,"" replied the soldier, and for a third night the king's daughter had to work like a maid. But before she was carried back, she hid a shoe under the bed. The next morning the king had the entire city searched for the shoe, and it was found in the soldier's room. The soldier himself, following the little man's request, was already outside the city gate, but they soon overtook him and threw him into prison. In his haste, he had forgotten to take along his most valuable things: the blue light and the gold. He had only one ducat in his pocket. Standing at the window of his prison and weighted down with chains, he saw one of his comrades walking by. He knocked on the glass, and as he walked by, he said, ""Be so good and bring me the little bundle that I left at the inn. I'll give you a ducat for it."" The comrade ran forth and brought back the desired things. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lit his pipe and summoned the black dwarf. ""Have no fear,"" he said to his master. ""Just go where they lead you, and let everything happen, but take the blue light with you."" The next day the soldier was tried, and although he had done nothing wrong, the judge still sentenced him to death. As he was being led out, he asked the king for one last wish. ""What sort of a wish?"" asked the king. ""That I might smoke one more pipe on the way."" ""You can smoke three,"" answered the king, ""but do not think that I will let you live."" Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lit it with the blue light. As soon as a few rings of smoke had risen, the dwarf was standing there. He had a cudgel in his hand and said, ""What does my master command?"" ""Strike the false judges and their henchmen to the ground for me. And don't spare the king either, who has treated me so badly."" Then the dwarf took off like lightning, zip-zap, back and forth, and everyone he even touched with his cudgel fell to the ground and did not dare to move. The king became afraid. He begged for mercy, and in order to save his life, he gave to the soldier his kingdom as well as his daughter for a wife.",Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Das blaue Licht,"" Kinder und Hausmärchen, gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm, 7th edition, vol. 2 (Göttingen: verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 116, pp. 150-54.","This tale, in a somewhat simpler version, was introduced to the Grimms' Kinder- und Hausmärchen in 1815 (1st ed., vol. 2, no. 30).

The Blue Light,0562,The Deserter with the Tinderbox,"""You,"" she said, ""come with me."" She led him to a hollow tree, a thick one. ""Climb this tree,"" she said. ""Higher up there is a hole. Climb down into it. At the bottom you'll find a room where a dog is sitting on a chest. You must pick him up and set him on the floor. You can take as much money as you want from the chest, but then set the dog back where you found him. On the table there is a tinderbox. Put it in your pocket as well."" He did what she had told him to do and climbed down into the hole. Entering the room, he saw the dog seated on the chest. Its eyes were as large as a fist. ""See here,"" said the soldier, ""you are a good fellow. You won't do anything to me!"" He lifted the dog into his arms then set him on the floor. He opened the chest, which was filled with copper coins, and he filled his pockets with them. Then he closed the chest and set the dog back on it. He went into the second room, where there also was a light burning. He again saw a dog sitting on a chest, as in the first room, and this dog had eyes just as large as the first one. ""See here,"" he said, ""you won't do anything to me. The first one didn't do anything to me."" He picked this one up as well and set him down away from the chest. He opened it, and it was filled with silver coins. He emptied out his pockets and filled them with the silver coins. Then he closed the chest and put the dog back on it. Then he went into the third room. There a dog was sitting on a chest as well, and he was as large as the first two. ""Oh,"" said the soldier, ""I see that you three are good comrades. You won't do anything to me either."" He picked him up and set him on the floor. This chest was filled with gold ducats. He emptied out the silver coins and filled his pockets with ducats. Then he picked up the dog, placed him back on the chest, then returned to the tree. When he had climbed halfway up, the old woman asked, ""Do you have the tinderbox?"" So he climbed back down, for he had left the tinderbox in the third room where he had filled his pockets with ducats. It was there on the table, and he put it into his pocket. He made his way back up the tree to the outside, but the old woman had disappeared. He never saw her again. He came to an inn where a baptism was being celebrated. There he took off his uniform and bought civilians' clothes for himself. He lived very well. He traveled about for nearly an entire year, finally coming to a royal city. There he took quarters in an inn. Gradually he spent all the money that he had. He owed large sum to the innkeeper. One night at bedtime he had nothing to strike a light with. There was usually something at hand, but not this time. He picked up the tinderbox, and struck one spark, when suddenly the three dogs appeared in his room. ""What is your wish?"" they all three asked. ""Oh, I no longer have any money. Could you kindly bring me a chestful? ""You can always have as much money as you want from us,"" said the dogs, and disappeared. Thus he outfitted himself as a cavalier. One day he was out walking when the princess came riding by in her carriage. That evening he struck a spark with his tinderbox, and the three dogs appeared. ""Give us a command!"" they said. ""Bring the princess to me in her sleep!"" In an instant she was there in his bed, and the dogs disappeared. Before daybreak he called the three dogs with his tinderbox, and they carried the princess back to her own bed. And thus he had her brought to him every night for two weeks. Then she said to her father, the king, ""For two weeks now I have been with this man every night at the inn."" The king summoned the soldier and asked the princess if he were the man. She said, ""Yes, he's the one."" ""How can you take my child to bed with you every night?"" asked the king. ""Because she gives me pleasure,"" said the soldier. The king had him thrown into prison, where he stayed for eight days with only bread and water. He was sentenced to die on the gallows. On the ninth day he was brought to a room in the castle where he was put on display for three days. Unfortunately he did not have his tinderbox with him, so he could not help himself. Happily, on the second day a servant from the inn where he had been sleeping came to get a look at him. The soldier said to him, ""You, bring my tinderbox to me. It is in the pocket of the coat hanging on the wall."" The servant returned with the tinderbox, and the soldier said to him, ""You can have the chest filled with gold and everything else that is in the room."" On the third day the king called up three hundred men who surrounded the soldier then took him to the gallows. Arriving there, the soldier said to the king, ""Every condemned person is granted three last wishes."" Then he reached into his pocket and rubbed against the tinderbox. The three dogs were suddenly there. The soldier said, ""Take them and tear them apart."" And they tore the three hundred soldiers to pieces. The king begged for mercy, asking the soldier to spare him. He said, ""I give you my princess in marriage, and you can become king as well."" Three days later they celebrated their wedding, and the three dogs sat at the table next to the soldier. Each of the dogs had a napkin, a fork, and a knife, just like the humans. After the meal the three dogs told him to call on them whenever he might need them. Then they disappeared. They were always available to him and helped him both in war and in peace.",Austria,"Source: J. R.

The Blue Light,0562,The Giants and the Tinderbox,"Thus she lowered the apprentice into the shaft in a basket. Inside the shaft were a copper passageway, a silver passageway, and a connecting tunnel. A table stood in the connecting tunnel, and seated on the table was a fellow with claws on his fingers and on his feet. In front of him there was a tinderbox. The fellow gave the tinderbox to the cobbler's apprentice, as well as copper, silver, and gold. The apprentice then had the witch pull him back up. He gave the copper to the witch, but kept the silver, gold, and the tinderbox for himself. He went on his way, and with the gold and silver he was suddenly a wealthy man. Whenever he struck a light with the tinderbox two giants appeared before him and said, ""What is my lord's command?"" With time he came to the royal city, and one night he struck a light with the tinderbox. When the two giants appeared and asked, ""What is my lord's command?"" he answered, ""I want you to bring me the princess in her bed."" Not long afterward they brought the princess in her bed to the apprentice. From that time onward the same thing happened every night. When the king learned from the princess what was happening to her in the night, he commanded that a loosely bound bag of peas be fastened beneath her bed. By following the peas that fell out, one could discover where the princess was being taken each night. However, underway the giants noticed the bag of peas, and after they had brought the princess back to her room, they gathered up all the peas, so that no one could see where she had been. They did the same thing the next night when the king had a loosely bound bag of lentils fastened beneath her bed, and not a single lentil remained in the street. The next night when the giants brought the princess's bed to the apprentice, they said sadly, ""My lord, your last hour has struck. The king had a cow's bladder filled with blood fastened under the princess's bed, and we giants are not able to wipe up the blood that dripped out of the cow's bladder. In the morning the king will learn where the princess has been during the night, and he will have you executed."" Indeed, the next morning soldiers forced their way into the apprentice's room and took him prisoner. A golden scaffold was constructed on which he was to die. However, before he lay his head on the scaffold, he asked to be permitted to smoke one last pipeful of tobacco before his end. This wish was granted him, and he pulled the tinderbox from his pocket and struck a flame. The two giants appeared immediately, asking, ""What is my lord's command?"" He commanded them to capture the king and throw him into prison. And thus the cobbler's apprentice at once became king. He had the old king beheaded and married the princess.",Germany,"Source: Heinrich Pröhle, ""Die Riesen und das Stippfeuerzeug,"" Kinder- und Volksmärchen (Leipzig: Avenarius und Mendelssohn, 1953), no. 11, pp. 48-49.",NA,Translated by D.

The Blue Light,0562,The Iron Man,"Once he had to pass through a great forest, for at that time there were many large forests. He lost his way and had to eat roots and berries until finally he came to a charcoal burner who took him in and friendlily gave him shelter. The soldier liked it there in the solitude, and he and the charcoal burner became right good friends. He carried wood for the charcoal burner and helped him with everything he had to do. In the twilight of evening they both complained about their sorrows and told one another about their past. One day the charcoal burner said, ""Listen, friend, you are daring and brave. You can bring good fortune to both of us if you will only follow my advice. Not far from here there is a deep shaft where enormous treasures are buried. Are you willing to let me lower you down on a rope? Just bring me a bundle of candles; you can keep everything else that you bring up. You'll see that we shall have enough."" The soldier immediately agreed. The following morning the charcoal burner took a long rope, and they both went to the shaft. One, two, three, the soldier had the rope around his body, and the charcoal burner lowered him into the hole. Down at the bottom the soldier undid the rope, struck a light, and found a tunnel, which he followed until he came to an iron door that was closed with many bars. He opened it and entered a large hall that was entirely illuminated by a silver chandelier. It was as bright as day. In the middle a large iron man was seated on a throne with three chests standing nearby. However, they were locked shut. Above the door was hanging the bundle of candles. First of all the soldier reached for the candles; the man saw this, but did not move. Then the soldier went to one of the chests, which earlier had not been open, and behold, it was filled with shiny silver coins. He quickly filled his pockets. Then the second chest sprang open, and the most beautiful and largest gold pieces shone forth. He threw the silver coins back into their chest and filled his pockets with gold. He was scarcely finished when the third chest opened itself, in which the most valuable precious stones and pearls were glistening. He set the gold aside and filled his pockets with pearls and diamonds. The man did not move. The soldier left, and the iron man did not move. At the shaft the soldier tied the rope around his body again, then tugged, and he was pulled up. Above he gave the charcoal burner the candles and showed him his treasures. Both were delighted, and they retired. The next morning the charcoal burner was dead. What was the soldier to do? He took his treasures, including the candles, and with his staff in hand went forth into the wide world. He soon came out of the forest, then made his way to a large city where for a long time he lived gloriously and happily, thinking that his riches would have no end. But they did come to an end, and he did not have even enough money to buy oil for his lamp. Then he thought of the candles that he had brought from the shaft. He took one of them, lit it, and in that instant the iron man stood before him, asking him what he should do. The soldier now knew how things stood, and he told him to bring him a sack full of gold. In an instant he had the gold, the candle went out, and the man had disappeared. Now he had whatever he needed, and when anything was gone the iron man had to come and bring something new. From there the soldier traveled to the city where the king lived, whom he had served. Here he heard that the king's daughter was wonderfully beautiful, but that no one was allowed to see her. Having nothing better to do, and already leading an elegant life, the idea came to him that he wanted to see the princess. Therefore one evening at ten o'clock he lit his candle. The iron man entered his door and asked what he wished. ""Bring the king's daughter from the castle here to me."" The mighty servant disappeared, and a short time later was back with the princess. Now the soldier made the daughter pay for what her father had done to him. She had to wait on him, clean his boots, sweep the floors, etc. In short, she had to do the duties of an ordinary maid. The next morning before daybreak the iron man carried her back to her bedroom in the castle. When she awoke she went to her father and told him that she did not know if it had actually happened, or if she had only dreamed that she had been taken to a soldier's room and been forced to serve him. Looking at his daughter, the king saw a black spot on her face. Then he perceived that it could have been so, and said that this evening she should put a piece of chalk in her pocket, and that she should draw a line and a cross on the front door of the house where she was taken, so that they would be able to find the house again. This she did. However, the iron man noticed, and drew a line and a cross on every front door in the city. The next morning she again told her father what had happened to her. The king ordered his people to find the house where a line and a cross had been drawn. They returned without success, because this sign was on every house. The king became angry and ordered his soldiers to encircle the entire castle so that not even a mouse could enter or leave. And he posted a strong guard before his daughter's bedroom door. But nonetheless that evening she was taken away again, for no one could see the iron man. The next morning she again told of her experience, and that she had received a rough slap from the soldier that evening. The finger marks could still be seen on her cheek. This was too much for the king, and he quietly said into his daughter's ear, making three crosses at the same time, that this evening she should put on his gold ring and put it under the soldier's bed. This she did. ""Oh,"" she said the next morning. ""Last night he soldier beat me terribly because I refused to serve him properly."" Then the king ordered that every house in the city be searched for the soldier and the hidden ring. When they found the ring under a bed they were to bring the man who owned the bed to him. Before long the ring was found in the soldier's room, for he had not noticed that the princess had hidden it. Our soldier was condemned to the gallows, and his execution day was set. He had three days to prepare for his death. During this time he had the opportunity to send a messenger to his home for the candles. The messenger brought them, and now the iron man had to come and rescue the soldier. The iron man said, ""Wait until you are standing on the board beneath the gallows. Then you can have one last wish that will have to be granted to you. You have your candle; light it and I'll be there. I will do what I have to do. No one I touch will ever again have a headache."" And that is what happened. The soldier was happy and cheerful, which caused the prison guard to wonder more than a little. He ate and drank and slept so peacefully, as though he did not know that he was about to die. When he was finally standing on the board, and the hangman was about to tie the latest fashion in neckties on him, the soldier said, ""Wait, it's not yet time for that. I still have a request that you will surely grant me."" ""Yes,"" said the king, who had also come with his daughter, so that she could see what would happen to the scoundrel who had so abused her. ""Yes, the request shall be granted to you, if it is not an unreasonable one."" ""I only want to light my candle and see it burning one more time."" ""That can happen,"" said the king. So the candle was lit, and immediately the iron man was there with a thick cudgel. He first struck the hangman dead and then the people standing nearby, mowing them down viciously. The king took fright as the iron man moved closer and closer with his cudgel. He called out to the soldier, asking him to order the iron man to stop, and promising that soldier that he could have the princess as a wife. With that the soldier blew out the candle, and the iron man disappeared. The soldier received his wife, and now had the unlimited respect of everyone, even his father-in-law. And if the king ever resisted, the soldier had only to say, ""So, should the iron man come?"" Then everything happened that the soldier wanted. He later became king, and in times of war or great need he now and then called on the iron man, who always helped him. However, when the solder died, the candles disappeared as well.",Germany,"Source: August Ey, ""Der eiserne Mann,"" Harzmärchenbuch; oder, Sagen und Märchen aus dem Oberharze (Stade: Verlag von Fr.

The Blue Light,0562,The Soldier and the Tinderbox,"Then a little black dwarf approached him and asked him what was wrong: ""Why are you so sad?"" ""Oh,"" said the soldier, ""why shouldn't I be sad? During the war everything was all right. I had plenty of money and wine, but now I'm suffering from hunger and thirst. My clothes are in shreds, and my spirit is broken."" The dwarf encouraged him, saying, ""Just follow this path and you'll come to an enchanted castle guarded by many wild animals. There is a large stone in front of the castle. Sit down on it, and the animals will begin to roar fiercely, but just sit there quietly until the bell strikes twelve, and the animals will fall asleep. Then go into the castle, and you can take enough money to last a lifetime; but you must return before the bell strikes one, or things will go very badly for you."" The soldier thanked the dwarf and went down the path that he had shown him. Arriving at the castle, he sat down on the stone, and the wild animals on guard began to roar fiercely. The soldier ignored them and sat there quietly until twelve o'clock when the animals fell asleep. Then he went into the castle. He came first to a beautiful room filled with copper coins. A sleeping giant was lying there. The soldier filled his pockets and was about to leave when he noticed a second door. Opening it, he went into a second room that was even more beautiful than the first one. On the floor lay a large pile of silver coins, nothing but shining thalers. A giant was lying there as well, snoring. The soldier quickly threw away the copper coins and filled his pockets with the silver ones, thinking, ""Now you have enough money to last a lifetime. You'd better turn around."" But then he saw a third door, opened it, and looked inside. It was good that he did so, for there he saw a great pile of pure gold. A giant was lying there as well, fast asleep and snoring. He quickly threw away the silver coins and packed away as much gold as he could carry. He was about to leave when he saw a fourth door. He opened it and went inside the fourth and last room. It was more beautiful than even the most beautiful room in the king's palace. There was no money there, but the table was set with wine and roasts. It smelled delicious, and the plates, knives, and forks were made of pure gold. He sat down and treated his hungry stomach to a feast, drinking as much wine as he wanted. Now it was time for him to turn back. A pipe and tobacco pouch were hanging on the wall, and a tinderbox lay on the table. He pocketed these items as well, for he was a great friend of smoking. Then he made haste to leave the castle before his time was up. And he just made it, for the bell struck one as he arrived at the large stone. The wild animals awoke and began to roar fiercely. The soldier made his way onward with his riches, safely coming out of the woods, and finally arriving at the city where the king held court. He asked which was the best inn, then went inside and ordered a room. Because he was so tattered and dirty the innkeeper took him to the servants' quarters. ""These are miserable accommodations,"" said the soldier. ""Bring me some wine!"" The innkeeper fetched a bottle of the worst kind, thinking that it would be good enough for such a tramp, but the soldier, who had drunk the finest wine in the enchanted castle, knew full well how good wine should taste. He sampled the wine, pulled a face, and cried out, ""Bah! This wine is not drinkable! Bring a better one!"" The innkeeper calmed himself and brought a wine of medium quality, but the soldier, after sampling it, again cried out, ""Bah! Bring a better one, no matter what it costs! Here is the money!"" With that he threw a few cold coins onto the table. Seeing this, the innkeeper suddenly became very polite and brought a bottle of his best wine. ""So!"" said the soldier. ""I can drink this one. Now bring me to better quarters and get me out of this miserable hole."" The innkeeper, bowing deeply, took him to the best room in the inn. ""Now,"" said the soldier, ""bring a merchant to me who can buy clothes, horses, and a carriage for me."" The merchant arrived. ""Listen up,"" said the soldier. ""I want clothing as good as what the king wears, and three coaches, each with six horses: six black, six white, and six brown."" ""That is all well and good,"" said the merchant, ""but may I ask how you are going to pay for everything?"" ""Here is your money,"" said the soldier, reaching into his pocket. He threw a few handfuls of gold pieces onto the table, and the merchant left, bowing deeply. In short order the merchant provided everything that the soldier had requested. The soldier now lived in the greatest luxury. Every afternoon he drove in his coach through the city and past the king's palace. Now the king had three daughters, and every day they saw the soldier driving by in his elegant clothes and beautiful coach. The oldest one said, ""For sure he is a wealthy prince. I would like to invite him here as a guest."" She sent a servant to the inn with an invitation for the soldier. He came, bringing with him a bag filled with gold pieces. After dinner they played cards, and the soldier had such bad luck that he lost all the money that he had brought with him. The next evening the second princess invited him, and once again he was unlucky at cards, losing all the money that he had brought with him. On the third evening he was invited to visit the youngest and most beautiful princess. He wanted very much to go, but having no more money, he sold his coaches and horses. He received a good sum for them, and with this he went to the princess. After dinner they played cards, and the soldier again lost all his money. Now he was as poor as he had been when he left the army and had made his way through the world as a beggar. Out of sorts and frustrated, he returned to his inn and went to bed. He could not close his eyes, and he tossed and turned from one side to the other. Finally, unable to stay in bed any longer, he got up and paced back and forth in his room. He suddenly remembered the pipe and the tinderbox that he had brought from the enchanted castle. Finding no peace from his unhappy thoughts, he decided to distract himself by smoking his pipe. He picked up the tinderbox and struck a few sparks. At the first blow a huge, all-powerful giant stood before him, one of the three that had been guarding the money in the enchanted castle. ""What is my lord's command?"" asked the giant. ""Bring me a bagful of gold!"" said the soldier. He had scarcely uttered these words when the giant disappeared, then returned with a large bag filled with gold. ""So!"" said the soldier, ""Now bring the youngest princess to me."" The giant disappeared, then returned with the princess in her bed. After kissing her passionately, the soldier had the giant carry her away. The next morning the princess said to her mother, ""Oh, mother dear, I thought that a giant carried me in my bed to a handsome prince, who then kissed me."" ""My dear child,"" said the mother, ""that was only a dream. Don't think anymore about it."" The next evening the soldier again took the tinderbox and struck a flame. The giant appeared immediately and asked, ""What is my lord's command?"" ""Bring the princess to me,"" said the soldier. The giant disappeared and brought her in her bed. After the soldier once again had kissed her passionately, he had the giant carry her away. The next morning the princess said to her mother, ""Oh, mother dear, last night the same thing happened as the night before. A giant carried me to a handsome prince, who then kissed me."" ""My dear child,"" said the mother, ""that was only a dream. Don't think anymore about it."" However, the queen thought it was unusual that the girl should have the same dream two nights in a row. Wanting to know if there might be some truth to the matter, she sewed up a bag, filled it with peas, then cut a small hole in it so that the peas could slowly spill out, then hung the bag on the princess's bed. That night the giant once again carried the princess away, but without his noticing, the peas spilled out along the entire way. When the queen looked in the next morning she could see that her daughter's dreams were not unfounded. The scattered peas revealed to her the path that the giant had taken, and they led to the soldier's door at the inn. She took the innkeeper aside and asked him who the guest was, what his standing was, and where he came from. The innkeeper answered that he himself did not know for sure, but that it must be a discharged soldier who had suddenly come into a lot of money. When he had first arrived he had worn a dirty soldier's uniform. The queen ran and fetched a guard, who captured the soldier before he realized what was happening. They locked him up in a secure prison tower. The king, learning what had happened, sentenced the soldier to death. Now the soldier would have been able to free himself easily, if he only had had his tinderbox, but in his haste he had left it lying at the inn. He was to be executed the next day. That morning, before daybreak, he sat sadly before the prison bars. Looking out onto the street he saw the innkeeper's servant girl, who had just fetched milk. He called to her and promised her a lot of money if she would bring the tinderbox to him that he had forgotten in his room. The girl did indeed run and get it for him. The soldier struck fire, and immediately the giant stood before him. ""What is my lord's command?"" asked the giant. ""Free me from this prison,"" said the soldier. With that the giant disappeared, then returned with his two comrades. They broke down the walls, and the soldier walked away safely. Then the giants said, ""We have served you well, now you can do us the favor of redeeming us. A sword is hanging on the wall of the enchanted castle's first room. With this you must cut off our heads and those of the wild animals, and that will end our enchantment."" ""Yes,"" said the soldier, ""as difficult as that will be for me to do to you who have served me so well, if it must be done, I will do it willingly. But as a final act you must bring the youngest princess to me, for I cannot live without her."" The giants disappeared, then brought her to him. The soldier took her with him to the enchanted castle. Once again he sat down on the large stone until the bell struck twelve. Then he went into the castle, found the sword, and struck off the heads of the giants and the wild animals guarding the castle. Suddenly the most beautiful music sounded forth and a swarm of happy people advanced. They paid homage to him as their king. Soon afterward the soldier married his beautiful princess.",Germany,"Source: Wilhelm Busch, ""Der Soldat und das Feuerzeug,"" Ut ôler Welt: Volksmärchen, Sagen, Volkslieder und Reime (Munich: Lothar Joachim Verlag, 1910), no. 32, pp. 77-82.",NA,Translated by D.

The Blue Light,0562,The Three Dogs,"""Oh yes,"" she answered. ""Bring me the tinderbox which is there. I forgot it."" The soldier went to the tree and climbed down inside it. Below there stood a large chest, and sitting on it was a dog who had eyes in his head that were as large as saucers. A second chest was also there, and on it sat a dog with eyes as large as plates, and a third chest was there with eyes as large as serving platters. With no further ado the soldier set all three dogs onto the old apron and opened the chests. In the first one was copper money, in the second one silver money, and in the third one minted gold. From this chest he took as much as he could carry, not forgetting to pick up the tinderbox as well. Then he climbed out of the hollow tree and went on his way. Not long afterward he again met the old woman, who asked him for the tinderbox, but he did not want to give it to her. They began quarreling over it, and the soldier struck the old woman dead. He now had money enough and was able to live well, but he spent so much that it soon came to an end. With time his many friends abandoned him, until at last he was living desolate and alone. One day he wanted to light a pipe, and for this he used the tinderbox, which he had long forgotten. He suddenly discovered what the tinderbox was good for. The three dogs immediately appeared and asked him what he wished. He told them to bring him some money. Less than a half hour later the dogs returned with a large sum of money. Now he was once again wealthy, and thought he would like to marry the princess, who lived in the city. But he did not know where to begin, because he was not at all handsome. Then he called his dogs and asked them if they knew how to make it happen. ""We can do that,"" replied the dogs, and ran away. That evening all three went to the castle and brought the princess on their backs to the soldier. Afterward they took her back to the castle in the same way. The next morning the princess told about this, as though it had been a dream. However, the king was concerned and posted guards outside her bedroom door. When the dogs returned the next night the guards were asleep, so the dogs took the princess with them again. However, one soldier saw them, followed them, and drew a mark on the house that they ran into. But the dogs observed this, and they drew marks on all the houses, so that no one could know where the princess had been. On the third evening the dogs fetched the princess again. This time the soldier scattered peas in front of the house, but the dogs gathered up all the peas. On the fourth day the soldier himself went to the king and asked for his daughter's hand in marriage, but the king had him thrown into prison. Now he was lost, for he did not have his tinderbox with him, and was not able to call the dogs. He thought long and hard how he might escape, but nothing came to him. Then a boy walked beneath his window, and the soldier asked him to do him a favor, the last one, because in only a few days he was to die. The boy was willing. He asked him to fetch the tinderbox that was in his room, and described exactly where it was. The boy soon returned with the tinderbox, and the soldier pulled it up to his barred window with a string. ""Now everything is all right,"" he thought. Later when he was standing at the place of execution he asked permission to smoke one last time, and this was granted him. He had scarcely struck a light when the three dogs arrived. He said to them, ""Attack!"" and they tore apart the judges and the king. Then the soldier married the princess. He lived very happily with her, and if they have not died then they are still alive.","Germany, Georg Schambach and Wilhelm Müller","Source: Georg Schambach and Wilhelm Müller, ""Die Drei Hunde,"" Niedersächsische Sagen und Märchen: Aus dem Munde des Volkes gesammelt (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht's Verlag, 1855), pp. 285-87.",NA,Translated by D.

The Blue Light,0562,The Tinderbox,"She said, ""Good evening, soldier! What a nice sword you've got, and such a big knapsack; you are a real soldier! You shall have as much money as ever you like!"" ""Thank you kindly, you old witch!"" said the soldier. ""Do you see that big tree!"" said the witch, pointing to a tree close by. ""It is hollow inside! Climb up to the top and you will see a hole into which you can let yourself down, right down under the tree! I will tie a rope round your waist so that I can haul you up again when you call!"" ""What am I to do down under the tree?"" asked the soldier. ""Fetch money!"" said the witch. ""You must know that when you get down to the bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a wide passage; it's quite light there, for there are over a hundred blazing lamps. You will see three doors which you can open, for the keys are there. If you go into the first room you will see a big box in the middle of the floor. A dog is sitting on the top of it, and he has eyes as big as saucers, but you needn't mind that. I will give you my blue checked apron, which you can spread out on the floor; then go quickly forward, take up the dog and put him on my apron, open the box and take out as much money as ever you like. It is all copper, but if you like silver better, go into the next room. There you will find a dog with eyes as big as millstones; but never mind that, put him on my apron and take the money. If you prefer gold you can have it too, and as much as you can carry, if you go into the third room. But the dog sitting on that box has eyes each as big as the Round Tower. He is a dog, indeed, as you may imagine! But don't let it trouble you; you only have to put him on to my apron and then he won't hurt you, and you can take as much gold out of the box as you like!"" ""That's not so bad!"" said the soldier. ""But what am I to give you, old witch? For you'll want something, I'll be bound."" ""No,"" said the witch, ""not a single penny do I want; I only want you to bring me an old tinderbox that my grandmother forgot the last time she was down there!"" ""Well! tie the rope round my waist!"" said the soldier. ""Here it is,"" said the witch, ""and here is my blue-checked apron."" Then the soldier climbed up the tree, let himself slide down the hollow trunk, and found himself, as the witch had said, in the wide passage where the many hundred lamps were burning. Now he opened the first door. Ugh! There sat the dog with eyes as big as saucers staring at him. ""You are a nice fellow!"" said the soldier, as he put him on to the witch's apron, and took out as many pennies as he could cram into his pockets. Then he shut the box, and put the dog on the top of it again, and went into the next room. Hallo! there sat the dog with eyes as big as millstones. ""You shouldn't stare at me so hard; you might get a pain in your eyes!"" Then he put the dog on the apron, but when he saw all the silver in the box he threw away all the coppers and stuffed his pockets and his knapsack with silver. Then he went on into the third room. Oh! how horrible! that dog really had two eyes as big as the Round Tower, and they rolled round and round like wheels. ""Good evening!"" said the soldier, saluting, for he had never seen such a dog in his life; but after looking at him for a bit he thought, ""That will do,"" and then he lifted him down on to the apron and opened the chest. Preserve us! What a lot of gold! He could buy the whole of Copenhagen with it, and all the sugar pigs from the cake-women, all the tin soldiers, whips and rocking-horses in the world! That was money indeed! Now the soldier threw away all the silver he had filled his pockets and his knapsack with, and put gold in its place. Yes, he crammed all his pockets, his knapsack, his cap and his boots so full that he could hardly walk! Now, he really had got a lot of money. He put the dog back on to the box, shut the door, and shouted up through the tree, "" Haul me up, you old witch!"" ""Have you got the tinderbox?"" ""Oh! to be sure!"" said the soldier. ""I had quite forgotten it."" And he went, back to fetch it. The witch hauled him up, and there he was standing on the high road again with his pockets, boots, knapsack and cap full of gold. ""What do you want the tinderbox for?"" asked the soldier. ""That's no business of yours,"" said the witch. ""You've got the money; give me the tinderbox!"" ""Rubbish!"" said the soldier. ""Tell me directly what you want with it, or I will draw my sword and cut off your head."" ""I won't!"" said the witch. Then the soldier cut off her head; there she lay! But he tied all the money up in her apron, slung it on his back like a pack, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and marched off to the town. It was a beautiful town, and he went straight to the finest hotel, ordered the grandest rooms and all the food he liked best, because he was a rich man now that he had so much money. Certainly the servant who had to clean his boots thought they were very funny old things for such a rich gentleman, but he had not had time yet to buy any new ones; the next day he bought new boots and fine clothes. The soldier now became a fine gentleman, and the people told him all about the grand things in the town, and about their king, and what a lovely princess his daughter was. ""Where is she to be seen?"" asked the soldier. ""You can't see her at all! "" they all said. ""She lives in a great copper castle surrounded with walls and towers. Nobody but the king dare go in and out, for it has been prophesied that she will marry a common soldier, and the king doesn't like that!"" ""I should like to see her well enough!"" thought the soldier. But there was no way of getting leave for that. He now led a very merry life; went to theaters, drove about in the King's Park, and gave away a lot of money to poor people, which was very nice of him; for he remembered how disagreeable it used to be not to have a penny in his jpocket. Now he was rich, wore fine cloth, and had a great many friends, who all said what a nice fellow he was -- a thorough gentleman -- and he liked to be told that. But as he went on spending money every day and his store was never renewed, he at last found himself with only two pence left. Then he was obliged to move out of his fine rooms. He had to take a tiny little attic up under the roof, clean his own boots, and mend them himself with a darning needle. None of his friends went to see him, because there were far too many stairs. One dark evening when he had not even enough money to buy a candle with, he suddenly remembered that there was a little bit in the old tinderbox he had brought out of the hollow tree, when the witch helped him down. He got out the tinderbox with the candle end in it and struck fire, but as the sparks flew out from the flint the door burst open and the dog with eyes as big as saucers, which he had seen down under the tree, stood before him and said, "" What does my lord command?"" ""By heaven!"" said the soldier, ""this is a nice kind of tinderbox, if I can get whatever I want like this! Get me some money,"" he said to the dog, and away it went. It was back in a twinkling with a big bag full of pennies in its mouth. Now the soldier saw what a treasure he had in the tinderbox. If he struck once, the dog which sat on the box of copper came; if he struck twice, the dog on the silver box came, and if he struck three times, the one from the box of gold. He now moved down to the grand rooms and got his fine clothes again, and then all his friends knew him once more and liked him as much as ever. Then he suddenly began to think: After all it's a curious thing that no man can get a sight of the princess! Everyone says she is so beautiful! But what is the good of that, when she always has to be shut up in that big copper palace with all the towers. Can I not somehow manage to see her? Where is my tinderbox? Then he struck the flint, and, whisk, came the dog with eyes as big as saucers. ""It certainly is the middle of the night,"" said the soldier, ""but I am very anxious to see the princess, if only for a single moment."" The dog was out of the door in an instant, and before the soldier had time to think about it, he was back again with the princess. There she was fast asleep on the dog's back, and she was so lovely that anybody could see that she must be a real princess! The soldier could not help it, but he was obliged to kiss her, for he was a true soldier. Then the dog ran back again with the princess, but in the morning when the king and queen were having breakfast, the princess said that she had had such a wonderful dream about a dog and a soldier. She had ridden on the dog's back, and the soldier had kissed her. ""That's a pretty tale,"" said the queen. After this an old lady-in-waiting had to sit by her bed at night to see if this was really a dream, or what it could be. The soldier longed so intensely to see the princess again that at night the dog came to fetch her. He took her up and ran off with her as fast as he could, but the old lady-in-waiting put on her galoshes and ran just as fast behind them; when she saw that they disappeared into a large house, she thought, ""Now I know where it is,"" and made a big cross with chalk on the gate. Then she went home and lay down, and presently the dog came back, too, with the princess. When he saw that there was a cross on the gate, he took a bit of chalk, too, and made crosses on all the gates in the town. Now this was very clever of him, for the lady-in-waiting could not possibly find the gate when there were crosses on all the gates. Early next morning the king, the queen, the lady-in-waiting, and all the court officials went to see where the princess had been. ""There it is,"" said the king, when he saw the first door with the cross on it. ""No, my dear husband, it is there,"" said the queen, who saw another door with a cross on it. ""But there is one, and there is another!"" they all cried out. They soon saw that it was hopeless to try and find it. Now the queen was a very clever woman; she knew more than how to drive in a chariot. She took her big gold scissors and cut up a large piece of silk into small pieces, and made a pretty little bag, which she filled with fine grains of buckwheat. She then tied it onto the back of the princess, and when that was done she cut a little hole in the bag, so that the grains could drop out all the way wherever the princess went. At night the dog came again, took the princess on his back, and ran off with her to the soldier, who was so fond of her that he longed to be a prince, so that he might have her for his wife. The dog never noticed how the grain dropped out all along the road from the palace to the soldier's window, where he ran up the wall with the princess. In the morning the king and the queen easily saw where their daughter had been, and they seized the soldier and threw him into the dungeons. There he lay! Oh, how dark and tiresome it was, and then one day they said to him, ""Tomorrow you are to be hanged."" It was not amusing to be told that, especially as he had left his tinderbox behind him at the hotel. In the morning he could see through the bars in the little window that the people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the drums and saw the soldiers marching along. All the world was going; among them was a shoemaker's boy in his leather apron and slippers. He was in such a hurry that he lost one of his slippers, and it fell close under the soldier's window where he was peeping out through the bars. ""I say, you boy! Don't be in such a hurry,"" said the soldier to him. ""Nothing will happen till I get there! But if you will run to the house were I used to live, and fetch me my tinderbox, you shall have a penny! You must put your best foot foremost!"" The boy was only too glad to have the penny, and tore off to get the tinderbox, gave it to the soldier, and -- yes, now we shall hear. Outside the town a high scaffold had been raised, and the soldiers were drawn up round about it, as well as crowds of the townspeople. The king and the queen sat upon a beautiful throne exactly opposite the judge and all the councillors. The soldier mounted the ladder, but when they were about to put the rope round his neck, he said that before undergoing his punishment a criminal was always allowd the gratification of a harmless wish, and he wanted very much to smoke a pipe, as it would be his last pipe in this world. The king would not deny him this, so the soldier took out his tinderbox and struck fire, once, twice, three times, and there were all the dogs. The one with eyes like saucers, the one with eyes like millstones, and the one whose eyes were as big as the Round Tower. ""Help me! Save me from being hanged!"" cried the soldier. And then the dogs rushed at the soldiers and the councillors; they took one by the legs, and another by the nose, and threw them up many fathoms into the air; and when they fell down, they were broken all to pieces. ""I won't!"" cried the king, but the biggest dog took both him and the queen and threw them after all the others. Then the soldiers became alarmed, and the people shouted, ""Oh! good soldier, you shall be our king and marry the beautiful princess!"" Then they conducted the soldier to the king's chariot, and all three dogs danced along in front of him and shouted, ""Hurrah!"" The boys all put their fingers in their mouths and whistled, and the soldiers presented arms. The princess came out of the copper palace and became queen, which pleased her very much. The wedding took place in a week, and the dogs all had seats at the table, where they sat staring with all their eyes.","Denmark, Hans Christian Andersen","Source: Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen (London: J.

The Blue Light,0562,The Transverse Flute,"This saddened Hans, for he had no desire to get married. The father became angry and said, ""Why are you making such a sour face?"" Hans replied, ""I don't want to get married. I won't even think of it."" ""Why not?"" asked the father angrily. ""Didn't I get married, and didn't it serve me well?"" ""I believe you,"" answered the son, ""but you had my blessed mother. Do you want me to live with a total stranger?"" Whatever the father said, he could not talk Hans into getting married, so he himself fetched a new wife into the household. This was a great misfortune for Hans, for when the stepmother gave birth to her own son, she succeeded in sowing discord between Hans and his father, until finally Hans was forced to leave home. He took a sausage from the smoking rack, cut a sturdy stick from his father's bush, then wandered off into the wide world. Toward evening he came into a large forest, lost his way, and was in great distress. He heard a rustling in the brush and a gray dwarf stepped forward, saying, ""I'm hungry. Give me something to eat!"" Hans reached into his pocket, pulled out the sausage, and gave it to the dwarf. Then the dwarf reached into his pocket, pulled out a transverse flute, then gave it to Hans, saying, ""If you are in need, just blow!"" With that the dwarf disappeared. Has was tired, so he lay down in the grass and fell asleep. The next morning he wandered further, and when he became hungry he blew on the flute. Two large wolfhounds suddenly appeared; the one had a sausage in his mouth, the other a loaf of bread. Hans ate until he was full, then wandered onward. Toward evening a wolf approached him and threatened to tear him apart. Hans blew on his flute and the dogs suddenly appeared and tore the wolf apart. The next day he again blew on the flute when he was hungry, and the dogs brought him bread and sausage. The same thing happened on the third day. And, when a bear attacked him toward evening on the second day, he blew on the flute, and the dogs appeared and tore the bear apart. Toward evening on the third day he came to a cave. A cannibal woman lived there with her son. Hans asked them for shelter, which they gladly offered him, for they intended to strangle him in the night, and then eat him. Time went by slowly for him, but that night when they came into his room to kill him, he blew on his flute. The dogs appeared and tore the cannibal and her son to pieces. When Hans awoke the next morning he found himself in the middle of a large city. during the night the dogs had carried him there. The innkeeper came to him and said, ""Have you heard the news? Last night the dragon carried the princess away. Whoever can rescue her can have her and become king."" Hans went out and followed the dragon's tracks. Before long he found himself back in the great forest. The dragon was lying beneath a large oak tree, and the princess was petting his head. Hans pulled the princess away. The dragon woke up and attempted to eat Hans. He blew on his flute. The dogs appeared and tore the dragon apart. Hans took the princess to her father, who said to him, ""Do you want her?"" ""Yes,"" said Hans. ""She looks like my mother, only younger and more noble. Therefore I would like her."" Then they married and lived many years together in peace and joy.",Germany,"Source: Carl and Theodor Colshorn, ""Die Querpfeife,"" Märchen und Sagen (Hannover: Verlag von Carl Rümpler, 1854), no. 43, pp. 141-43.","The Colshorns' source: ""Oral, from Vollbüttel.""",Translated by D.

Bluebeard,0312,Bluebeard,"There was once a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold. But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard, which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him. One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties. He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him. Neither of them would have him, and they sent him backwards and forwards from one to the other, not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard. Adding to their disgust and aversion was the fact that he already had been married to several wives, and nobody knew what had become of them. Bluebeard, to engage their affection, took them, with their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the neighborhood, to one of his country houses, where they stayed a whole week. The time was filled with parties, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other. In short, everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think that the man's beard was not so very blue after all, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman. As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a month afterwards, Bluebeard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence. He desired her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to take them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was. ""Here,"" said he,"" are the keys to the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture. These are to my silver and gold plate, which is not everyday in use. These open my strongboxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels. And this is the master key to all my apartments. But as for this little one here, it is the key to the closet at the end of the great hall on the ground floor. Open them all; go into each and every one of them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you happen to open it, you may expect my just anger and resentment."" She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered. Then he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey. Her neighbors and good friends did not wait to be sent for by the newly married lady. They were impatient to see all the rich furniture of her house, and had not dared to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them. They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another. After that, they went up into the two great rooms, which contained the best and richest furniture. They could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent that they had ever seen. They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor. She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very uncivil for her to leave her company, she went down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she nearly fell and broke her neck. Having come to the closet door, she made a stop for some time, thinking about her husband's orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong that she could not overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling. At first she could not see anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls. (These were all the wives whom Bluebeard had married and murdered, one after another.) She thought she should have died for fear, and the key, which she, pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand. After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she picked up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to recover; but she could not, so much was she frightened. Having observed that the key to the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off; but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other. Bluebeard returned from his journey the same evening, saying that he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about had concluded to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him that she was extremely happy about his speedy return. The next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened. ""What!"" said he, ""is not the key of my closet among the rest?"" ""I must,"" said she, ""have left it upstairs upon the table."" ""Fail not,"" said Bluebeard, ""to bring it to me at once."" After several goings backwards and forwards, she was forced to bring him the key. Bluebeard, having very attentively considered it, said to his wife, ""Why is there blood on the key?"" ""I do not know,"" cried the poor woman, paler than death. ""You do not know!"" replied Bluebeard. ""I very well know. You went into the closet, did you not? Very well, madam; you shall go back, and take your place among the ladies you saw there."" Upon this she threw herself at her husband's feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance, vowing that she would never more be disobedient. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Bluebeard had a heart harder than any rock! ""You must die, madam,"" said he, ""at once."" ""Since I must die,"" answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears), ""give me some little time to say my prayers."" ""I give you,"" replied Bluebeard, ""half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more."" When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her, ""Sister Anne"" (for that was her name), ""go up, I beg you, to the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming. They promised me that they would come today, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste."" Her sister Anne went up to the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time, ""Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?"" And sister Anne said, ""I see nothing but a cloud of dust in the sun, and the green grass."" In the meanwhile Bluebeard, holding a great saber in his hand, cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife, ""Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you."" ""One moment longer, if you please,"" said his wife; and then she cried out very softly, ""Anne, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"" And sister Anne answered, ""I see nothing but a cloud of dust in the sun, and the green grass."" ""Come down quickly,"" cried Bluebeard, ""or I will come up to you."" ""I am coming,"" answered his wife; and then she cried, ""Anne, sister Anne, do you not see anyone coming?"" ""I see,"" replied sister Anne, ""a great cloud of dust approaching us."" ""Are they my brothers?"" ""Alas, no my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep."" ""Will you not come down?"" cried Bluebeard. ""One moment longer,"" said his wife, and then she cried out, ""Anne, sister Anne, do you see nobody coming?"" ""I see,"" said she, ""two horsemen, but they are still a great way off."" ""God be praised,"" replied the poor wife joyfully. ""They are my brothers. I will make them a sign, as well as I can for them to make haste."" Then Bluebeard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble. The distressed wife came down, and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders. ""This means nothing,"" said Bluebeard. ""You must die!"" Then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with the other, he prepared to strike off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself. ""No, no,"" said he, ""commend yourself to God,"" and was just ready to strike. At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Bluebeard made a sudden stop. The gate was opened, and two horsemen entered. Drawing their swords, they ran directly to Bluebeard. He knew them to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer; so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the two brothers pursued and overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch. Then they ran their swords through his body and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers. Bluebeard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains' commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Bluebeard. Moral: Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly. Another moral: Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband's beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is.",Charles Perrault,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Blue Fairy Book, 5th edition (London and New York: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1891), pp. 290-95.

Bluebeard,0312,Don Firriulieddu,"Once upon a time there was a farmer who had a daughter who used to take his dinner to him in the fields. One day he said to her, ""So that you may find me I will sprinkle bran along the way. You follow the bran, and you will come to me."" By chance the old ogre passed that way, and seeing the bran, said, ""This means something."" So he took the bran and scattered it so that it led to his own house. When the daughter set out to take her father his dinner, she followed the bran until she came to the ogre's house. When the ogre saw the young girl, he said, ""You must be my wife."" Then she began to weep. When the father saw that his daughter did not appear, he went home in the evening, and began to search for her, and not finding her, he asked God to give him a son or a daughter. A year after, he had a son whom they called Don Firriulieddu. When the child was three days old it spoke, and said, ""Have you made me a cloak? Now give me a little dog and the cloak, for I must look for my sister."" So he set out and went to seek his sister. After a while he came to a plain where he saw a number of men, and asked, ""Whose cattle are these?"" The herdsman replied, ""They belong to the ogre, who fears neither God nor the saints, who fears Don Firriulieddu, who is three days old, and is on the way, and gives his dog bread and says, 'Eat, my dog, and do not bark, for we have fine things to do.'"" Afterwards he saw a flock of sheep, and asked, ""Whose are these sheep?"" and received the same answer as from the herdsman. Then he arrived at the ogre's house and knocked, and his sister opened the door and saw the child. ""Who are you looking for?"" she said. ""I am looking for you, for I am your brother, and you must return to mamma."" When the ogre heard that Don Firriulieddu was there, he went and hid himself upstairs. Don Firriulieddu asked his sister, ""Where is the ogre?"" ""Upstairs."" Don Firriulieddu said to his dog, ""Go upstairs and bark, and I will follow you."" The dog went up and barked, and Firriulieddu followed him, and killed the ogre. Then he took his sister and a quantity of money, and they went home to their mother, and are all contented.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 76, pp. 241-42.",Type 312.,NA
Bluebeard,0312,King,"Next to a great forest there lived an old man who had three sons and two daughters. Once they were sitting together thinking of nothing when a splendid carriage suddenly drove up and stopped in front of their house. A dignified gentleman climbed from the carriage, entered the house, and engaged the father and his daughters in conversation. Because he especially liked the youngest one, he asked the father if he would not give her to him to be his wife. This seemed to the father to be a good marriage, and he had long desired to see his daughters taken care of while he was still alive. However, the daughter could not bring herself to say yes, for the strange knight had an entirely blue beard, which caused her to shudder with fear whenever she looked at him. She went to her brothers, who were valiant knights, and asked them for advice. The brothers thought that she should accept Bluebeard, and they gave her a little whistle, saying, ""If you are ever threatened, just blow this whistle, and we will come to your aid!"" Thus she let herself be talked into becoming the strange man's wife, but she did arrange for her sister to accompany her when King Bluebeard took her to his castle. When the young wife arrived there, there was great joy throughout the entire castle, and King Bluebeard was very happy as well. This continued for about four weeks, and then he said that he was going on a journey. He turned all the keys of the castle over to his wife, saying, ""You may go anywhere in the castle, unlock everything, and look at anything you want to, except for one door, to which this little golden key belongs. If you value your life, you are not allowed to open it!"" ""Oh no!"" she said, adding that she surely would not open that door. But after the king had been away for a while, she could find no rest for constantly thinking about what there might be in the forbidden chamber. She was just about to unlock it when her sister approached her and held her back. However, on the morning of the fourth day, she could no longer resist the temptation, and taking the key she secretly crept to the room, stuck the key into the lock, and opened the door. Horrified, she saw that the entire room was filled with corpses, all of them women. She wanted to slam the door shut immediately, but the key fell out and into the blood. She quickly picked it up, but it was stained with blood. And however much she rubbed and cleaned it, the stains would not go away. With fear and trembling she went to her sister. When King Bluebeard finally returned from his journey, he immediately asked for the golden key. Seeing the bloodstains on it, he said, ""Wife, why did you not heed my warning? Your hour has now struck! Prepare yourself to die, for you have been in the forbidden room!"" Crying, she went to her sister, who lived upstairs in the castle. While she was bemoaning her fate to her, the sister thought of the whistle that she had received from her brothers, and said, ""Give me the whistle! I shall send a signal to our brothers. Perhaps they will be able to help!"" And she blew the whistle three times, issuing a bright sound that rang through the woods. An hour later they heard Bluebeard rustling up the stairs to get his wife and slaughter her. ""Oh God, oh God!"" she cried out. ""Aren't my brothers coming?"" She rushed to the door and locked it, then fearfully stood there holding it shut as well. Bluebeard pounded on the door, crying out that she should open it, and when she did not do so, he tried to break it down. ""Oh sister, oh sister, aren't my brothers coming?"" she said to her sister, who was standing at the window looking out into the distance. She replied, ""I don't see anyone yet."" Meanwhile, Bluebeard was breaking the door apart more and more, and the opening was almost large enough for him to get through, when three knights suddenly appeared before the castle. The sister cried from the window as loudly as she could, ""Help! Help!"" and waved to her brothers. They stormed up the stairs to where they had heard their sister's cry for help. There they saw King Bluebeard, sword in hand, standing before the broken door, and they heard their sister screaming inside the room. Immediately sensing what he was up to, they quickly ran their daggers into his breast and killed him. When the brothers learned what the godless king was going to do to their sister, and that he had already killed so many women, they destroyed his castle, so that there was not one stone remaining on another one. They took with them all his treasures, and lived happily with their sisters in their father's house.",Germany,"Source: Ernst Meier, ""König Blaubart,"" Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Schwaben: Aus dem Munde des Volks gesammelt (Stuttgart: C.

Bluebeard,0312,The Brahman Girl That Married a Tiger,"In a certain village there lived an old Brahman who had three sons and a daughter. The girl being the youngest was brought up most tenderly and become spoilt, and so whenever she saw a beautiful boy she would say to her parents that she must be wedded to him. Her parents were, therefore, much put about to devise excuses for taking her away from her youthful lovers. Thus passed on some years, until the girl was very nearly grown up, and then the parents, fearing that they would be driven out of their caste if they failed to dispose of her hand in marriage before she came to the years of maturity, began to be eager about finding a bridegroom for her. Now near their village there lived a fierce tiger, that had attained to great proficiency in the art of magic, and had the power of assuming different forms. Having a great taste for Brahman's food, the tiger used now and then to frequent temples and other places of public refreshment in the shape of an old famished Brahman in order to share the food prepared for the Brahmans. The tiger also wanted, if possible, a Brahman wife to take to the woods, and there to make her cook his meals after her fashion. One day, when he was partaking of his meals in Brahman shape at a public feeding place, he heard the talk about the Brahman girl who was always falling in love with every beautiful Brahman boy. Said he to himself, ""Praised be the face that I saw first this morning. I shall assume the shape of a Brahman boy, and appear as beautiful as can be, and win the heart of the girl."" Next morning he accordingly assumed the form of a Brahman teacher proficient in the Ramayana near the landing of the sacred river of the village. Scattering holy ashes profusely over his body he opened the Ramayana and began to read. ""The voice of the new teacher is most enchanting. Let us go and hear him,"" said some women among themselves, and sat down before him to hear him expound the great book. The girl for whom the tiger had assumed this shape came in due time to bathe at the river, and as soon as she saw the new teacher fell in love with him, and bothered her old mother to speak to her father about him, so as not to lose her new lover. The old woman too was delighted at the bridegroom whom fortune had thrown in her way, and ran home to her husband, who, when he came and saw the teacher, raised up his hands in praise of the great god Mahesvara. The teacher was now invited to take his meals with them, and as he had come with the express intention of marrying the daughter, he, of course, agreed. A grand dinner followed in honor of the teacher, and his host began to question him as to his parentage, etc., to which the cunning tiger replied that he was born in a village beyond the adjacent wood. The Brahman had no time to wait for further inquiries, and as the boy was very fair he married his daughter to him the very next day. Feasts followed for a month, during which time the bridegroom gave every satisfaction to his new relatives, who supposed him to be human all the while. He also did full justice to the Brahman dishes, and swallowed everything that was placed before him. After the first month was over the tiger bridegroom yearned for his accustomed prey, and hankered after his abode in the woods. A change of diet for a day or two is all very well, but to renounce his own proper food for more than a month was hard. So one day he said to his father-in-law, ""I must go back soon to my old parents, for they will be pining at my absence. But why should we have to bear the double expense of my coming all the way here again to take my wife to my village? So if you will kindly let me take the girl with me I shall take her to her future home, and hand her over to her mother-in-law, and see that she is well taken care of."" The old Brahman agreed to this, and replied, ""My dear son-in-law, you are her husband, and she is yours, and we now send her with you, though it is like sending her into the wilderness with her eyes tied up. But as we take you to be everything to her, we trust you to treat her kindly."" The mother of the bride shed tears at the idea of having to send her away, but nevertheless the very next day was fixed for the journey. The old woman spent the whole day in preparing cakes and sweetmeats for her daughter, and when the time for the journey arrived, she took care to place in her bundles and on her head one or two margosa leaves to keep off demons. The relatives of the bride requested her husband to allow her to rest wherever she found shade, and to eat wherever she found water, and to this he agreed, and so they began their journey. The boy tiger and his human wife pursued their journey for an hour or so in free and pleasant conversation, when the girl happened to see a fine pond, around which the birds were warbling their sweet notes. She requested her husband to follow her to the water's edge and to partake of some of the cakes and sweetmeats with her. But he replied, ""Be quiet, or I shall show you my original shape."" This made her afraid, so she pursued her journey in silence until she saw another pond, when she asked the same question of her husband, who replied in the same tone. Now she was very hungry, and not liking her husband's tone, which she found had greatly changed ever since they had entered the woods, said to him, ""Show me your original shape."" No sooner were these words uttered than her husband's form changed from that of a man. Four legs, striped skin, a long tail, and a tiger's face came over him suddenly and, horror of horrors! a tiger and not a man stood before her! Nor were her fears stilled when the tiger in human voice began as follows: ""Know henceforth that I, your husband, am a tiger -- this very tiger that now speaks to you. If you have any regard for your life you must obey all my orders implicitly, for I can speak to you in human voice, and understand what you say. In an hour or so we shall reach my home, of which you will become the mistress. In the front of my house you will see half a dozen tubs, each of which you must fill up daily with some dish or other, cooked in your own way. I shall take care to supply you with all the provisions you want."" So saying the tiger slowly conducted her to his house. The misery of the girl may more be imagined than described, for if she were to object she would be put to death. So, weeping all the way, she reached her husband's house. Leaving her there he went out and returned with several pumpkins and some flesh, of which she soon prepared a curry and gave it to her husband. He went out again after this and returned in the evening with several vegetables and some more flesh, and gave her an order, ""Every morning I shall go out in search of provisions and prey, and bring something with me on my return; you must keep cooked for me whatever I leave in the house."" So next morning as soon as the tiger had gone away she cooked everything left in the house and filled all the tubs with food. At the fourth hour the tiger returned and growled out, ""I smell a man! I smell a woman in my wood."" And his wife for very fear shut herself up in the house. As soon as the tiger had satisfied his appetite he told her to open the door, which she did, and they talked together for a time, after which the tiger rested awhile, and then went out hunting again. Thus passed many a day, until the tiger's Brahman wife had a son, which also turned out to be only a tiger. One day, after the tiger had gone out to the woods, his wife was crying all alone in the house, when a crow happened to peck at some rice that was scattered near her, and seeing the girl crying, began to shed tears. ""Can you assist me?"" asked the girl. ""Yes,"" said the crow. So she brought out a palmyra leaf and wrote on it with an iron nail all her sufferings in the wood, and requested her brothers to come and relieve her. This palmyra leaf she tied to the neck of the crow, which, seeming to understand her thoughts, flew to her village and sat down before one of her brothers. He untied the leaf and read the contents of the letter and told them to his other brothers. All the three then started for the wood, asking their mother to give them something to eat on the way. She had not enough rice for the three, so she made a big ball of clay and stuck it over with what rice she had, so as to make it look like a ball of rice. This she gave to the brothers to eat on their way, and started them off to the woods. They had not proceeded long before they caught sight of a donkey. The youngest, who was of a playful disposition, wished to take the donkey with him. The two elder brothers objected to this for a time, but in the end they allowed him to have his own way. Further on they saw an ant, which the middle brother took with him. Near the ant there was a big palmyra tree lying on the ground, which the eldest took with him to keep off the tiger. The sun was now high in the horizon and the three brothers became very hungry. So they sat down near a tank and opened the bundle containing the ball of rice. To their utter disappointment they found it to be all clay, but being extremely hungry they drank all the water in the pond and continued their journey. On leaving the tank they found a big iron tub belonging to the washerman of the adjacent village. This they took also with them in addition to the donkey, the ant, and the palmyra tree. Following the road described by their sister in her letter sent by the crow, they walked on and on until they reached the tiger's house. The sister, overjoyed to see her brothers again, ran out at once to welcome them, ""My dearest brothers, I am so glad to see that you have come here to relieve me after all, but the time for the tiger's coming home is approaching, so hide yourselves in the loft, and wait until he is gone."" So saying, she helped her brothers to ascend into the loft. By this time the tiger returned, and perceived the presence of human beings by the peculiar smell. He asked his wife whether anyone had come to their house. She said, ""No."" But when the brothers, who with their trophies of the way -- the donkey, the ant, and so on -- were sitting upon the loft, saw the tiger dallying with their sister, they were greatly frightened; so much so that the youngest, through fear, began to quake, and they all fell on the floor. ""What is all this?"" said the terrified tiger to his wife. ""Nothing,"" said she, ""but your brothers-in-law. They came here three hours ago, and as soon as you have finished your meals they want to see you."" ""How can my brothers-in-law be such cowards?"" thought the tiger to himself. He then asked them to speak to him, whereon the youngest brother put the ant which he had in his hand into the ear of the donkey, and as soon as the latter was bitten, it began to bawl out most horribly. ""How is it that your brothers have such a hoarse voice?"" said the tiger to his wife. He next asked them to show him their legs. Taking courage at the stupidity of the tiger on the two former occasions, the eldest brother now stretched out the palmyra tree. ""By my father, I have never seen such a leg,"" said the tiger, and asked his brothers-in-law to show their bellies. The second brother now showed the tub, at which the tiger shuddered, and saying, ""such a harsh voice, so stout a leg, and such a belly, truly I have never heard of such persons as these!"" He ran away. It was already dark, and the brothers, wishing to take advantage of the tiger's terror, prepared to return home with their sister at once. They ate up what little food she had, and ordered her to start. Fortunately for her, her tiger child was asleep. So she tore it into two pieces and suspended them over the hearth, and, thus getting rid of the child, she ran off with her brothers towards home. Before leaving she bolted the front door from inside, and went out at the back of the house. As soon as the pieces of the cub, which were hung up over the hearth, began to roast, they dripped, which made the fire hiss and sputter; and when the tiger returned at about midnight, he found the door shut and heard the hissing of the fire, which he mistook for the noise of cooking muffins. ""I see,"" said he to himself, ""how very cunning you are; you have bolted the door and are cooking muffins for your brothers. Let us see if we can't get your muffins."" So saying, he went around to the back door and entered his house, and was greatly perplexed to find his cub torn in two and being roasted, his house deserted by his Brahman wife, and his property plundered; for his wife, before leaving, had taken with her as much of the tiger's property as she could conveniently carry. The tiger now discovered all the treachery of his wife, and his heart grieved for the loss of his son, that was now no more. He determined to be revenged on his wife, and to bring her back into the wood, and there tear her into many pieces in place of only two. But how to bring her back? He assumed his original shape of a young bridegroom, making, of course, due allowance for the number of years that had passed since his marriage, and next morning went to his father-in-law's house. His brothers-in-law and his wife saw from a distance the deceitful form he had assumed, and devised means to kill him. The younger ones too ran here and there to bring provisions to feed him sumptuously, and the tiger was highly pleased at the hospitable way in which he was received. There was a ruined well at the back of the house, and the eldest of the brothers placed some thin sticks across its mouth, over which he spread a fine mat. Now it is usual to ask guests to have an oil bath before dinner, and so his three brothers-in-law requested the tiger to take his seat on the fine mat for his bath. As soon as he sat on it, the thin sticks being unable to bear his weight, gave way, and down fell the cunning tiger with a heavy crash! The well was at once filled in with stones and other rubbish, and thus the tiger was effectually prevented from doing any more mischief. But the Brahman girl, in memory of her having married a tiger, raised a pillar over the well and planted a tulasi shrub on the top of it. Morning and evening, for the rest of her life, she used to smear the pillar with sacred cow dung, and water the tulasi shrub. This story is told to explain the Tamil proverb, ""Be quiet, or I shall show you my original shape.""",India,"Source: Mrs. Howard Kingscote and Pandit Natêsá Sástrî, Tales of the Sun; or, Folklore of Southern India (London: W.

Bluebeard,0312,The Little Boy and His Dogs,"Uncle Remus's little patron seemed to be so shocked at the burning of the woman [in the previous story, ""How a Witch Was Caught""] that the old man plunged at once into a curious story about a little boy and his two dogs. One time there was a woman living alongside the big road, and this woman, she had one little boy. It seems to me that he must have been just about your size. He might have been a little broader in the shoulders and a little longer in the legs, yet, take him up one side and down the other, he was just about your shape and size. He was a mighty smart little boy, and his mammy set lots by him. It seems like she had never had any luck except with that boy, because there was a time when she had a little gal, and bless your soul, somebody came along and carried the little gal off, and the little boy didn't have a little sister anymore. This made both of them mighty sorry, but it looked like the little boy was the sorriest, because he showed it the most. Some days he'd take a notion to go and hunt for his little sister, and then he'd go down the big road and climb a big pine tree, and get clear to the top, and look all around to see if he couldn't see his little sister somewhere in the woods. He couldn't see her, but he'd stay up there in the tree and swing in the wind and allow to himself that maybe he might see her by and by. One day while he was sitting up there, he saw two mighty fine ladies walking down the road. He climbed down out of the tree, he did, and ran and told his mammy. The she up an asked, ""How fine are they, honey?"" ""Mighty fine, mammy, mighty fine: puffy-out petticoats and long green veils."" ""How do they look, honey?"" ""Spick-and-span new, mammy."" ""They aren't any of our kin, are they, honey?"" ""That they aren't, mammy. They are mighty fine ladies."" The fine ladies, they came on down the road, they did, and stopped by the woman's house, and begged to please give them some water. The little boy, he ran and fetched them a gourd full, and they put the gourd under their veils and drank, and drank, and drank just like they were nearly perished for water. The little boy watched them. Soon he hollered out, ""Mammy, mammy! What do you reckon? They are lapping the water."" The woman hollered back, ""I reckon that's the way quality folks do, honey."" Then the ladies begged for some bread, and the little boy took them a pone. They ate it like they were mighty nigh famished for bread. By and by the little boy hollered out and said, ""Mammy, mammy! What do you reckon? They've got great long teeth."" The woman, she hollered back, ""I reckon all the quality folks have got them, honey."" Then the ladies asked for some water to wash their hands, and the little boy brought them some. He watched them, and by and by he hollered out, ""Mammy, mammy! What do you reckon? They've got hairy hands and arms."" The woman, she hollered back, ""I reckon all the quality folks have got them, honey."" Then the ladies begged the woman to please let the little boy show them where the big road forks. But the little boy didn't want to go. He hollered out, ""Mammy, folks don't have to be shown where the road forks."" But the woman, she allowed, ""I reckon the quality folks do, honey."" The little boy, he began to whimper and cry, because he didn't want to go with the ladies, but the woman said he ought to be ashamed of himself for going on that way in front of the quality folks, and more than that, he might run into his little sister and fetch her home. Now this here little boy had two mighty bad dogs. One of them was named Minnyminny Morack, and the other one was named Follerlinsko, and they were so bad that they had to be tied in the yard day and night, except when they were a-hunting. So the little boy, he went and got a pan of water and set in down in the middle of the floor, and then he went and got himself a willow limb, and he stuck it in the ground. Then he allowed, ""Mammy, when the water in this here pan turns to blood, then you run out and set loose Minnyminny Morack and Follerlinsko, and when you see that there willow limb a-shaking, you run and sick them on my track."" The woman, she up and said, she'd turn the dogs loose, and then the little boy, he stuck his hands in his pockets and went on down the road a-whistling, just the same as any other little boy, except that he was a lot smarter. He went on down the road, he did, and the fine quality ladies, they came on behind. The further he went the faster he walked. This made the quality ladies walk fast too, and it wasn't so mighty long before the little boy heard them making a mighty curious fuss, and when he turned around, bless gracious! they were a-panting, because they were so tired and hot. The little boy allowed to himself that it was mighty curious how ladies could pant the same as a wild varmint, but he said he expected that was the way quality ladies do when they get hot and tired, and he made like he couldn't hear them, because he wanted to be nice and polite. After a while, when the quality ladies thought the little boy wasn't looking at them, he saw one of them drop down on her all fours and trot along just like a varmint, and it wasn't long before the other one dropped down on her all fours. Then the little boy allowed, ""Shoo! If that is the way quality ladies rest themselves when they get tired, I reckon a little chap about my size had better be fixing to rest himself."" So he looked around, he did, and he took and picked himself out a great big pine tree by the side of the road, and began to climb it. Then, when they saw that, one of the quality ladies allowed, ""My goodness! What in the world are you up to now?"" The little boy, he said, ""I'm just a-climbing a tree to rest my bones."" The ladies, they allowed, ""Why don't you rest them on the ground?"" The little boy, he said, ""Because I want to get up where it is cool and high."" The quality ladies, they took and walked around and around the tree like they were measuring it to see how big it was. By and by, after a while, they said, ""Little boy, little boy! You'd better come down from there and show us the way to the forks of the road."" Then the little boy allowed, ""Just keep right on, ladies. You'll find the forks of the road. You can't miss them. I'm afraid to come down, because I might fall and hurt one of you all."" The ladies, they said, ""You'd better come down before we run and tell your mammy how bad your are."" The little boy allowed, ""While you are telling her, please tell her how scared I am."" The quality ladies got mighty mad. They walked around that tree and fairly snorted. They pulled off their bonnets, and their veils, and their dresses, and, lo and behold, the little boy saw that they were two great big panthers. They had great big eyes, and big sharp teeth, and great long tails, and they looked up at the little boy and growled and grinned at him until he mighty nigh had a chill. They tried to climb the tree, but they had trimmed their claws so they could get gloves on, and they couldn't climb any more. Then one of them sat down in the road and made a curious mark in the sand, and their great long tales turned into axes, and no sooner did the tails turn into axes than they began to cut the tree down. I don't dare tell you how sharp those axes were, because you wouldn't nigh believe me. One of them stood on one side of the tree, and the other one stood on the other side, and they whacked at that tree like they were taking a holiday. They whacked out chips as big as your hat, and it wasn't so mighty long before the tree was ready to fall. But while the little boy was sitting up there, scared mighty nigh to death, it came into his mind that he had some eggs in his pocket that he had brought with him to eat whenever he got hungry. He took out one of the eggs and broke it, and said, ""Place fill up!"" And bless your soul, the place sure enough filled up, and the tree looked just exactly like nobody had been a-cutting on it. But them there panthers, they were very vigorous. They just spit on their hands and cut away. When they got the tree mighty nigh cut down, the little boy, he pulled out another egg and broke it, and said, ""Place, fill up!"" And by the time he said it, the tree was done made sound again. They kept on this a-way until the little boy began to get scared again. He had broken all his eggs except one, and them there creatures were a-cutting away like they were venomous, which they most surely were. Just about that time the little boy's mammy happened to stumble over the pan of water that was sitting down on the floor, and there it was, all turned to blood. Then she ran and unloosed Minnyminny Morack and Follerlinsko. Then when she did that she saw the willow limb a-shaking, and then she put the dogs on the little boy's track, and away they went. The little boy heard them a-coming, and he hollered out, ""Come on, my good dogs. Here, dogs, here."" The panthers, they stopped chopping and listened. One asked the other one what she could hear. The little boy said, ""You don't hear anything. Go on with your chopping."" The panthers, they chopped some more, and then they thought they heard the dogs a-coming. Then they tried their best to get away, but it wasn't any use. They didn't have time to change their axes back into tails, and because they couldn't run with axes dragging behind them, the dogs caught them. The little boy, he allowed, ""Shake them and bite them. Drag them around and around, until you drag them two miles."" So the dogs dragged them around for two miles. Then the little boy said, ""Shake them and tear them. Drag them around and around, until you drag them ten miles."" They dragged them ten miles, and by the time they got back, the panthers were cold and stiff. Then the little boy climbed down out of the tree and sat down to rest himself. By and by, after a while, he allowed to himself that beings he was having so much fun, he believed he'd take his dogs and go way off into the woods to see if he couldn't find his little sister. He called his dogs, he did, and went off into the woods, and they hadn't gone so mighty far before he saw a house in the woods away off by itself. The dogs, they went up and smelled around, they did, and came back with their bristles up, but the little boy allowed he'd go up there anyhow and see what the dogs were mad about. So he called the dogs and went towards the house, and when he got close up he saw a little gal toting wood and water. She was a might pretty little gal, because she had milk-white skin and great long yellow hair, but her clothes were all in rags, and she was crying because she had to work so hard. Minnyminny Morack and Follerlinsko wagged their tales when they saw the little gal, and the little boy knew by that that she was his sister. So he went up and asked her what her name was, and she said she didn't know what her name was, because she was so scared she forgot. Then he asked her what in the name of goodness she was crying about, and she said she was crying because she had to work so hard. Then he asked her who the house belonged to, and she allowed it belonged to a great big old black bear, and this old bear made her tote wood and water all the time. She said the water was to go into the big wash-pot, and the wood was to make the pot boil, and the pot was to cook folks that the great big old bear brought home to his children. The little boy didn't tell the little gal that he was her brother, but he allowed that he was going to stay and eat supper with the big old bear. The little gal cried and allowed he'd better not, but the little boy said he wasn't afraid to eat supper with a bear. So they went into the house, and when the little boy got in there, he saw that the bear had two great big children, and one of them was squatting on the bed, and the other one was squatting down in the hearth. The children were both named Cubs for short, but the little boy wasn't scared of them, because there were his dogs to do away with them if they so much as rolled an eyeball. The old bear was a mighty long time coming back, so the little gal, she up and fixed supper anyhow, and the little boy, he scrounged from Cubs first on one side and then on the other, and he and the little gal got as much as they wanted. After supper the little boy told the little gal that he'd take and comb her hair just to while away the time. But the little gal's hair hadn't been combed for so long, and it was in such a tangle, that it made the poor creature cry to hear anybody talking about combing it. Then the little boy allowed he wasn't going to hurt her, and he took and warmed some water in a pan and put it on her hair, and then he combed and curled it, just as nice you ever did see. When the old bear got home he was mighty taken back when he saw he had company, and when he saw them all sitting down like they had come to stay. But he was mighty polite, and he shook hands all around, and sat down by the fire and dried his boots, and asked about the crops, and allowed that the weather would be monstrous fine if they could get a little season of rain. Then he took and made a great admiration over the little gal's hair, and he asked the little boy how in the whole world he could curl it and fix it so nice. The little one allowed it was easy enough. Then the old bear said he believed he would like to get his hair curled up that way, and the little boy said, ""Fill the big pot with water."" The old bear filled the pot with water. Then the little boy said, ""Build a fire under the pot and heat the water hot."" When the water got scalding hot, the little boy said, ""All ready now. Stick your head in. It's the only way to make your hair curl."" Then the old bear stuck his head in the water, and that was the last of him, bless gracious! The scalding water curled the hair until it came off, and I suspect that is where they got the idea about putting bear grease on folks's hair. The young bears, they cried like everything when they saw how their daddy had been treated, and they wanted to bite and scratch the little boy and his sister, but those dogs -- Minnyminny Morack and Follerlinsko -- they just laid hold of them there bears, and there wasn't enough left of them to feed a kitten. ""What did they do then?"" asked the little boy who had been listening to the story. The old man took off his spectacles and cleaned the glasses on his coattail. ""Well, sir,"" he went on, ""the little boy took and carried his sister home, and his mammy said that she never again would set any store by folks with fine clothes, because they were so deceitful. No, never, so long as the Lord might spare her. And then after that they lived together right straight along, and if it hadn't been for the war, they'd be a-living there now. Because war is a mighty dangerous business.""","African American, Joel Chandler Harris","Source: Joel Chandler Harris, Daddy Jake, the Runaway; and, Short Stories Told After Dark by ""Uncle Remus"" (New York: The Century Company, 1896), pp. 93-107. © 1889 by Joel Chandler Harris.",The episode describing the boy's rescue of his sister bears a strong resemblance to tales of types 312 and 312A.

The Boy Who Had Never Seen a Woman,1678,Filippo Balducci and His Son,"When Filippo Balducci lost his wife to death, he resolved to devote himself and his young son to God. Consequently he gave his worldly possessions to charity, then took his little son to the slopes of Mount Asinaio, where they lived together in a cave, completely secluded from the ways and temptations of the world. In this remote sanctuary, Filippo taught his son about God and the saints, protecting him always from distractions and sin. Only after the boy reached the age of eighteen did the father feel it safe to expose him to the outside world. ""Surely,"" thought Filippo, ""his years of devotion and prayer in this place of solitude will now defend him against the ways of the world."" And the two of them, father and son, set off for the city of Florence. Everything was new and amazing for the son: houses, palaces, churches, horses, and people. Filled with amazement, he asked his father about every unfamiliar thing, and Filippo dutifully provided names and explanations for all that they saw, that is, until they happened upon a party of beautiful young women. The boy, who until now had never beheld such a sight, could not take his eyes from them. ""Do not look at them,"" warned Filippo. ""But what are they?"" asked the son. ""Oh, they are just geese,"" replied Filippo, wanting to divert the boy's attention from the young women. ""Please, father,"" begged the boy, ""let me have one of those geese. I could put something into its bill. ""No!"" exclaimed the father. ""Their bills are not where you think they are, and they require special feeding. And furthermore they are evil!""

When she had reached the topmost branch, she suddenly cried out, ""O thou shameless man, what abominable action is this!

Now she loved him with an exceeding love and could not brook his separation an hour nor could endure to vex him; so, when she heard his words, she said to him, ""[So be it,] in God's name, O my beloved and solace of mine eyes, may he not live who would vex thee!""

Then said she to her husband, ""I desire to mount this tree."" And he said, ""Do so."" So she climbed up and when she came to the top of the tree, she cried out and buffeted her face, saying, ""Lewd fellow that thou art, are these thy usages? Thou sworest [fidelity to me] and liedst.""

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Merchant's Tale,"In the town of Pavia in Lombardy there lived a worthy knight by the name of January. Although throughout his long and prosperous life he had partaken often of the fruits of love, he felt no need for marriage until he passed his sixtieth year, when suddenly he was overcome by a violent urge to become a wedded man. ""A young and beautiful wife,"" he concluded, ""would be the fulfillment of my wealth and glory. Obedient, loyal, and untiring, she would attend to my every need in my waning years, and further, she may well present me with an heir."" ""Not so!"" argued some. ""A wife's interest will be more toward your fortune than toward your well being, and further, her unbridled passions may place your honor at risk."" But January listened not to these negative voices, paying heed instead to those who praised the virtues of womanhood and the benefits of marriage. And thus he soon announced to his friends his resolve to find a bride, ""But,"" he asserted, ""she must be under twenty years of age, for young veal is tastier than old beef."" His friends tried to dissuade him from this resolve, but to no avail, and at last -- driven onward by unrelenting fantasies -- he found the woman who satisfied his dreams. Although not of high rank, she was young and beautiful, and, in his love-blinded perception, she was also compliant and self-disciplined. Further, like old January himself, she too bore the name of a season: May. Marriage documents were executed, the holy sacrament of marriage was duly performed, and the priest united January and May as husband and wife. One wedding guest was particularly moved, a robust young man named Damian, who served as a squire to Knight January. Ravished by May's fresh beauty, the squire fell madly in love with his master's young bride. No one knows what young May was thinking in her heart as old January -- with his beard of stubble and loose skin shaking about his throat -- labored in the field of love. But Damian's thoughts were not entirely secret. He poured out his soul with pen and ink, then managed to slip the letter into the hand of his beloved May without being seen by the ever-watchful January. May's only opportunity to read the letter came in that small place where everyone goes alone. There she committed Damian's message to memory, then tore the letter into pieces and threw them into the privy. But one thing is certain. She took no offense at the young squire's forwardness, for as soon as she could steal a few minutes' time, she composed a letter to the young squire, promising him the satisfaction he desired of her as soon as the time and place might present themselves. In the meantime old January's fortune turned against him, and he lost his sight. The curse of blindness increased the knight's possessiveness and jealousy toward his young wife. Fearing that she might succumb to some temptation under the cover of his darkness, he never let her go out unless he himself had her by the hand. Nevertheless, by using private hand signals and smuggled letters, she communicated her forbidden love to Damian, and invented a plan whereby it might be consummated. The tryst was to take place in a private garden where January and May often walked together. Following his beloved's plan, Damian let himself into the garden at the appointed time, then hid himself in the branches of a pear tree that grew there. A little later January and May, hand in hand, approached the tree, when May suddenly declared an intense appetite for a pear from the nearby tree. ""Do let me climb the tree and pluck a pear,"" she begged of her husband. Then recalling his blind jealousy, she added, ""You can hold your arms around the tree to make sure that I am alone."" Not wanting to deny her this innocent request, he stooped over and let her step onto his back. Taking hold of a branch, she pulled herself into tree and into the arms of the waiting Damian. Now ladies, please take no offence, but I must tell the story as it actually happened. Damian forthwith lifted her smock and thrust away, with the deceived husband blindly hugging the tree beneath them. However, this shameful tryst was not entirely unseen. The king and queen of Fairyland saw all, and the king -- horrified at the cuckoldry -- resolved at once to restore the old knight's sight immediately and thus expose his wife's and his squire's faithlessness. ""Do that!"" replied the fairy king's wife. ""But nothing bad will come to the young woman, for I will give her a bold and quick answer that will excuse her and her lover from all guilt."" And thus it happened. As granted by the fairy king, sight miraculously returned to January's aging eyes. But his rejoicing was short lived, for looking up, the first thing he saw was his wife engaged in an act that polite words cannot describe. ""Strumpet!"" he called out angrily. ""What are you up to?"" Now it was the fairy queen's turn to ply her magic, and -- as promised -- she put a quick response onto the wayward wife's tongue. ""Sir,"" replied May, ""have patience. Don't you see what I have done? I was told that the only cure for your blindness would be for me to struggle with a man upon a tree."" ""Struggle?"" said he. ""It went right in!"" ""Oh no!"" said she. ""You caught a hazy glimpse, my good sir, but your sight is still poor. Things are not as they first appeared to you."" Then she continued, ""This slander is my reward for helping you to see."" ""Never mind!"" said he. ""Come down. But it did appear to me that Damian was enjoying you with your smock upon his breast."" ""Think what you will,"" said she, ""but it was only a false vision following your long blindness.""

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Story of Lydia and Pyrrhus,"Nicostratus, a wealthy patrician, married Lydia, a woman of great distinction and unsurpassed beauty. He was well advanced in years, while she was still a paragon of youth and vitality. Consequently, to state the matter delicately, their marriage did not leave the young wife entirely satisfied. Thus, it is quite understandable that Lydia found herself paying ever more attention to one of her husband's servants, Pyrrhus by name, who was elegant, handsome, young, and energetic. He was attracted to her as well, and gladly would have accepted her invitations to love, but the old man gave them no opportunity. What he lacked in vigor he made up with jealousy and perseverance, rarely leaving his beautiful young wife alone. Their unrequited passion aglow, Lydia and Pyrrhus devised a daring scheme through which, even in the master's presence, they might satisfy their longing for one another. Accordingly, one day when the three were walking in the garden, as they often did, Lydia requested a pear from a certain tree. Pyrrhus climbed after the fruit, but once in the tree, he called to his master, ""Have you no shame, making love like that in broad daylight?"" The master demanded an explanation for the strange remark, and Pyrrhus concluded that the pear tree was enchanted, giving the impression of unreal happenings below. To test the theory, he asked his master to climb the tree, and see if he too would behold impossible things below. His curiosity piqued, Nicostratus mustered enough strength to climb onto one of the pear tree's lower branches. Looking down, what did he behold but Pyrrhus and Lydia making fervent love. From his precarious perch, he shouted curses, threats, and insults at them. but they -- engaged with other pursuits -- quite ignored him. Nicostratus climbed down from the tree, only to find Pyrrhus and Lydia seated discretely on a garden bench. Their innocent demeanor convinced him that nothing unseemly had happened. Fearing that only a bedeviled tree could be responsible for the vile images that he had perceived, he sent for an ax and had it cut down immediately. From that time forth Nicostratus relaxed his watchful vigil over his young wife, and thus Pyrrhus and Lydia were able to pluck the fruits of their love at regular intervals, even without the help of their enchanted pear tree.",Giovanni Boccaccio,"Source: Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron, day 7, tale 9.

Half an hour afterward the woman climbed up the tree and turned and looked down and began, ""May you be struck blind! May God punish you! Man, what are you doing? Is there anyone who has ever done such a thing? You are making merry with a strange woman under the eyes of your wife. Quick, divorce me!"" And she cried out. Her husband said, ""What is with you, woman? Have you gone mad? There is no one with me."" Said the woman, ""Be silent, you unblushing and shameless fellow. The woman is with you, and you deny it."" Her husband said, ""Come down."" She replied, ""I will not come down so long as that woman is with you."" Her husband began to swear, protesting, and the woman came down and said to him, ""Where is that harlot? Quick, show her to me, or else!"" Again the man swore, and the woman said, ""Can it then be the work of the sweetmeat?"" The man said, ""May be."" Said the woman, ""You too go up and look down on me, and let us see."" Her husband took hold of the tree, and while he was climbing, the woman made a sign to her lover. The man looked down and saw the woman making merry with a youth. This time the man cried out, ""Away with you! What is with you, you shameless boy?"" The woman said, ""You are lying."" But the man could not endure it and began to come down, and the youth ran off. .",Turkey,"Source: Sheykh-Zada, The History of the Forty Vezirs; or, The Story of the Forty Morns and Eves, translated by E.

""I will let you know what I mean,"" he answered, ""if you will just wait till I come down."" So she promised to wait till he came down from the tree, and meanwhile sent her lover away. At last her husband reached the ground. ""It is of no use your making excuses,"" he said. ""You have been caught in flagranti delicto.""

He had raised him since childhood, and the old monk now wanted put the young one to a test. Arriving in the city, they saw a number of women walking to and fro. Filled with amazement, the young monk stared at them with calf's eyes. Until now he had never seen a woman, for since his earliest childhood he had been raised in a monastery. He asked the old monk what these things were. The old monk answered, saying, ""They are geese."" The women were wearing white veils and white cloaks. The young monk left good enough alone and said nothing more. Afterward, when the two were back at their monastery, the young monk began to cry bitterly. The old monk asked him why he was crying.

The Boy Who Had Never Seen a Woman,1678,Filippo Balducci and His Son,"When Filippo Balducci lost his wife to death, he resolved to devote himself and his young son to God. Consequently he gave his worldly possessions to charity, then took his little son to the slopes of Mount Asinaio, where they lived together in a cave, completely secluded from the ways and temptations of the world. In this remote sanctuary, Filippo taught his son about God and the saints, protecting him always from distractions and sin. Only after the boy reached the age of eighteen did the father feel it safe to expose him to the outside world. ""Surely,"" thought Filippo, ""his years of devotion and prayer in this place of solitude will now defend him against the ways of the world."" And the two of them, father and son, set off for the city of Florence. Everything was new and amazing for the son: houses, palaces, churches, horses, and people. Filled with amazement, he asked his father about every unfamiliar thing, and Filippo dutifully provided names and explanations for all that they saw, that is, until they happened upon a party of beautiful young women. The boy, who until now had never beheld such a sight, could not take his eyes from them. ""Do not look at them,"" warned Filippo. ""But what are they?"" asked the son. ""Oh, they are just geese,"" replied Filippo, wanting to divert the boy's attention from the young women. ""Please, father,"" begged the boy, ""let me have one of those geese. I could put something into its bill. ""No!"" exclaimed the father. ""Their bills are not where you think they are, and they require special feeding. And furthermore they are evil!"" Poor Filippo now regretted having taken his son from his protective sanctuary, for even as he spoke, he realized that however clever his responses were, they were no match for the boy's natural inclinations.",Giovanni Boccaccio,"Source: Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron, day 4, introduction.

""Well thought of,"" said the others; ""we will go there."" After walking a league, they heard a voice crying: ""Bah, bah."" They saw a great sheep, and were afraid, and ran away, saying: ""Fly, fly, it is going to attack us."" But the sheep cried to them: ""Don't be afraid. Where are you going?"" ""To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil,"" they answered. ""Would you like me to go too?"" said the sheep. ""Oh, yes,"" they replied. They went another league, and heard a voice that said: ""Mieaou, mieaou."" And they saw a very great black cat, and were frightened, and ran away, saying: ""Fly, fly, it is going to scratch us."" But the cat cried to them: ""Don't be frightened, I won't scratch you. Where are you going?"" ""To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil,"" they replied. ""Would you like me to go too?"" ""Oh, do come,"" answered the kids. They went a league farther, and heard a voice crowing: ""Cock-a-doodle-doo."" And the saw a very fiery cock, and were frightened, and fled, saying: ""Fly, fly, it is going to peck us."" The cock said to them: ""Don't be afraid, I won't peck you. Where are you going?"" ""To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil."" ""Would you like me to go?"" ""By all means,"" replied the kids. They went another league, and saw a packing needle, and were frightened, and ran away, saying: ""Fly, fly, It will prick us."" But the needle said: ""Don't be afraid, I won't prick you. Where are you going?"" ""To Benibaire's house, to steal three flasks of oil."" ""Would you like me to go?"" ""Yes, come along."" They went another league, and arrived at Benibaire's house; and as it was night, the door was closed. ""How shall we get in?"" said the little kids. To which the cock replied: ""I will fly on to the roof, and get down the chimney."" And he did so, and opened the door to them all. They entered the house, and said, ""Where shall we hide ourselves?"" The cock replied: ""I have my place already; I will go into the chimney."" The cat hid in the cinders; the needle put itself into the towel, and the sheep got behind the door. Then the kids went to the jars to draw the oil. Whilst they were drawing it they let the funnel fall, and this aroused Benibaire, who said: ""Oh, Lord! thieves have got into my house."" He got up and went to the chimney, and looked up the flue, to see if it were day. Whilst he was looking up, the cock dropped some lime into his eyes and blinded him. He ran to the towel to wipe his face, and as the needle was there, it pricked him; he went to kindle a fire by the eye of the cat in the ashes, and she darted out at him and scratched him; he went flying to the door, and when he got there the sheep gave him a push and he rolled into the street; he went to the mill, and fell into the river, and was drowned, and the three kids remained masters of the house, and had a very good time of it.",Spain,"Source: Fernan Caballero [Cecilia Francisca J.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,How Jack Went to Seek His Fortune,"Once on a time there was a boy named Jack, and one morning he started to go and seek his fortune. He hadn't gone very far before he met a cat. ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the cat. ""I am going to seek my fortune."" ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little further and they met a dog. ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the dog. ""I am going to seek my fortune."" ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little further and they met a goat, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the goat. ""I am going to seek my fortune."" ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little further and they met a bull. ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the bull. ""I am going to seek my fortune."" ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little further and they met a skunk. ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the skunk. ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. They went a little further and they met a rooster. ""Where are you going, Jack?"" said the rooster. ""I am going to seek my fortune."" ""May I go with you?"" ""Yes,"" said Jack, ""the more the merrier."" So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. Well, they went on till it was about dark, and they began to think of some place where they could spend the night. About this time they came in sight of a house, and Jack told them to keep still while he went up a looked in through the window. And there were some robbers counting over their money. Then Jack went back and told them to wait till he gave the word, and then to make all the noise they could. So when they were all ready Jack gave the word, and the cat mewed, and the dog barked, and the goat blatted, and the bull bellowed, and the rooster crowed, and all together they made such a dreadful noise that it frightened the robbers all away. And then they went in a took possession of the house. Jack was afraid the robbers would come back in the night, and so when it came time to go to bed he put the cat in the rocking-chair, and he put the dog under the table, and he put the goat upstairs, and he put the bull down cellar, and he put the skunk in the corner of the fireplace, and the rooster flew up onto the roof, and Jack went to bed. By and by the robbers saw it was all dark, and they sent one man back to the house to look after their money. Before long he came back in a great fright and told them his story. ""I went back to the house,"" said he, ""and went in an tried to sit down in the rocking-chair, and there was an old woman knitting, and she stuck her knitting needles into me. I went to the table to look after the money, and there was a shoemaker under the table, and he stuck his awl into me. I started to go upstairs, and there was a man up there threshing, and he knocked me down with his flail. I started to go down cellar, and there was a man down there chopping wood, and he knocked me up with his axe. I went to warm me at the fireplace, and there was an old woman washing dishes, and she threw her dishwater onto me. But I shouldn't have minded all that if it hadn't been for that little fellow on top of the house, who kept a hollering, 'Toss him up to me-e! Toss him up to me-e!'"" Once on a time there was a boy named Jack, who set out to seek his fortune. He had not gone but a little way when he came to a horse. The horse said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" He said, ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, guess I will."" So they walked along together. By and by they came to a cow. The cow said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" He said, ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, guess I will."" So they walked along together. By and by they came to a ram. The ram said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" He said, ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, guess I will."" So they walked along together. By and by they came to a dog. The dog said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, guess I will."" So they all walked along together. By and by they came to a cat. The cat said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" He said, ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, guess I will."" So they all walked along together. By and by they came to a rooster. The rooster said, ""Where are you going, Jack?"" ""I'm going to seek my fortune. Won't you go along too?"" ""Don't know, don't care if I do."" So they all walked along together. They traveled along until it began to grow dark, and then they were looking for a place to spend the night, when they saw a log cabin in the edge of a woods. Jack went up to the house and found the door unlocked, and went in. After looking about he found a good bed upstairs and plenty of good food in the cupboard. There was a fire on the hearth. As he could see no one living there, after he had eaten a good supper and fed all the animals, he began to make preparations for the night. First he led the horse out into the stable, and fed him some hay, for he found plenty of good hay on the mow. Then he took all the other animals into the house, and he found the door closed into the locker, so he stationed the dog under the table near the door, so that he mighty bite anyone who might chance to enter the house. The cat lay down on the hearth, and the rooster perched on a large crossbeam, and then he stationed the cow at the foot of the stairs, and the ram at the top of the stairs that led to the loft. Then he covered up the fire, put out the light, and went to bed, and was soon fast asleep. Now it happened that this valley was the home of two wicked robbers, who had gone out during the day in search of plunder. Late in the night Jack was awakened by a great noise, for the robbers had returned and opened the door, expecting to find things as usual. They were suddenly grabbed by the dog, who bit them furiously, barking all the while. At last they managed to escape from him, and started to the fireplace, thinking to strike a light. One of the robbers tried to light a match by a coal which he thought he saw shining in the ashes; but this was the cat's eye, and as soon as she was molested she flew on them and scratched their faces dreadfully, till they were glad to escape from the fireplace. They went from the fireplace toward the stairs, but as they passed under the rooster's perch he dropped very disagreeable material (these words to be whispered) upon them. The robbers groped their way through the dark to the foot of the stairs, meaning to creep up to the bed and rest till morning, but just as they reached the stairs they were suddenly caught on the horns of the cow, and tossed up in the air. The ram called out, ""Toss 'em up to me!"" Before they lighted he caught them on his horns and tossed them up in the air. And the cow called out, ""Toss 'em down to me!"" Before they lighted she caught them on her horns and tossed them up in the air. Then the ram called out, ""Toss 'em up to me!"" And before they lighted he caught them on his horns, etc. (to be repeated ad libitum). And so they tossed them back and forth until they were all mangled and bloody. At last they managed to escape from the cow's horns, and thought they would crawl off to the barn and spend the rest of the night. As they passed the dog in going to the door he gave them a parting snip, but they escaped from him and found the way out to the barn. When they tried to creep in at the door the horse began to kick them so dreadfully that they had to give that up, and were only just able to creep off to a fence corner, where they laid down and died. As soon as Jack found that everything was quiet he went to sleep, and slept soundly till morn, after he got up and dressed himself. By and by he looked about and found there was a large bag of gold under his bed, which had been stolen from time to time by the robbers. So Jack kept the gold, was well provided for, and lived happily forever after with his faithful animals.",USA USA,"Source: Journal of American Folk-Lore, vol. 1 (1888), pp. 227-28.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,Jack and His Comrades,"So Jack said to his mother one evening, ""Mother, bake my cake, and kill my cock, till I go seek my fortune; and if I meet it, never fear but I'll soon be back to share it with you."" So she did as he asked her, and he set out at break of day on his journey. His mother came along with him to the bawn (yard) gate, and says she, ""Jack, which would you rather have, half the cake and half the cock with my blessing, or the whole of 'em with my curse?"" ""O musha, mother,"" says Jack, ""why do you ax me that question? Sure you know I wouldn't have your curse and Damer's estate along with it."" ""Well, then, Jack,"" says she, ""here's the whole tote (lot) of 'em, and my thousand blessings along with them."" So she stood on the bawn ditch (fence) and blessed him as far as her eyes could see him. Well, he went along and along till he was tired, and ne'er a farmer's house he went into wanted a boy. At last his road led by the side of a bog, and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near a big bunch of grass he was striving to come at. ""Ah, then, Jack asthore,"" says he, ""help me out or I'll be dhrownded."" ""Never say't twice,"" says Jack, and he pitched in big stones and scraws (sods) into the slob, till the ass got good ground under him. ""Thank you, Jack,"" says he, when he was out on the hard road; ""I'll do as much for you another time. Where are you going?"" ""Faith, I'm going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in, God bless it!"" ""And if you like,"" says the ass, ""I'll go along with you; who knows what luck we may have!"" ""With all my heart; it's getting late, let us be jogging."" Well, they were going through a village, and a whole army of gorsoons [garçons] were hunting a poor dog with a kittle tied to his tail. He ran up to Jack for protection, and the ass let such a roar out of him, that the little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy (the devil) was after them. ""More power to you, Jack!"" says the dog. ""I'm much obleeged to you; where is the baste and yourself going?"" ""We're going to seek our fortune till harvest comes in."" ""And wouldn't I be proud to go with you!"" says the dog, ""and get shut (rid) of them ill conducted boys; purshuin' to 'em!"" ""Well, well, throw your tail over your arm, and come along."" They got outside the town, and sat down under an old wall, and Jack pulled out his bread and meat, and shared with the dog; and the ass made his dinner on a bunch of thistles. While they were eating and chatting, what should come by but a poor half-starved cat, and the moll-row he gave out of him would make your heart ache. ""You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast,"" says Jack; ""here's a bone and something on it."" ""May your child never know a hungry belly!"" says Tom; ""it's myself that's in need of your kindness. May I be so bold as to ask where yez are all going?"" ""We're going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in, and you may join us if you like."" ""And that I'll do with a heart and a half,"" says the cat, "" and thank'ee for asking me."" Off they set again, and just as the shadows of the trees were three times as long as themselves, they heard a great cackling in a field inside the road, and out over the ditch jumped a fox with a fine black cock in his mouth. ""Oh you anointed villian!"" says the ass, roaring like thunder. ""At him, good dog!"" says Jack, and the word wasn't out of his mouth when Coley was in full sweep after the Moddhera Rua (Red Dog). Reynard dropped his prize like a hot potato, and was off like shot, and the poor cock came back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades. ""O musha, naybours!"" says he, ""wasn't it the hoith o' luck that threw you in my way! Maybe I won't remember your kindness if ever I find you in hardship; and where in the world are you all going?"" ""We're going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in; you may join our party if you like, and sit on Neddy's crupper when your legs and wings are tired."" Well, the march began again, and just as the sun was gone down they looked around, and there was neither cabin nor farm house in sight. ""Well, well,"" says Jack, ""the worse luck now the better another time, and it's only a summer night after all. We'll go into the wood, and make our bed on the long grass."" No sooner said than done. Jack stretched himself on a bunch of dry grass, the ass lay near him, the dog and cat lay in the ass's warm lap, and the cock went to roost in the next tree. Well, the soundness of deep sleep was over them all, when the cock took a notion of crowing. ""Bother you, Cuileach Dhu (Black Cock)!"" says the ass; ""you disturbed me from as nice a wisp of hay as ever I tasted. What's the matter?"" ""It's daybreak that's the matter; don't you see light yonder?"" ""I see a light indeed,"" says Jack, ""but it's from a candle it's coming, and not from the sun. As you've roused us we may as well go over, and ask for lodging."" So they all shook themselves, and went on through grass, and rocks, and briars, till they got down into a hollow, and there was the light coming through the shadow, and along with it came singing, and laughing, and cursing. ""Easy, boys!"" says Jack; ""walk on your tippy toes till we see what sort of people we have to deal with."" So they crept near the window, and there they saw six robbers inside, with pistols, and blunderbushes, and cutlashes, sitting at a table, eating roast beef and pork, and drinking mulled beer, and wine, and whisky punch. ""Wasn't that a fine haul we made at the Lord of Dunlavin's!"" says one ugly-looking thief with his mouth full, ""and it's little we'd get only for the honest porter; here's his purty health!"" ""The porter's purty health!"" cried out every one of them, and Jack bent his finger at his comrades. ""Close your ranks, my men,"" says he in a whisper, ""and let every one mind the word of command."" So the ass put his fore-hoofs on the sill of the window, the dog got on the ass's head, the cat got on the dog's head, and the cock on the cat's head. Then Jack made a sign, and they all sung out like mad. ""Hee haw, hee-haw!"" roared the ass; ""bow-wow!"" barked the dog; ""meaw-meaw!"" cried the cat; ""cock-a-doodle-doo!"" crowed the cock. ""Level your pistols!"" cried Jack, ""and make smithereens of 'em. Don't leave a mother's son of 'em alive; present, fire!"" With that they gave another halloo, and smashed every pane in the window. The robbers were frightened out of their lives. They blew out the candles, threw down the table, and skelped out at the back door as if they were in earnest, and never drew rein till they were in the very heart of the wood. Jack and his party got into the room, closed the shutters, lighted the candles, and ate and drank till hunger and thirst were gone. Then they lay down to rest -- Jack in the bed, the ass in the stable, the dog on the door mat, the cat by the fire, and the cock on the perch. At first the robbers were very glad to find themselves safe in the thick wood, but they soon began to get vexed. ""This damp grass is very different from our warm room,"" says one; ""I was obliged to drop a fine pig's crubeen (foot),"" says another; "" I didn't get a foy-spoonful of my last tumbler,"" says another; ""and all the Lord of Dunlavin's goold and silver that we left behind!"" says the last. ""I think I'll venture back,"" says the captain, ""and see if we can recover anything."" ""That's a good boy!"" said they all, and away he went. The lights were all out, and so he groped his way to the fire, and there the cat flew in his face, and tore him with teeth and claws. He let a roar out of him, and made for the room door, to look for a candle inside. He trod on the dog's tail, and if he did, he got the marks of his teeth in his arms, and legs, and thighs. ""Millia murdher (thousand murders)!"" cried he; ""I wish I was out of this unlucky house."" When he got to the street door, the cock dropped down upon him with his claws and bill, and what the cat and dog done to him was only a flay-bite to what he got from the cock. ""Oh, tattheration to you all, you unfeeling vagabones!"" says he, when he recovered his breath; and he staggered and spun round and round till he reeled into the stable, back foremost, but the ass received him with a kick on the broadest part of his small clothes, and laid him comfortably on the dunghill. When he came to himself, he scratched his head, and began to think what happened him; and as soon as he found that his legs were able to carry him, he crawled away, dragging one foot after another, till he reached the wood. ""Well, well,"" cried them all, when he came within hearing, ""any chance of our property?"" ""You may say chance,"" says he, ""and it's itself is the poor chance all out. Ah, will any of you pull a bed of dry grass for me? All the sticking-plaster in Inniscorfy (Enniscorthy) will be too little for the cuts and bruises I have on me. Ah, if you only knew what I have gone through for you! When I got to the kitchen fire, looking for a sod of lighted turf, what should be there but a colliach (old woman) carding flax, and you may see the marks she left on my face with the cards. I made to the room door as fast as I could, and who should I stumble over but a cobbler and his seat, and if he did not work at me with his awls and his pinchers you may call me a rogue. Well, I got away from him somehow, but when I was passing through the door, it must be the divel himself that pounced down on me with his claws, and his teeth, that were equal to sixpenny nails, and his wings -- ill luck be in his road! Well, at last I reached the stable, and there, by way of salute, I got a pelt from a sledge-hammer that sent me half a mile off. If you don't believe me, I'll give you leave to go and judge for yourselves."" ""Oh, my poor captain,"" says they, ""we believe you to the nines. Catch us, indeed, going within a hen's race of that unlucky cabin!"" Well, before the sun shook his doublet next morning, Jack and his comrades were up and about. They made a hearty breakfast on what was left the night before, and then they all agreed to set off to the castle of the Lord of Dunlavin, and give him back all his gold and silver. Jack put it all in the two ends of a sack, and laid it across Neddy's back, and all took the road in their hands. Away they went, through bogs, up hills, down dales, and sometimes along the yalla high road, till they came to the hall door of the Lord of Dunlavin, and who should be there, airing his powdered head, his white stockings, and his red breeches, but the thief of a porter. He gave a cross look to the visitors, and says he to Jack, ""What do you want here, my fine fellow? There isn't room for you all."" ""We want,"" says Jack, ""what I'm sure you haven't to give us -- and that is, common civility."" ""Come, be off, you lazy geochachs (greedy strollers)!"" says he, ""while a cat 'ud be licking her ear, or I'll let the dogs at you."" ""Would you tell a body,"" says the cock that was perched on the ass's head, ""who was it that opened the door for the robbers the other night?"" Ah! maybe the porter's red face didn't turn the colour of his frill, and the Lord of Dunlavin and his pretty daughter, that were standing at the parlour window unknownst to the porter, put out their heads. ""I'd be glad, Barney,"" says the master, ""to hear your answer to the gentleman with the red comb on him."" ""Ah, my lord, don't believe the rascal; sure I didn't open the door to the six robbers."" ""And how did you know there were six, you poor innocent?"" said the lord. ""Never mind, sir,"" says Jack, ""all your gold and silver is there in that sack, and I don't think you will begrudge us our supper and bed after our long march from the wood of Athsalach (muddy ford)."" ""Begrudge, indeed! Not one of you will ever see a poor day if I can help it."" So all were welcomed to their heart's content, and the ass, and the dog, and the cock got the best posts in the farmyard, and the cat took possession of the kitchen. The lord took Jack in hands, dressed him from top to toe in broadcloth, and frills as white as snow, and turnpumps, and put a watch in his fob. When they sat down to dinner, the lady of the house said Jack had the air of a born gentleman about him, and the lord said he'd make him his steward. Jack brought his mother, and settled her comfortably near the castle, and all were as happy as you please. The old woman that told me the story said Jack and the young lady were married ; but if they were, I hope he spent two or three years getting the edication of a gentleman. I don't think that a country boy would feel comfortable, striving to find discoorse for a well-bred young lady, the length of a summer's day, even if he had the Academy of Compliments and the Complete Letter Writer by heart.* *Footnote: Two chap or pedler's books, great favourites among our populace during the last century, and still finding some readers.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Animals and the Devil,"However, after the meal the servant warned the cat, ""Flee, otherwise early tomorrow you'll be slaughtered."" The cat took the warning to heart, and the next morning when they wanted to kill her, she had fled, and they heard nothing more from her. The next evening the man said, ""Tomorrow morning we have to slaughter our rooster."" The servant warned the rooster as well, and he too hurriedly left the farmyard. In like manner the ox ran away as well, and the three of them came together in the woods. They wandered on through the trees. A wolf approached them, and they asked him, ""Where are you going?"" ""I'm headed for the herd over there,"" answered the wolf. ""I'll try to catch a little lamb for a snack."" ""Don't go there!"" replied the others. ""They will kill you. Instead, come with us."" The wolf agreed to this, and the four went on their way. A bear approached them, and they asked him, ""Where are you going?"" ""To the village over there, where I'll get some oats to eat,"" answered the bear. ""Don't go there; it's too dangerous,"" said the others. You'd better come with us instead."" So the bear joined them, and after the five of them had gone a little further they came upon a hare. They convinced him to come with them as well. Coming to a village, and they approached a bath-house. A dog lay at its entrance, and he warned them, ""Don't go inside. Evil spirits live there."" But they went inside anyway. The bear laid himself down on the doorstep; the wolf between the doorposts; the ox found a corner for himself; the rooster flew onto a rafter; the cat lay on the hearth; the hare under the bench; and the dog in the middle of the room. The devil came to the bath-house and opened the door. The wolf immediately bit him in the leg; the bear hit him with his paw; the ox butted him with his horns; the rooster began to crow and the cat to meow; the hare jumped back and forth under the bench, and the dog ran around and around the room. Frightened by all the confusion, the devil fell over backwards. Picking himself up, he freed himself from his enemies' claws and fled out the door into the woods, where he claimed to his companions: ""Don't go into the bath-house. Powerful strangers are there. On the doorstep a tailor stuck me with his needles. A rough-haired man hit me in the chest with his fists. A cobbler hit me with his gear-bag until I fell over backward. The apprentices ran around the room, jumping from one corner to the other with glowing eyes, trying to beat me, but they couldn't find me. One of them [the rooster] cried out to them as I was getting away: 'Grab the guy! Grab the guy!'""",Finland,"Source (books.google.com): Emmy Schreck, ""Die Thiere und der Teufel,"" Finnische Märchen (Weimar: Hermann Böhlau, 1887), pp. 224-26.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Bremen Town Musicians,"A man had a donkey, who for long years had untiringly carried sacks to the mill, but whose strength was now failing, so that he was becoming less and less able to work. Then his master thought that he would no longer feed him, but the donkey noticed that it was not a good wind that was blowing and ran away, setting forth on the road to Bremen, where he thought he could become a town musician. When he had gone a little way he found a hunting dog lying in the road, who was panting like one who had run himself tired. ""Why are you panting so, Grab-Hold?"" asked the donkey. ""Oh,"" said the dog, ""because I am old and am getting weaker every day and can no longer go hunting, my master wanted to kill me, so I ran off; but now how should I earn my bread?"" ""Do you know what,"" said the donkey, ""I am going to Bremen and am going to become a town musician there. Come along and take up music too. I'll play the lute, and you can beat the drums."" The dog was satisfied with that, and they went further. It didn't take long, before they came to a cat sitting by the side of the road and making a face like three days of rainy weather. ""What has crossed you, old Beard-Licker?"" said the donkey. ""Oh,"" answered the cat, ""who can be cheerful when his neck is at risk? I am getting on in years, and my teeth are getting dull, so I would rather sit behind the stove and purr than to chase around after mice. Therefore my mistress wanted to drown me, but I took off. Now good advice is scarce. Where should I go?"" ""Come with us to Bremen. After all, you understand night music. You can become a town musician there."" The cat agreed and went along. Then the three refugees came to a farmyard, and the rooster of the house was sitting on the gate crying with all his might. ""Your cries pierce one's marrow and bone,"" said the donkey. ""What are you up to?"" ""I just prophesied good weather,"" said the rooster, ""because it is Our Dear Lady's Day, when she washes the Christ Child's shirts and wants to dry them; but because Sunday guests are coming tomorrow, the lady of the house has no mercy and told the cook that she wants to eat me tomorrow in the soup, so I am supposed to let them cut off my head this evening. Now I am going to cry at the top of my voice as long as I can."" ""Hey now, Red-Head,"" said the donkey, ""instead come away with us. We're going to Bremen. You can always find something better than death. You have a good voice, and when we make music together, it will be very pleasing."" The rooster was happy with the proposal, and all four went off together. However, they could not reach the city of Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came into a forest, where they would spend the night. The donkey and the dog lay down under a big tree, but the cat and the rooster took to the branches. The rooster flew right to the top, where it was safest for him. Before falling asleep he looked around once again in all four directions, and he thought that he saw a little spark burning in the distance. He hollered to his companions, that there must be a house not too far away, for a light was shining. The donkey said, ""Then we must get up and go there, because the lodging here is poor."" The dog said that he could do well with a few bones with a little meat on them. Thus they set forth toward the place where the light was, and they soon saw it glistening more brightly, and it became larger and larger, until they came to the front of a brightly lit robbers' house. The donkey, the largest of them, approached the window and looked in. ""What do you see, Gray-Horse?"" asked the rooster. ""What do I see?"" answered the donkey. ""A table set with good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting there enjoying themselves."" ""That would be something for us,"" said the rooster. ""Ee-ah, ee-ah, oh, if we were there!"" said the donkey. Then the animals discussed how they might drive the robbers away, and at last they came upon a plan. The donkey was to stand with his front feet on the window, the dog to jump on the donkey's back, the cat to climb onto the dog, and finally the rooster would fly up and sit on the cat's head. When they had done that, at a signal they began to make their music all together. The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat meowed and the rooster crowed. Then they crashed through the window into the room, shattering the panes. The robbers jumped up at the terrible bellowing, thinking that a ghost was coming in, and fled in great fear out into the woods. Then the four companions seated themselves at the table and freely partook of the leftovers, eating as if they would get nothing more for four weeks. When the four minstrels were finished, they put out the light and looked for a place to sleep, each according to his nature and his desire. The donkey lay down on the manure pile, the dog behind the door, the cat on the hearth next to the warm ashes, and the rooster sat on the beam of the roof. Because they were tired from their long journey, they soon fell asleep. When midnight had passed and the robbers saw from the distance that the light was no longer burning in the house, and everything appeared to be quiet, the captain said, ""We shouldn't have let ourselves be chased off,"" and he told one of them to go back and investigate the house. The one they sent found everything still, and went into the kitchen to strike a light. He mistook the cat's glowing, fiery eyes for live coals, and held a sulfur match next to them, so that it would catch fire. But the cat didn't think this was funny and jumped into his face, spitting, and scratching. He was terribly frightened and ran toward the back door, but the dog, who was lying there, jumped up and bit him in the leg. When he ran across the yard past the manure pile, the donkey gave him a healthy blow with his hind foot, and the rooster, who had been awakened from his sleep by the noise and was now alert, cried down from the beam, ""Cock-a-doodle-doo!"" Then the robber ran as fast as he could back to his captain and said, ""Oh, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, she blew at me and scratched my face with her long fingers. And there is a man with a knife standing in front of the door, and he stabbed me in the leg. And a black monster is lying in the yard, and it struck at me with a wooden club. And the judge is sitting up there on the roof, and he was calling out, 'Bring the rascal here.' Then I did what I could to get away."" From that time forth, the robbers did not dare go back into the house. However, the four Bremen Musicians liked it so well there, that they never left it again. And the person who just told that, his mouth is still warm.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen[Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales], 7th edition (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 27, pp. 145-48.","The Grimms' source: Dorothea Viehmann (1755-1815).

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,"The Bull, the Tup, the Cock, and the Steg","A bull, a tup [ram], a cock, and a steg [gander] set out together to seek their fortune. When it got to night, they came to a house, and asked for a night's lodging, but the folks said no. However, at last they were let come into the kitchen. The bull said he would lie on the floor, the tup said he would lie by his side, the cock would perch on the rannel bank, and the steg would stand at t' back of the door. At midnight, when all was quiet, two men, meaning to rob the house, were heard parleying outside which should go in, and which watch outside.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Choristers of St. Gudule,"The miller of Sandhills had a donkey which had served him well in its time, but was now too old to work. The miller was a careful man, who did not believe in feeding useless mouths, so he decided that he would sell the donkey for the price of its skin. ""I do not suppose I shall get very much for the wretched beast,"" he said, regarding poor Grayskin as he stood with hanging head in his stall, ""but I shall save the cost of his corn anyhow, and that is always something."" Left alone, Grayskin reflected sadly upon the fate in store for him. ""Such is the way of the world,"" he thought. ""When I was young and hearty nothing was too good for me. Now I'm old and useless I am to be cast out. But am I so useless after all? True, I can no longer pull a cart to market, but I have a magnificent voice still. There must be a place somewhere for one who can sing as beautifully as I. I'll go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule in Brussels and offer myself as a chorister."" Grayskin lost no time in acting upon his resolve, but left his stable immediately and set out on the road to Brussels. Passing the burgomaster's house he saw an old hound sitting disconsolately on the doorstep. ""Hallo, friend!"" said he. ""What is the matter with you? You seem very sad this morning."" ""The matter is that I am tired of life,"" answered the dog. ""I'm getting old and stiff, and I can no longer hunt hares for my master as I used to do. The result is that I am reckoned good for nothing, and they grudge me every morsel of food I put into my mouth."" ""Come, come, cheer up, my friend,"" said Grayskin. ""Never say die! I am in a similar case to yourself and have just left my master for precisely the same reason. My plan is to go to the Cathedral of St. Gudule and offer my services to the master of the choir. If I may say so without conceit, I have a lovely voice -- one must make the most of one's gifts, you know -- and I ought to be able to command good pay."" ""Well, if it comes to that,"" said the dog, ""I can sing too. I sang a lovely song to the moon last night, and if you'll believe me, all the people in our street opened their windows to listen. I sang for quite an hour, and I'd have gone on longer if some malicious person, who was no doubt jealous, had not thrown an old boot at my head."" ""Excellent,"" said Grayskin. ""Come along with me. You shall sing tenor and I'll sing bass. We'll make a famous pair."" So the dog joined company with Grayskin, and they went on together towards Brussels. A little farther down the road they saw a cat sitting on the rubbish heap outside a miserable hovel. The creature was half blind with age and had a face as long as a fiddle. ""Why, what is the matter with you?"" asked Grayskin, who had a tender heart. ""Matter enough,"" said the cat. ""I've just been turned out of house and home, and all because I took a little piece of bacon from the larder. Upon my honor, it was no bigger than a baby's fist, but they made as much fuss as though it had been a whole gammon. I was beaten and kicked out to starve. If I could catch mice as I used to do, it would not matter so much, but the mice are too quick for me nowadays. They laugh at me. Nothing remains for me but to die, and I hope it may be soon."" ""Nonsense,"" said Grayskin. ""You shall live to laugh at all your troubles. Come along with us and sing in the choir at St. Gudule. Your voice is a little too thin for my own taste, but you'll make a very good soprano in a trio. What do you say?"" ""You give me new hopes,"" answered the cat. ""Of course I'll join you,"" and so the three went on together. Towards nightfall they arrived at a farmyard, on the gate of which a cock was crowing lustily. ""Hall!"" said Grayskin. ""What's all this about?"" ""I am singing my last song on earth,"" said the cock. ""An hour ago I sang a song, although it is not my usual custom to crow in the afternoon, and as I ended I heard the farmer's wife say, 'Hearken to Chanticleer. He's crowing for fine weather tomorrow. I wonder if he'd crow so loudly if he knew that we had guests coming, and that he was going into the pot to make their soup!' She has a horrid laugh, that woman. I have always hated her!"" ""And do you mean to tell me,"" said Grayskin, ""that you are going to stay here quite contentedly till they come to wring your neck?"" ""What else can I do?"" asked Chanticleer. ""Join us and turn your talents to account. We are all beautiful singers and we are going to Brussels to offer ourselves as choristers at St. Gudule. We were a trio before. With you we shall be a quartet, and that's one better!"" Chanticleer was only too glad to find a means of escape, so he willingly joined the party, and they once more took the road. A little while afterwards they came to a thick wood, which was the haunt of a notorious band of robbers. There they decided to rest for the night, so Grayskin and the dog lay down beneath the shelter of a large beech tree, while the cat climbed onto one of the branches, and Chanticleer perched himself at the very top. From this lofty post he could see over the whole wood, and it was not long before he espied a light twinkling among the trees not far away. ""There must be a house of some sort over there,"" he said to his companions. ""Shall we go and see? We may find something to eat."" ""Or some straw to lie upon, at any rate,"" said Grayskin. ""This damp ground gives me rheumatics in my old bones."" ""I was just thinking the same thing,"" said the dog. ""Let us go."" So the four choristers, led by the cock, walked in the direction from which the light came, and before long they found themselves in front of a little house, the windows of which were brilliantly lighted. In order to reach to the windows the animals made a tower of their bodies, with Grayskin at the bottom and Chanticleer at the top. Now this house was the abode of a band of robbers, who, at that very moment, were seated before a table laden with all kinds of food. There they sat and feasted, and poor Chanticleer's mouth watered as he watched them. ""Is there anybody inside?"" asked the dog, who was impatient. ""Hush!"" said Chanticleer. ""Men! They're eating their dinner!"" ""I wish I was,"" said the dog. ""What are they eating?"" ""All sorts of things -- sausage and fish ...."" ""Sausage!"" said the dog. ""Fish!"" said the cat. ""And ever so many other delicacies,"" Chanticleer went on. ""Look here, friends. Wouldn't it be a fine thing if we could get a share of their meal? I confess that my stomach aches with hunger."" ""And mine too,"" said the dog. ""I've never been so hungry in my life. But how are we to get the food?"" ""Let us serenade them, and perhaps they'll throw us something as a reward,"" said Grayskin. ""Music, you know, has charms to soothe the savage breast."" This seemed such a good idea that the choristers lost no time in putting it into execution. All four began to sing. They donkey hee-hawed, the dog howled, the cat meowed, and the cock crowed. From the noise they made one would have thought that the heavens were falling. The effect of this marvelous quartet upon the robbers was instantaneous. Leaping from their seats, they ran from place to place in mortal terror, tumbling over one another, oversetting chairs and adding to the racket by their shrieks and cries. At that moment the cock fell against the window, breaking the glass to smithereens. The donkey gave the frame a push, and all the four precipitated themselves into the room. This was the last straw. The robbers could stand no more. Half mad with fear they rushed to the door and fled into the forest. Then our four choristers drew up to the table and set to work upon the food with which it was laden. Their long walk had given them a good appetite, so that there was little left by the time they had finished. Feeling drowsy after their meal, they then settled themselves to sleep. The donkey made himself a bed on a heap of straw in the yard; the dog stretched himself out upon the mat by the house door; the cat lay among the warm cinders on the hearth; and the cock perched upon the rooftop. A few minutes more and they were all fast asleep. Meanwhile the robbers, who had retreated some distance into the forest, waited anxiously for something dreadful to happen. An hour passed by and there was neither sight nor sound to alarm them, so they began to feel a little ashamed of their cowardice. Creeping stealthily nearer to the cottage, they saw that everything was still, and that no light was showing from the windows. At last the robber chief sent his lieutenant to spy out the land, and this man, returning to the cottage without mishap, found his way into the kitchen and proceeded to light a candle. He had no matches, but he saw two sparks of fire among the cinders on the hearth, so he went forward to get a light from them. Now this light came from the cat's eyes, and as soon as puss felt the robber touch her, she sprang up, snarling and spitting, and scratched his face. With a scream of terror, he dropped his candle and rushed for the door, and as he passed, the dog bit him in the leg. By this time the noise had awakened Grayskin, who got upon his feet just as the man ran by, and helped him forward with a might kick, which sent him flying out into the roadway. Seeing this, the cock on the housetop spread his wings and crowed in triumph, ""Cock-a-doodle-doo!"" I wish you could have seen the way that robber ran! He covered the ground so quickly that he seemed like a flying shadow, and I am perfectly certain that not even a hare could have overtaken him. At last, panting for breath, he rejoined his comrades in the forest, who were eagerly awaiting his return. ""Well,"" cried the chief, ""is the way clear? Can we go back?"" ""Not on any account,"" cried the robber. ""There's a horrible witch in the kitchen. Directly I entered she sprang at me and tore my face with her long claws, calling out at the same time to her creatures to come and devour me. As I ran through the door, one of them buried his fangs in my leg, and a little farther on, in the yard, a great black monster struck at me with an enormous club, giving me a blow that nearly broke my backbone. On the roof a little demon with wings and eyes that shone like coals of fire cried, 'Stop him! Eat him! Stop him! Eat him!' You may guess that I did not wait for more. It is a miracle that I have escaped with my life!"" When they heard this terrible story the robbers lost no time in decamping, and such was their terror that they deserted the forest altogether and went away to another part of the country. The result was that our four friends were left to dwell in the cottage, where they lived happily for the rest of their lives, and as they had now everything they wanted, they quite gave up their idea of going to St. Gudule.",Flanders,"Source: Jean de Bosschère, Folk Tales of Flanders (New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company, 1918), pp. 41-49.","The medieval principality of Flanders includes portions of modern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.",NA
The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,"The Dog, the Cat, the Ass, and the Cock","Once upon a time, a long while ago, when beasts and fowls could talk, it happened that a dog lived in a farmer's barnyard. By and by he grew tired of watching the house all night and working hard all day, so he thought he'd go out into the world to seek his fortune. One fine day, when the farmer had gone away, he started off down the road. He hadn't gone far when he spied a cat curled up asleep on a door-stone in a farmer's yard, so he looked over the fence and called to the cat, ""I'm going out into the world to seek my fortune. Don't you want to come along too?"" But the cat said she was very comfortable where she was, and didn't think she cared to go traveling. But the dog told her that by and by when she got old the farmer wouldn't let her lie on his sunny door-stone, but would make her lie in the cold, no matter whether it snowed or not. So the cat concluded she'd go along too, and they walked down the road arm in arm. They hadn't gone far when they spied a jackass eating grass in a farmer's yard. So the dog looked over the fence and called to the jackass, ""We're going out into the world to seek our fortune. Don't you want to come along too?"" But the jackass said he was very comfortable where he was, and didn't think he cared to go traveling. But the dog told him that by and by, when he got old and stiff, he'd have to work early and late, year after year, for only just what he would eat, and short allowance at that. So the jackass concluded to go along too, and they all walked down the road arm in arm. They hadn't gone far when they spied a cock crowing in a farmer's yard, so the dog looked over the fence and called, ""We're going out into the world to seek our fortune. Don't you want to come along too?"" But the rooster said he was very comfortable where he was, and didn't think he cared to go traveling. But the dog told him that by and by, when it came Thanksgiving, pop would go his head, and he'd make a fine dinner for the farmer. So the rooster concluded he'd go along too, and they all walked down the road arm in arm. Now they had neglected to take anything to eat along with them, and when night overtook them, weary, footsore, and hungry, they were in a dense forest, and they all began to blame the dog for getting them into such a scrape. The ass proposed that the cock should fly to the top of a high tree to see if he could discover a place for them to lodge. He had scarcely perched on a limb before he called to his friends that a house was a little way off, for he could see a light in the window. The dog called to him to come down and lead the was to the house, and they all walked off arm in arm to the house. When they got there it was perfectly still about the house. They could hear no one inside. The ass kicked at the door, but no one answered. They looked about and found the house had only one window, and that was so high up they couldn't look in. He proposed that the jackass should stand on his hind legs, with his forelegs resting against the house, while the dog should clamber up his back and stand on his head, the cat run up the backs of both, and the rooster fly to the cat's head, and then he could just look in at the window. ""Hurry and tell what you see,"" said the jackass, ""for my neck is breaking off."" ""I see a fire on a hearth and a table loaded with all sorts of fine things to eat: turkey and plum pudding, and pan-dowdy, and a band of men sitting round the table."" ""Zounds!"" said the dog, ""we must get in."" So the rooster flew against the window with such a crash that it scared the robbers -- for this was a band of robbers -- nearly to death. They jumped up from the table so quickly that they overturned their chairs and whisked out the candles, while in flew the rooster, the cat, and the dog at the window, while the jackass went round and waited at the door till the robbers came out and ran away. Then the beasts lighted the candles again, and picked up the chairs, and sat down and had a good supper. Then they began to look about to see how they should dispose of themselves for the night. The jackass went out in the barn to sleep in the hay, the dog lay on the rug by the hearth, the cat took up her bed among the warm ashes, and the rooster flew to the ridgepole of the house, and soon all were fast asleep, being very tired by their long day's journey. By and by the robbers plucked up courage, and about midnight came back to the house to see if perchance they had not been scared at their shadows. Two of them got in at the window to take a survey, and seeing the cat's glowing eyes in the ashes mistook them for coals, and scratching a match in them the cat sunk her claws in his hand, which terrified him so much that in attempting to escape he ran against the dog, and he in turn caught the robber by the leg and bit him. By this time the tumult had awakened the ass, and just as the robber rushed out at the door the jackass met him and kicked him ten feet in the air, while the rooster set up a hideous crowing. It took but a few minutes for the robbers to escape to the woods and find their companions, to whom they told a doleful tale, how in trying to light a match at the fireplace the devil with red-hot eyes stuck his claws into his hands, a second devil attacked him in the rear, while another devil kicked him into the air, and as he came down on the greensward, more dead than alive, another horrid demon form the housetop cried out, ""Throw the rascal up her, through the rascal up here."" The thieves could never be induced to go back to the house. They thought it haunted by devils. So our friends, the jackass, the dog, the cat, and the rooster, lived there happy forever after, preferring it to traveling about to see the world.",USA,"Source: Journal of American Folk-Lore, vol. 1 (1888), pp. 230-33.","Contributed by Miss H.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Robber and the Farm Animals,"Once upon a time there was a miller's servant who had served his master faithfully and diligently for many years. He had grown old in the mill, and the heavy work that he had to do there finally surpassed his strength. So one day he said to his master: ""I can no longer serve you; I am too weak. I am therefore asking you for my dismissal and my wages."" The miller said: ""The time of wandering servants has passed. You are free to leave if you wish, but you will receive no wages. Now the old servant would sooner give up his wages than to continue to be tormented in the mill, so he took leave from his master. Before leaving home he went to the animals that until now he had fed and tended, in order to bid them farewell. While taking leave from the horse, it said to him: ""Where are you going?"" ""I have to leave,"" he said. ""I cannot take it here any longer."" And when he set forth, the horse followed along after him. He then went to the ox, stroked him once again, and said: ""God be with you, old fellow!"" ""Where are you going?"" spoke the ox. ""Oh, I must leave. I cannot take it here any longer,"" said the miller's servant and sadly went on his way to take leave from the dog. The ox followed along behind, just as the horse had done. And the other animals to whom he said farewell -- the dog, the cat, the goose, and the rooster -- all did the same thing. He made his way out into the country, where he first noticed that the faithful animals were following him. He spoke to them in a friendly manner, asking them to turn around and return home. ""I have nothing more for myself,"" he said, ""and I can no longer care for you."" But the animals told him that they would not abandon him, and they contentedly followed along behind. After several days they came to a great forest. Here the horse and the ox found good grass, which the goose and the rooster enjoyed as well. However, the other animals -- the cat and the dog -- had to suffer hunger, as did the old miller's servant; but they did not grumble and complain. Finally, after having gone very deep into the forest, they suddenly saw a large, beautiful house before them. It was locked up securely. Only an empty stall was open, and from here they could go through the barn into the house itself. Because no one could be seen in the house, the servant decided to stay there with his animals, and he assigned each one to a place. He put the horse up front in the stall. He led the ox to the other side. The rooster was given a place on the roof, the dog on the manure pile, the cat on the hearth, and the goose behind the stove. Then he gave each one his feed, which was plentifully stored in the house. He himself ate and drank all he wanted, then fell asleep in a good bed, which was all made up in the bedroom. During the night, while he was fast asleep, the robber -- who owned the forest house -- returned. As he stepped into yard, the dog jumped on him furiously, and barked at him. The rooster cried down from the roof: ""Cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-doo!"" All this terrified the robber, for he had never seen farm animals that live with people, knowing instead only the wild animals of the forest. He fled hurriedly into the stall, but there the horse kicked out from behind, hitting him in the side. He staggered around and around, and only with difficulty could he retreat into the back part of the stall. He scarcely arrived there when the ox turned around and tried to pick him up on his horns. This frightened him anew, and he ran as fast as he could through the barn and into the kitchen, where he wanted to strike a light and see what was there. Feeling around the hearth, he touched the cat, which jumped on him and scratched him with its claws until jumped away head over heels, and tried to hide behind the stove in the main room. The goose jumped up, screaming and beating its wings. The terrified robber fled into the bedroom. There the miller's servant was snoring mightily like a purring spinning wheel, and the robber thought the entire room was filled with strangers. You had better believe that he was overcome by a terrible fear. He rushed out of the house and ran into the woods, not stopping until until he had found his fellow robbers. He began talking: ""I don't know what has happened in our house. Some strange people are living there. When I stepped into the yard a large wildman jumped at me, yelling and bellowing so terribly that I thought he would kill me. An another one cheered him on, calling down from the roof: 'Hit him for me too! Hit him for me too!' The first one was bad enough; I wasn't going to wait for more of them to jump me, so I fled into the stall. There a shoemaker threw a last at my side, and I can still feel where it hit. I ran to the back of the stall. A pitchfork maker was standing there who tried to impale me on his pitchfork. I ran into the kitchen, where a hackle maker beat me with his hackle [a sharp-toothed tool for combing flax]. I tried to hide behind the stove, but there was a shovel maker there who beat me with his shovel. Finally I ran into the bedroom, but there were so many others snoring in there that was happy to escape with my life."" When the robbers heard this, they were so horrified that not a one of them had any desire to enter the house. To the contrary, they believed that the entire region was threatened by these strange people. That same night they departed for another country, and they never returned. The miller's servant lived in peace in the robbers' house with his faithful animals. He no longer had to suffer in his old age, for the beautiful garden next to the house produced more fruit, vegetables, and all kinds of food every year than he and his animals could eat.",Germany/Switzerland,"Source: Ernst Meier, ""Der Räuber und die Hausthiere,"" Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Schwaben: Aus dem Munde des Volks gesammelt (Stuttgart: C.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Sheep and the Pig Who Set Up House,"So it went on, till, one day, the dairymaid came and gave him still more food, and then she said, ""Eat. away, sheep; you won't be much longer here; we are going to kill you tomorrow."" It is an old saying, that women's counsel is always worth having, and that there is a cure and physic for everything but death. ""But, after all,"" said the sheep to himself, ""there may be a cure even for death this time."" So he ate till he was ready to burst; and when he was crammed full, he butted out the door of the pen, and took his way to the neighboring farm. There he went to the pigsty to a pig whom he had known out on the common, and ever since had been the best friends with. ""Good day!"" said the sheep, ""and thanks for our last merry meeting."" ""Good day!"" answered the pig, ""and the same to you."" ""Do you know,"" said the sheep, ""why it is you are so well off, and why it is they fatten you and take such pains with you?"" ""No, I don't,"" said the pig. ""Many a flask empties the cask; I suppose you know that,"" said the sheep. ""They are going to kill and eat you."" ""Are they?"" said the pig. ""Well, I hope they'll say grace after meat."" ""If you will do as I do,"" said the sheep, ""we'll go off to the wood, build us a house, and set up for ourselves. A home is a home be it ever so homely."" Yes! The pig was willing enough. ""Good company is such a comfort,"" he said, and so the two set off. So, when they had gone a bit they met a goose. ""Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting,"" said the goose. ""Whither away so fast today?"" ""Good day, and the same to you,"" said the sheep. ""You must know we were too well off at home, and so we are going to set up for ourselves in the wood, for you know every man's house is his castle."" ""Well!"" said the goose, ""it's much the same with me where I am. Can't I go with you too, for it's child's play when three share the day."" ""With gossip and gabble is built neither house nor stable,"" said the pig. ""Let us know what you can do."" ""By cunning and skill a cripple can do what he will,"" said the goose. ""I can pluck moss and stuff it into the seams of the planks, and your house will be tight and warm."" ""Yes! They would give him leave, for above all things, piggy wished to be warm and comfortable. So, when they had gone a bit farther -- the goose had hard work to walk so fast -- they met a hare, who came frisking out of the wood. ""Good day, good sirs, and thanks for our last merry meeting,"" she said. ""How far are you trotting today?"" ""Good day, and the same to you,"" said the sheep. ""We were far too well off at home, and so we're going to the wood, to build us a house, and set up for ourselves, for you know, try all the world round, there's nothing like home."" ""As for that,"" said the hare, ""I have a house in every bush -- yes, a house in every bush; but, yet, I have often said, in winter, 'If I only live till summer, I'll build me a house.' And so I have half a mind to go with you and build one up, after all."" ""Yes!"" said the pig. ""If we ever get into a scrape, we might use you to scare away the dogs, for you don't fancy you could help us in house building."" ""He who lives long enough always finds work enough to do,"" said the hare. ""I have teeth to gnaw pegs, and paws to drive them into the wall, so I can very well set up to be a carpenter, for 'good tools make good work,' as the man said, when he flayed the mare with a gimlet."" Yes! He too got leave to go with them and build their house; there was nothing more to be said about it. When they had gone a bit farther they met a cock. ""Good day, good sirs,"" said the cock, ""and thanks for our last merry meeting. Whither are ye going today, gentlemen?"" ""Good day, and the same to you,"" said the sheep. ""At home we were too well off, and so we are going off to the wood to build us a house, and set up for ourselves; for he who out of doors shall bake, loses at last both coal and cake."" ""Well! said the cock, ""that's just my case; but it's better to sit on one's own perch, for then one can never be left in the lurch, and, besides, all cocks crow loudest at home. Now, if I might have leave to join such a gallant company, I also would like to go to the wood and build a house."" ""Ay! Ay!"" said the pig. ""Flapping and crowing sets tongues a-going; but a jaw on a stick never yet laid a brick. How can you ever help us to build a house?"" ""Oh!"" said the cock, ""that house will never have a clock, where there is neither dog nor cock. I am up early, and I wake every one."" ""Very true,"" said the pig. ""The morning hour has a golden dower; let him come with us;"" for, you must know, piggy was always the soundest sleeper. ""Sleep is the biggest thief,"" he said. ""He thinks nothing of stealing half one's life."" So they all set off to the wood, as a band and brotherhood, and built the house. The pig hewed the timber, and the sheep drew it home; the hare was carpenter, and gnawed pegs and bolts, and hammered them into the walls and roof; the goose plucked moss and stuffed it into the seams; the cock crew, and looked out that they did not oversleep themselves in the morning; and when the house was ready, and the roof lined with birch bark, and thatched with turf. There they lived by themselves, and were merry and well. ""Tis good to travel east and west,"" said the sheep, ""but after all a home is best."" But you must know that a bit farther on in the wood was a wolf's den, and there lived two graylegs. So when they saw that a new house had risen up hard by, they wanted to know what sort of folk their neighbors were, for they thought to themselves that a good neighbor was better than a brother in a foreign land, and that it was better to live in a good neighborhood than to know many people miles and miles off. So one of them made up an errand, and went into the new house and asked for a light for his pipe. But as soon as ever he got inside the door, the sheep gave him such a butt that he fell head foremost into the stove. Then the pig began to gore and bite him, the goose to nip and peck him, the cock upon the roost to crow and chatter; and as for the hare -- he was so frightened out of his wits, that he ran about aloft and on the floor, and scratched and scrambled in every corner of the house. So after a long time the wolf came out. ""Well!"" said the one who waited for him outside, ""neighborhood makes brotherhood. You must have come into a perfect paradise on bare earth, since you stayed so long. But what became of the light, for you have neither pipe nor smoke."" ""Yes, yes!"" said the other. ""It was just a nice light and a pleasant company. Such manners I never saw in all my life. But then you know we can't pick and choose in this wicked world, and an unbidden guest gets bad treatment. As soon as I got inside the door, the shoemaker let fly at me with his last, so that I fell head foremost into the stithy fire; and there sat two smiths who blew the bellows and made the sparks fly, and beat and punched me with red hot tongs and pincers, so that they tore whole pieces out of my body. As for the hunter he went scrambling about looking for his gun, and it was good luck he did not find it. And all the while there was another who sat up under the roof, and slapped his arms and sang out, 'Put a hook into him and drag him hither; drag him hither.' That was what he screamed, and if he had only got hold of me, I should never have come out alive.""",Norway,"Source (books.google.com): Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, Tales from the Fjeld: A Second Series of Popular Tales, translated by G.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The Story of the White Pet,"There was a farmer before now who had a White Pet (sheep), and when Christmas was drawing near, he thought that he would kill the White Pet. The White Pet heard that, and he thought he would run away; and that is what he did. He had not gone far when a bull met him. Said the bull to him, ""All hail! White Pet, where are you going?"" ""I,"" said the White Pet, ""am going to seek my fortune; they were going to kill me for Christmas, and I thought I had better run away."" ""It is better for me,"" said the bull, ""to go with you, for they were going to do the very same with me."" ""I am willing,"" said the White Pet; ""the larger the party the better the fun."" They went forward until they fell in with a dog. ""All hail! White Pet,"" said the dog. ""All hail! dog."" ""Where are you going?"" said the dog. ""I am running away, for I heard that they were threatening to kill me for Christmas."" ""They were going to do the very same to me,"" said the dog, ""and I will go with you."" ""Come, then,"" said the White Pet. They went then, until a cat joined them. ""All hail! White Pet,"" said the cat. ""All hail! oh cat."" ""Where are you going?"" said the cat. ""I am going to seek my fortune,"" said the White Pet, "" because they were going to kill me at Christmas."" ""They were talking about killing me too,"" said the cat,"" and I had better go with you."" ""Come on then,"" said the White Pet. Then they went forward until a cock met them. ""All hail! White Pet,"" said the cock. ""All hail to yourself! oh cock,"" said the White Pet. ""Where,"" said the cock,"" are you going?"" ""I,"" said the White Pet, ""am going away, for they were threatening my death at Christmas."" ""They were going to kill me at the very same time,"" said the cock, "" and I will go with you."" ""Come, then,"" said the White Pet. They went forward until they fell in with a goose. ""All hail! White Pet,"" said the goose. ""All hail to yourself! oh goose,"" said the White Pet. ""Where are you going?"" said the goose. ""I,"" said the White Pet, ""am running away, because they were going to kill me at Christmas."" ""They were going to do that to me too,"" said the goose, ""and I will go with you."" The party went forward until the night was drawing on them, and they saw a little light far away; and though far off, they were not long getting there. When they reached the house they said to each other that they would look in at the window to see who was in the house, and they saw thieves counting money; and the White Pet said, ""Let every one of us call his own call. I will call my own call; and let the bull call his own call; let the dog call his own call; and the cat her own call; and the cock his own call; and the goose his own call."" With that they gave out one shout -- Gaire! When the thieves heard the shouting outside, they thought the mischief was there; and they fled out, and they went to a wood that was near them. When the White Pet and his company saw that the house was empty, they went in and they got the money that the thieves had been counting, and they divided it among themselves; and then they thought that they would settle to rest. Said the White Pet, ""Where will you sleep tonight, oh bull?"" ""I will sleep,"" said the bull, ""behind the door where I used to be."" ""Where will you sleep, White Pet?"" ""I will sleep,"" said the White Pet, ""in the middle of the floor where I used to be."" ""Where will you sleep, oh dog?"" said the White Pet. ""I will sleep beside the fire where I used to be,"" said the dog. ""Where will you sleep, oh cat?"" ""I will sleep,"" said the cat, ""in the candle press, where I like to be."" ""Where will you sleep, oh cock?"" said the White Pet. ""I,"" said the cock, "" will sleep on the rafters where I used to be."" ""Where will you sleep, oh goose?"" ""I will sleep,"" said the goose, ""on the manure pile, where I was accustomed to be."" They were not long settled to rest, when one of the thieves returned to look in to see if he could perceive if any one at all was in the house. All things were still, and he went on forward to the candle press for a candle, that he might kindle to make him a light; but when he put his hand in the box the cat thrust her claws into his hand, but he took a candle with him, and he tried to light it. Then the dog got up, and he stuck his tail into a pot of water that was beside the fire; he shook his tail and put out the candle. Then the thief thought that the mischief was in the house, and he fled; but when he was passing the White Pet, he gave him a blow; before he got past the bull, he gave him a kick; and the cock began to crow; and when he went out, the goose began to belabor him with his wings about the shanks. He went to the wood where his comrades were, as fast as was in his legs. They asked him how it had gone with him. ""It went,"" said he, ""but middling; when I went to the candle press, there was a man in it who thrust ten knives into my hand; and when I went to the fireside to light the candle, there was a big black man lying there, who was sprinkling water on it to put it out; and when I tried to go out, there was a big man in the middle of the floor, who gave me a shove; and another man behind the door who pushed me out; and there was a little brat on the loft calling out Cuir-anees-an-shaw-ay-s-foni-mi-hayn-da -- Send him up here and I'll do for him; and there was a shoemaker, out on the manure pile, belaboring me about the shanks with his apron."" When the thieves heard that, they did not return to seek their lot of money; and the White Pet and his comrades got it to themselves; and it kept them peaceably as long as they lived.",Scotland,"Source: J.

The Bremen Town Musicians,0130,The World's Reward,"After he had walked quite a way he met an old bull in the veldt. ""Don't you want to go with me?"" asked the dog. ""Where?"" was the reply. ""To the land of the aged,"" said the dog, ""where troubles don't disturb you, and thanklessness does not deface the deeds of man."" ""Good,"" said the bull, ""I am your companion."" The two now walked on and found a ram. The dog laid the plan before him, and all moved off together, until they afterwards came successively upon a donkey, a cat, a cock, and a goose. These joined their company, and the seven set out on their journey. Late one night they came to a house, and through the open door they saw a table spread with all kinds of nice food, of which some robbers were having their fill. It would help nothing to ask for admittance, and seeing that they were hungry, they must think of something else. Therefore the donkey climbed up on the bull, the ram on the donkey, the dog on the ram, the cat on the dog, the goose on the cat, and the cock on the goose, and with one accord they all let out terrible (threatening) noises (cryings). The bull began to bellow, the donkey to bray, the dog to bark, the ram to bleat, the cat to mew, the goose to giggle gaggle, and the cock to crow, all without cessation. The people in the house were frightened perfectly limp; they glanced out through the front door, and there they stared on the strange sight. Some of them took to the ropes over the back lower door, some disappeared through the window, and in a few counts the house was empty. Then the seven old animals climbed down from one another, stepped into the house, and satisfied themselves with the delicious food. But when they had finished, there still remained a great deal of food, too much to take with them on their remaining journey, and so together they contrived a plan to hold their position until the next day after breakfast. The dog said, ""See here, I am accustomed to watch at the front door of my master's house,"" and thereupon flopped himself down to sleep; the bull said, ""I go behind the door,"" and there he took his position; the ram said, I will go up on to the loft""; the donkey, ""I at the middle door""; the cat, ""I in the fireplace""; the goose, ""I in the back door ""; and the cock said, ""I am going to sleep on the bed."" The captain of the robbers after a while sent one of his men back to see if these creatures had yet left the house. The man came very cautiously into the neighborhood, listened and listened, but he heard nothing; he peeped through the window, and saw in the grate just two coals still glimmering, and thereupon started to walk through the front door. There the old dog seized him by the leg. He jumped into the house, but the bull was ready, swept him up with his horns, and tossed him on to the loft. Here the ram received him and pushed him off the loft again. Reaching ground, he made for the middle door, but the donkey set up a terrible braying and at the same time gave him a kick that landed him in the fireplace, where the cat flew at him and scratched him nearly to pieces. He then jumped out through the back door, and here the goose got him by the trousers. When he was some distance away the cock crowed. He thereupon ran so that you could hear the stones rattle in the dark. Purple and crimson and out of breath, he came back to his companions. ""Frightful, frightful!"" was all that they could get from him at first, but after a while he told them, ""When I looked through the window I saw in the fireplace two bright coals shining, and when I wanted to go through the front door to go and look, I stepped into an iron trap. I jumped into the house, and there some one seized me with a fork and pitched me up on to the loft, there again someone was ready, and threw me down on all fours. I wanted to fly through the middle door, but there some one blew on a trumpet, and smote me with a sledge hammer so that I did not know where I landed; but coming to very quickly, I found I was in the fireplace, and there another flew at me and scratched the eyes almost out of my head. I thereupon fled out of the back door, and lastly I was attacked on the leg by the sixth with a pair of fire tongs, and when I was still running away, someone shouted out of the house, 'Stop him, stop h - i - m!'""

Bride Tests,1451,Choosing a Bride,"A man wanted to select a wife for himself from among three sisters, all of whom pleased him greatly. He invited them all to eat their noon meal with him at an inn. Wanting to find himself an industrious and efficient housewife, he decided to test them on how they ate cheese. When her cheese was served the eldest cut the rind off so thick that it included a lot of good cheese, which was thus lost. ""She will waste too much and throw out everything,"" thought the man. ""You cannot choose her."" Then the second sister received her cheese, and she ate her piece without cutting off any of the rind. ""She is not the wife for you either,"" thought the man. ""She will be disorderly."" Then the youngest sister was served her cheese. She scraped her piece off cleanly and carefully, and then ate it.

Serve them some cheese and pay attention to what they do with it."" The son followed this advice. He invited the girls to his house and served them cheese. The first one greedily ate her piece, complete with the rind, so that not a trace of it was left. The second one, to the contrary, cut off the rind so thick that she wasted a lot of good cheese. The third one neatly peeled off just the right amount of rind. The herdsman told his mother what had happened with the cheese, and she said, ""Choose the third one. She will bring you luck.""

Bride Tests,1451,The Hurds,"Once upon a time there was a girl who was beautiful, but lazy and negligent. When she had to spin she was so ill tempered that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and scattered it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and who gathered together the discarded flax, cleaned it, spun it well, and had a beautiful dress woven out of it for herself. A young man had courted the lazy girl, and the wedding was about to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious girl was dancing merrily about in her beautiful dress, and the bride said, Ach, wat kann das Mäken springen in minen Slickerlingen! Ah, how that girl can jump about, in my hurds! The bridegroom heard this, and asked the bride what she meant by it.

Bride Tests,1451,The Storehouse Key in the Distaff,"There was once a rich farmer's son who went out to woo. He had heard of a lass who was fair and gentle, and who was both clever in the house and good at cooking. Thither he went, for it was just such a wife he wanted. The people on the farm knew, of course, on what errand he came, so they asked him to take a seat near to them, and they talked and chatted with him, as the custom is, and beside offered him a drink and asked him to stop to dinner. They went in and out of the room, so the lad had time to look about him, and over in a corner he saw a spinning wheel with the distaff full of flax. ""Whose spinning wheel is that?"" asked the lad. ""Oh, that's our daughter's,"" said the woman of the house. ""There's a deal of flax on it,"" said the lad. ""I suppose she takes more than a day to spin that,"" said he. ""No, not at all,"" said the woman. ""She does it easily in one day and perhaps less than that."" That was more than he had ever heard of anyone being able to spin in such a short time. When they were going to carry in the dinner they all went out of the room and he was left alone. He then saw an old key lying in the window, and this he took and stowed well away among the flax on the distaff. So they ate and drank and got on well together, and when the lad thought he had been there long enough, he said good-bye and went his way. They asked him to come soon again, which he promised, but he did not speak of the matter he had at heart, although he liked the lass very well. Some time after, he came again to the farm, and they received him still better than the first time. But just as they were chatting at their best, the farmer's wife said, ""Last time you were here something very remarkable happened. Our storehouse key disappeared all at once, and we have never been able to find it since."" The lad went over to the spinning wheel, which stood in the corner with just as much flax on it as when last he was there. He put his hand in among the flax and said, ""Here is the key! Much cannot be made by the spinning when the spinning day lasts from Michaelmas [September 29] to Easter."" So he said good-bye, and did not speak of the matter he had at heart that time either.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, Fairy Tales from the Far North, translated by H. L. Brækstad.

Bride Tests,1451,The Suitor,"There was once a handsome young fellow by the name of Tom. From an old, wealthy uncle he had inherited a fine farm, and being well established in life, he determined to seek a wife. As he was quite wealthy, he considered himself able to afford a little more than ordinary people in this direction, for the wives of wealthy men must always be prettier and wiser than those of the poor, as we all know. So Tom wanted a wife who was handsome and industrious, wise and good, and of course it would not be out of the way if she possessed some property. One day he rode over to a rich farmer who lived in the neighborhood and who had three daughters, all of whom were ready to be married at once. He had seen, although he had never talked with, them, and thought well of all three. Now these girls, who were otherwise pretty and good, had one great fault: namely, that they could not talk distinctly. When Tom came riding into the yard the farmer received him kindly and conducted him into the room where the three girls sat spinning diligently. They nodded kindly to him and smiled, but did not utter a sound, as their mother had strictly forbidden them to do so. The farmer led the talking, while his wife waited on them with good food and drinks. The girls spun, and looked at the young man at the table, and glanced at each other and at the ceiling and out of the windows, but none of them spoke. At length the one happened to break her yarn. ""My 'arn bote!"" exclaimed she. ""Tie it adain,"" advised her sister. ""Mamma told us we say no'tin', and now we t'ant teep 'till!"" broke in the third one. When Tom heard these grown girls talk like babies he hurried away, utterly shocked. A wife who could not speak distinctly he had no use for at all. He proceeded to another farm, where they had a daughter who was said to be a very fine girl in all respects. Tom went into the house and saw her. If the first three ones had been too silent, this one talked, however, more fluently and volubly than any girl whom he had ever met. She talked like a house on fire, while her spinning wheel went more rapidly than any engine. ""How long does it take you to use up such a head of flax?"" asked the young man, pointing to the rock [distaff]. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I use up a couple of them every day."" While she left the room a few minutes to look after the servants, Tom seized a key from a drawer of a bureau in the room and stuffed it into the head of flax. When she returned they finished their conversation; whereupon he bid her parents and herself good-bye, promising to call again in a week. On the appointed day Tom returned. The girl and her parents expected him to talk this time of his errand. When he came into the room the girl was busy with her rock, as before. She bid him welcome, and invited him to sit down. ""How unfortunate!"" began she. ""We have been missing the key of that bureau ever since you were here. We are unable to find it, and I cannot reach any of my things. It never happened before."" On hearing this, Tom went over and pulled the key out of the head of flax. It was the same key, and, still worse, the very same head of flax that he had seen a week before. Thus he knew her word could not be depended upon; and bidding her good-bye he left at once, richer in experience than before. Some time afterwards he heard of a girl who was very pretty and good, but especially wise and thoughtful in all practical matters. Her parents were said to be the same. Tom saddled his horse and rode over to see her. The whole family was at home and received the young man very kindly. While the men drifted into a talk about the weather and crops, the women placed before them the best that the house could afford. ""Go into the cellar and fetch a bottle of wine,"" said the woman to her daughter. The girl went into the cellar, but was so busy thinking what pattern she might choose for a wedding dress that she sat down on the floor, lost in reflection upon this important subject, and the wine was entirely forgotten. After she had left the room, the parents told Tom of their daughter's many good qualities; how industrious she was, how thoughtful, and so on. The young man thought that she would be exactly such a wife as he wished. But as the girl did not appear with the wine, her mother went to see what had become of her. When she came into the cellar and found her daughter sitting on the floor, she asked, ""Why do you sit there, instead of bringing the wine?"" ""Well,"" was the answer, ""I am thinking that if I marry Tom I must make a careful choice of the pattern for my wedding gown. The question is, what pattern would do best?"" ""Yes, indeed,"" answered her mother, ""which pattern will be the most suitable?"" She sat down by her daughter, pondering over this important question. ""I wonder what has become of them both!"" at length exclaimed the man, referring to his wife and daughter. ""I must look after them."" He went into the cellar, and when he saw both women sitting on the floor he cried, ""Why are you both sitting here? You have kept us waiting for over an hour!"" ""We are thinking,"" replied his wife, ""of the pattern for the wedding gown. If she is to marry Tom, the gown must, of course, be a pretty one, and the choice of the right pattern is, indeed, an important matter."" ""To be sure!"" answered her husband, seating himself on the floor beside them to consider the same subject. As at length Tom grew tired of waiting, he went himself into the cellar to see if anything unusual had happened. He found the whole family sitting on the floor and looking extremely thoughtful. ""Why do you all sit here?"" he asked. At length the farmer, aroused from his reverie, proceeded to relate the difficult question which had caught their attention. ""Yes, in dee e ed,"" answered Tom. ""Which will be the most suitable pattern? You may think of that until I return, and in the meantime I will do the same. Good bye to you!"" Mounting his horse, he rode home as rapidly as the steed would carry him, and if he has not found another and less thoughtful girl, he is yet a bachelor. But the three people may yet be sitting on the cellar floor, thinking of the pattern for the bridal gown, for all that I know! Return to D. L.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Bewitched Brothers,"This woman had two sons and one daughter. The two boys came in just at the moment when the loaves of dough were on the shovel. They were so hungry that they did not wait for the dough to be baked, and before their mother had time to put the shovel into the oven they got hold of the dough, raw and uncooked as it was, and ate it up to the smallest bit. They did not leave even a little piece for their mother and sister. When the mother saw the terrible greediness of her children, and that they ate the raw stuff and did not leave even a small piece for her or their sister, she cursed them and said, ""May you be cursed by God and be changed into two birds; may you haunt the highest peaks of the mountains; may you never be able to eat bread even when you see it, because you did not leave any for me this day."" No sooner had the boys gone out of the house than they were changed into two huge eagles, who, spreading their wings, flew away to the ends of the earth, no one knowing whither they had gone. A short time afterwards their sister, who had not been at home when all this had happened, came in, and she asked the mother where her brothers were. Her mother did not tell her what had happened, and said that the brothers, finding it was impossible for them to live any longer here, had gone out into the wide world to live by their own earnings. When the girl heard this she wept, and said, ""If that be so, then I will also go out into the wide world, and will seek my brothers until I find them,"" and would not listen to the words of her mother, who wanted to keep her back. She said good-bye and departed, and traveled on and on for a long time, until she came to the ends of the earth, where the sun and moon no longer shone, and the days were dark. So she fell a-praying, and said, ""I have gone in search of my brothers; O God, help me,"" and as she turned round she saw a forest full of high trees which she had not noticed before, and she said to herself, ""I will go into that forest; I am sure nothing will happen to me,"" and so she did. She went into the forest not knowing where she was going. In the midst of it she saw a beautiful meadow full of singing birds, and there was a huge castle surrounded by thick walls and closed by a gate with six locks. At the entrance of the gate there were two huge monsters. She was very frightened. Still she watched until these monsters had fallen asleep, and then slipping past them she entered the gates. There she was met by a fox, who said to her, ""What has brought thee hither into this the other world from the world outside? I fear our master will eat you up. As soon as he comes home he will swallow you."" Still she went on, and on entering the house she met the mistress of the house, who asked her the same question, and she told her what had happened to her from the beginning to the end, and that she had gone out into the wide world to seek for her lost brothers. When the mistress heard her tale she took pity on her, and taking her into the innermost chamber she hid he there, and then went to await the homecoming of the master. About midday, when the sun stands on the crossways of heaven, there was a great noise in the house; the place shook, for the master had come, and he was none other than a huge lion. At table, the mistress said to him, ""O my master, thou hast always been so good to me; I ask you to be once more good and kind; promise me."" And he promised, and asked her her request. She told him what had happened to that girl, and said that she had come there from the other world in search of her brothers. The lion called the young girl, who was greatly frightened, and she told him again all that had happened to her. He then said, ""I will call together all my subjects and ask them whether they have seen your brothers passing by this way, or whether meeting them they have eaten them."" So he called from far and near all the animals who were in his dominion, and he asked them about the brothers. But they all said that these had never passed through the land, and they had neither seen them nor eaten them. So the lion told her to go on. She went on and came to another forest, very big and dark, and waling for a time in it she came to another meadow full of birds singing so beautifully that you could not hear enough of them, and there in the midst was a house deep down in the ground with a thatched roof. The girl went in the house, and there was an old woman sitting on the oven. ""May God help you,"" said the young girl, and the old woman replied, ""Welcome, my daughter, what has brought you here into this part of the world never yet trodden by human foot?"" And the girl told her that she had left her mother's house and gone in search of her brothers. The woman said, ""Your brothers are alive, but they are under a spell, for they have been charmed into huge birds, and they live yonder in the castle on that steep mountain. If you can reach that place you will be able to see your brothers."" Full of joy at these tidings, the girl went to the mountain and found that it was a bare, steep, high cliff with little patches of grass here and there, just the place for eagles' nests. taking courage, she started climbing up, and after endless toil reached the top. There she saw a huge palace surrounded by iron walls, and going inside she saw a room; the table was set and food was on the table. As she was very hungry, she went round the table and took a bit from every dish. Then she hid herself, watching to see what would happen. She had not to wait very long, for soon two huge eagles came from the depths of heaven. They entered and sat down at the table and began to eat their meal. Suddenly one of them said to the other, ""Halloo, someone must have been here, for I see that my food has been nibbled."" The other said, ""It is impossible for anyone to come here,"" and took no further notice of it. On the second day they noticed that once again some of their food had been eaten again, and so on the third day, when more of it had been eaten. So they started hunting through the house to find out who was hidden there, for surely someone must have come to eat the food. After a long search they found the girl huddled up in a small room. As soon as they saw her they recognized her as their sister, and taking her into the large hall they asked her what had happened and what had brought her to them. She told them all that had happened to her, and how she had been through the forest and climbed up the mountain, and that she was now there with them. The brothers then said to her, ""We are under a spell; mother has cursed us. We have now been changed into birds of prey; but if you will stay here for six years and not speak a single word, that will save us; the spell will be broken, and we shall again be human beings."" The girl promised to do all they wished, as the old woman whom she had met before had told her that she was to do whatever her brothers would wish he to do. And there she remained. Her brothers spread their wings and flew away. Five years had passed, the girl no seeing anything of them, and not speaking all the time. After that time she said to herself, ""What is the good of my sitting here and keeping silent when none of them have come; perchance they are dead, or who know what has happened?"" No sooner had she opened her mouth and spoken a word when in came her two brothers, and said to her mournfully, ""Thou hast not kept thy vow, thou hast broken thy promise, thou hast spoken! If thou wouldst have waited one more year we would have become human beings, and the spell would have been broken. Now we are cursed forever. We must remain eagles and birds of prey."" And so they have remained to this day, preying on birds and beasts, living on raw meat, never being able to touch bread, and even picking up children under six years of age, the years which their sister had to wait in order to break the spell.",Romania,"Source: M.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Curse of the Seven Children,"Now it happened that the king had to go away to war; and before departing he said to the queen, ""Listen. If you have a son, hang a lance out of the window; if a daughter, a distaff; so that I can see as soon as I arrive which it is."" After the king had been gone a month, the queen gave birth to the most beautiful girl that was ever seen. Imagine how pleased the queen was at having a girl. She could scarcely contain herself for joy, and immediately gave orders to hang the distaff out of the window; but in the midst of the joyful confusion, a mistake was made, and they put out a lance. Shortly after, the king returned and saw the sign at the window, and cursed all his seven sons; but when he entered the house and the servants crowded around him to congratulate him and tell him about his beautiful daughter, then the king was amazed and became very melancholy. He entered the queen's room and looked at the child, who seemed exactly like one of those wax dolls to be kept in a box; then he looked about him and saw nothing of his sons, and his eyes filled with tears, for those poor youths had wandered out into the world. Meanwhile the girl grew, and when she was large she saw that her parents caressed her, but always with tears in their eyes. One day she said to her mother, ""What is the matter with you, mother, that I always see you crying?"" Then, the queen told her the story, and said that she was afraid that some day she would see her disappear too. When the girl heard how it was, what did she do? One night she rose softly and left the palace, with the intention of going to find her brothers. She walked and walked, and at last met a little old man, who said to her, ""Where are you going at this time of the night?"" She answered, ""I am in search of my brothers."" The old man said, ""It will be difficult to find them, for you must not speak for seven years, seven months, seven weeks, seven days, seven hours, and seven minutes."" She said, ""I will try."" Then she took a bit of paper which she found on the ground, wrote on it the day and the hour with a piece of charcoal, and left the old man and hastened on her way. After she had run a long time, she saw a light and went towards it, and when she was near it, she saw that it was over the door of a palace where a king lived. She entered and sat down on the stairway, and fell asleep. The servants came later to put out the light, and saw the pretty girl asleep on the stone steps; they awakened her, asking her what she was doing there. She began to make signs, asking them to give her a lodging. They understood her, and said they would ask the king. They returned shortly to tell her to enter, for the king wished to see her before she was shown to her room. When the king saw the beautiful girl, with hair like gold, flesh like milk and wine, teeth white as pearls, and little hands that an artist could not paint as beautiful as they were, he suddenly imagined that she must be the daughter of some lord, and gave orders that she should be treated with all possible respect. They showed her to a beautiful room; then a maid came and undressed her and put her to bed. Next morning, Diana, for so she was called, arose, saw a frame with a piece of embroidery in it, and began to work at it. The king visited her, and asked if she needed anything, and she made signs that she did not. The king was so pleased with the young girl that he ended by falling in love with her, and after a year had passed he thought of marrying her. The queen mother, who was an envious person, was not content with the match, because, said she, no one knows where she came from, and, besides, she is dumb, something that would make people wonder if a king should marry her. But the king was so obstinate that he married her; and when his mother saw that there was no help, she pretended to be satisfied. Shortly after, the queen mother put into the king's hands a letter which informed him of an imminent war, in which, if he did not take part, he would run the risk of losing his realm. The king went to the war, in fact, with great grief at leaving his wife; and before departing, he commended her earnestly to his mother, who said, ""Do not be anxious, my son, I shall do all that I can to make her happy."" The king embraced his wife and mother, and departed. Scarcely had the king gone when the queen mother sent for a mason, and made him build a wall near the kitchen sink, so that it formed a sort of box. Now you must know that Diana expected soon to become a mother, and this afforded the queen mother a pretext to write to her son that his wife had died in giving birth to a child. She took her and put her in the wall she had had built, where there was neither light nor air, and where the wicked woman hoped that she would die. But it was not so. The scullion went every day to wash the dishes at the sink near where poor Diana was buried alive. While attending to his business, he heard a lamentation, and listened to see where it could come from. He listened and listened, until at last he perceived that the voice came from the wall that had been newly built. What did he do then? He made a hole in the wall, and saw that the queen was there. The scullion asked how she came there; but she only made signs that she was about to give birth to a child. The poor scullion had his wife make a fine cushion, on which Diana reposed as well as she could, and gave birth to the most beautiful boy that could be seen. The scullion's wife went to see her every moment, and carried her broth, and cared for the child; in short, this poor woman, as well as her husband, did everything she could to alleviate the poor queen, who tried to make them understand by signs what she needed. One day it came into Diana's head to look into her memorandum book and see how long she still had to keep silent, and she saw that only two minutes yet remained. As soon as they had passed, she told the scullion all that had happened. At that moment the king arrived, and the scullion drew the queen from out the hole, and showed her to the king. You can imagine how delighted he was to see again his Diana, whom he believed to be dead. He embraced her, and kissed her and the child; in short, such was his joy that it seemed as if he would go mad. Diana related everything to him: why she had left her home, and why she had played dumb so long, and finally how she had been treated by the queen mother, and what she had suffered, and how kind those poor people had been to her. When he had heard all this, he said, ""Leave the matter to me; I will arrange it."" The next day the king invited all the nobles and princes of his realm to a great banquet. Now it happened that in setting the tables the servants laid six plates besides the others; and when the guests sat down, six handsome youths entered, who advanced and asked what should be given to a sister who had done so and so for her brothers. Then the king sprang up and said, ""And I ask what shall be done to a mother who did so and so to her son's wife?"" and he explained everything. One said, ""Burn her alive."" Another, ""Put her in the pillory."" Another, ""Fry her in oil in the public square."" This was agreed to. The youths had been informed by that same old man whom Diana had met, and who was a magician, where their sister was and what she had done for them. Then they made themselves known, and embraced Diana and their brother-in-law the king, and after the greatest joy, they all started off to see their parents. Imagine the satisfaction of the king and queen at seeing again all their seven children. They gave the warmest reception to the king, Diana's husband, and after they had spent some days together, Diana returned with her husband to their city. And all lived there afterward in peace and contentment.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 11, pp. 54-57.",NA,NA
The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Little Sister: The Story of Suyettar and the Nine Brothers,"""Why haven't we a little sister?"" they kept asking. ""Do give us a little sister!"" When the time came that another child was to be born, they said to their mother, ""If the baby is a boy we are going away and you will never see us again, but if it is a little girl then we shall stay home and take care of it."" The mother agreed that if the child were a girl she would have her husband put a spindle outside on the gatepost and, if it were a boy, an ax. ""Just wait,"" she said, ""and see what your father puts on the gatepost and then you will know whether it is another brother God has sent you or a little sister."" The baby turned out to be a girl and the mother was overjoyed. ""Hurry, husband!"" she cried, ""and put a spindle on the gatepost so that our nine sons may know the good news!"" The man did so and then quickly returned to the mother and baby. The moment he was gone Suyettar slipped up and changed the tokens. She took away the spindle and put in its place an ax. Then with an evil grin she hurried off mumbling to herself, ""Now we'll see what we'll see!"" She hoped to bring trouble and grief and she succeeded. As soon as the nine sons saw the ax on the gatepost they thought their mother had given birth to another son and at once they left home vowing never to return. The poor mother waited for them and waited. ""What is keeping my sons?"" she cried at last. ""Go out to the gate, husband, and see if they are coming."" The man went out and soon returned bringing back word that someone had changed the tokens. ""The spindle that I put on the gatepost is gone,"" he said, ""and in its place is an ax."" ""Alas!"" cried the poor mother, ""some evil creature has done this to spite us! Oh, if we could only get word to our sons of the little sister they were so eager to have!"" But there was no way to reach them for no one knew the way they had gone. In a short time the husband died and the poor woman, abandoned by her nine sons, had only her little daughter left. She named the child Kerttu. Kerttu was a dear little girl and her face was as beautiful as her heart was good. Whenever she found her mother weeping alone she tried to comfort her and, as she grew older, she wanted to know the cause of her mother's grief. At last the mother told her about her nine brothers and how they had gone away never to return owing to the trick of some evil creature. ""My poor mother!"" she cried, ""how sorry I am that I am the innocent cause of your loss! Let me go out into the world and find my brothers! When once they hear the truth they will gladly come home to you to care for you in your old age!"" At first the mother would not consent to this. ""You are all I have,"" she said, ""and I should indeed be miserable and lonely if anything happened you!"" But Kerttu continued to weep every time she thought of her poor brothers driven unnecessarily from home and at last the mother, realizing that she would nevermore be happy unless she were allowed to go in search of them, gave up opposing her. ""Very well, my daughter, you may go and may God go with you and bring you safely back to me. But before you go I must prepare you a bag of food for the journey and bake you a magic cake that will show you the way."" So she baked a batch of bread and at the same time mixed a little round cake with Kerttu's own tears and baked it, too. Then she said, ""Here now, my child, are provisions for the journey and here is a magic cake that will lead you to your brothers. All you have to do is throw it down in front of you and say: Now it happened that Kerttu had a little dog, Musti, that she loved dearly. ""I'll take Musti with me!"" she said. ""Musti will protect me!"" So she called Musti and Musti wagged his tail and barked with joy at the prospect of going out into the world with his mistress. Then Kerttu threw down the magic cake in front of her and sang: Their first day was without adventure. When night came they ate their supper and went to sleep in a field under a tree. The second day they overtook an ugly old woman whom Kerttu disliked on sight. But she said to herself, ""Shame on you, Kerttu, not liking this woman just because she's old and ugly!"" and she made herself answer the old woman's greetings politely, and she made Musti stop snarling and growling. The old hag asked Kerttu who she was and where she was going and Kerttu told her. ""Ah!"" said the old woman, ""how fortunate that we have met each other for our ways lie together!"" She smiled and petted Kerttu's arm and Kerttu felt like shuddering. But she restrained herself and told herself severely, ""You're a wicked girl not to feel more friendly to the poor old thing!"" Musti felt much as Kerttu did. He no longer growled for Kerttu had told him not to, but he drooped his tail between his legs and, pressing up close to Kerttu, he trembled with fright. And well he might, too, for the old hag was none other than Suyettar who had been waiting all these years just for this very chance to do further injury to Kerttu and her brothers. Kerttu, poor child, was, alas! too good and innocent to suspect evil in others. She said to Suyettar, ""Very well, if our ways lie together then we can be companions."" So Suyettar joined Kerttu and Musti and the three of them walked on following the little cake. As the day advanced the sun grew hotter and hotter and at last when they reached a lake Suyettar said, ""My dear, let us sit down here for a few moments and rest."" They all sat down and presently Suyettar said, ""Let us go bathing in the lake. That will refresh us."" Kerttu would have agreed if Musti had not tugged at her skirts and warned her not to. ""Don't do it, dear mistress!"" Musti growled softly. ""Don't go in bathing with her! She'll bewitch you!"" So Kerttu said, ""No, I don't want to go in bathing."" Suyettar waited until they were again journeying on and then when Kerttu wasn't looking she turned around and kicked Musti and broke one of the poor little dog's legs. Thereafter Musti had to hop along on three legs. The next afternoon when they passed another lake, Suyettar tried again to tempt Kerttu into the water. ""The sun is very hot,"" she said, ""and it would refresh us both to bathe. Come, Kerttu, my dear, don't refuse me this time!"" But again Musti tugged at Kerttu's skirts and, licking her hand, whispered the warning, ""Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!"" So again Kerttu said politely, ""No, I don't feel like going in bathing. You go in alone and I'll wait for you here."" But this was not what Suyettar wanted and she said, no, she didn't care to go in alone. She was furious, too, with Musti and later when Kerttu wasn't looking she gave the poor little dog a kick that broke another leg. Thereafter Musti had to hop along on two legs. They slept the third night by the wayside and the next day they went on again always following the magic cake. In midafternoon they passed a lake and Suyettar said: ""Surely, my dear, you must be tired and hot. Let us both bathe in this cool lake."" But Musti, hopping painfully along on two legs, yelped weakly and said to Kerttu, ""Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she'll bewitch you!"" So for a third time Kerttu refused and later, when she wasn't looking, Suyettar kicked Musti and broke the third of the poor little dog's legs. Thereafter Musti hopped on as best he could on only one leg, Well, they went on and on. When night came they slept by the roadside and then next morning they started on again. The sun grew hot and by midafternoon Kerttu was tired and ready to rest. When they reached a lake Suyettar again begged that they both go in bathing. Kerttu was tempted to agree when poor Musti threw himself panting at her feet and whimpered, ""Don't do it, dear mistress! Don't go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!"" So Kerttu again refused. ""That's right, dear mistress!"" Musti panted, ""don't do it! I shall soon be dead, I know, for she hates me, but before I die I want to warn you one last time never to go in bathing with her or she will bewitch you!"" ""What's that dog saying?"" Suyettar demanded angrily, and without waiting for an answer she picked up a heavy piece of wood and struck poor Musti such a blow on the head that it killed him. ""What have you done to my poor little dog?"" Kerttu cried. ""Don't mind him, my dear,"" Suyettar said. ""He was sick and lame and it was better to put him out of his misery."" Suyettar tried to soothe Kerttu and make her forget Musti but all afternoon Kerttu wept to think that she would never again see her faithful little friend. The next afternoon when Suyettar begged her to go in bathing there was no Musti to warn her against it and at last Kerttu allowed herself to be persuaded. She was tired from her many days' wandering and it was true that the first touch of the cool water refreshed her. ""Now splash water in my face!"" Suyettar cried. But Kerttu didn't want to splash water into Suyettar's face for she supposed Suyettar was an old woman and she thought it would be disrespectful to splash water into the face of an old woman. ""Do you hear me!"" screamed Suyettar. When Kerttu still hesitated, Suyettar looked at her with such a terrible, threatening expression that Kerttu did as she was bidden. She splashed water into Suyettar's face and, as the water touched Suyettar's eyes, Suyettar cried out: ""Oh, why,"" Kerttu cried, ""why didn't I heed poor Musti's warning!"" Suyettar dragged her roughly out of the water. ""Come along!"" she said. ""Dress yourself in those rags of mine and start that cake a-rolling! We ought to reach your brothers' house by tonight."" So poor Kerttu had to dress herself in Suyettar's filthy old garments while Suyettar, looking like a fresh young girl, decked herself out in Kerttu's pretty bodice and skirt. Unwillingly now and with a heavy heart Kerttu threw down the cake and said: The little cake led them at last to a farmhouse before which it stopped. This was where the nine brothers were living. Eight of them were out working in the fields but the youngest was at home. He opened the door and when Suyettar told him that she was Kerttu, his sister, he kissed her tenderly and made her welcome. Then he invited her inside and they sat side by side on the bench and talked and Suyettar told him all she had heard from Kerttu about his mother and about the tokens which had been changed at Kerttu's birth. The youngest brother listened eagerly and Suyettar told her story so glibly that of course he supposed that she was his own true sister. ""And who is the awful looking old hag that has come with you?"" he asked pointing at Kerttu. ""That? Oh, that's an old serving woman whom our mother sent with me to bear me company. She's dumb and foolish but she's a good herd and we can let her drive the cow out to pasture every day."" The older brothers when they came home were greatly pleased to find what they thought was their sister. They began to love her at once and to pet her and they said that now she must stay with them and keep house for them. She told them that was what she wanted to do and she said that now she was here the youngest brother need no longer stay at home but could go out every morning with the rest of them to work in the fields. So now began a new life for poor Kerttu. In the morning after the brothers were gone Suyettar would scold and abuse her. She would bake a cake for her dinner to be eaten in the fields and she would fill the cake with stones and sticks and filth. Then she would take Kerttu as far as the gate where she would give her back her tongue and her memory and order her roughly to drive the cow to pasture and look after it all day long. In the late afternoon when Kerttu drove home the cow, Suyettar would meet her at the gate and take from her her tongue and her memory and then in the evening the brothers would see her as a foolish old woman who couldn't talk. Every morning and every evening Kerttu begged Suyettar to show her a little mercy, but far from showing her any mercy Suyettar grew more cruel from day to day. Suyettar was very proud to think that nine handsome young men took her for a beautiful girl and she felt sure they would never find out their mistake for only Kerttu knew who she really was and Kerttu was entirely in her power. At night seated in the shadow in a far corner of the kitchen with her nine brothers laughing and talking Kerttu felt no sorrow for at such times of course she had no memory. But during the day it was different. Then when she was alone in the meadow she had her memory and her tongue and she thought about her poor mother at home anxiously awaiting her return and she thought of her nine sturdy brothers all of whom might now through her mistake fall victims to Suyettar. These thoughts made her weep with grief and as the days went by she put this grief into a song which she sang constantly: ""Strange!"" they said to one another. ""Can that be the old woman singing? In the evening at home she never opens her mouth and our dear sister always says that she's dumb and foolish."" One afternoon when Kerttu's song sounded particularly sad, the youngest brother, crept close to the meadow where Kerttu was sitting in order to hear the words. He listened carefully and then hurried back to the others and with frightened face told them what he had heard. ""Nonsense I"" the older brothers said. ""It can't be so!"" However, they, too, wanted to hear for themselves the words of the strange song, so they all crept near to listen. It looked like an old hag who was singing but the voice that came out of the withered mouth was the voice of a young girl. As they listened they, too, grew pale: ""It is well for us,"" they said, ""if we do not all fall into the power of that awful creature! How, O how can we rescue our poor little sister!"" ""I can never get back my own looks,"" Kerttu said, ""unless Suyettar splashes water into my eyes and unless I cry out a magic rhyme as she does it."" The brothers discussed one plan after another and at last agreed on one that they thought might deceive Suyettar. They had Kerttu inflame her eyes with dust and come groping home one midday. The brothers, too, were at home and as Kerttu came stumbling into the kitchen they said to Suyettar, ""Oh, sister, sister, see the poor old woman! Something ails her! Her eyes -- they're all red and swollen! Get some water and bathe them!"" ""Nonsense!"" Suyettar said. ""The old hag's well enough! Let her be! She doesn't need any attention!"" ""Oh, sister!"" the youngest brother said, reproachfully, ""is that any way for a human, kindhearted girl like you to talk? If you won't bathe the old creature's eyes, I will myself!"" Then Suyettar who of course wanted them to think that she was a human, kindhearted girl said, no, she would bathe them. So she took a basin of water over to Kerttu and told her to lean down her head. As she splashed the first drop of water into Kerttu's eyes, Kerttu cried out: Then one of the brothers said to Suyettar, ""Sister dear, the sauna is all heated and ready. Don't you want to bathe?"" Suyettar thought that this would be a fine chance to wash the dust from her eyes, so she let them lead her to the sauna. Once they got her inside they locked the door and set the sauna afire. Oh, the noise she made then when she found she had been trapped! She kicked and screamed and cursed and threatened! But Kerttu and the brothers paid no heed to her. They left her burning in the sauna while they hurried homewards. They found their poor old mother seated at the window weeping, for she thought that now Kerttu as well as her sons was lost forever. As Kerttu and the nine handsome young men came in the gate she didn't recognize them until Kerttu sang out:",Finland,"Source: Parker Fillmore, Mighty Mikko: A Book of Finnish Fairy Tales and Folk Tales (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1922), pp. 99-120.","This story differs from most type 451 folktales in that here the sister, not her brothers, is bewitched.",NA
The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Seven Doves,"And when they had changed their first teeth, they said to Jannetella their mother, ""Hark ye, mother, if, after so many sons, you do not this time have a daughter, we are resolved to leave home, and go wandering through the world like the sons of the blackbirds."" When their mother heard this sad announcement, she prayed Heaven to remove such an intention from her sons, and prevent her losing seven such jewels as they were. But the sons said to Jannetella, ""We will retire to the top of yonder hill or rock opposite; if Heaven sends you another son, put an inkstand and a pen up at the window; but if you have a little girl, put up a spoon and a distaff. For if we see the signal of a daughter, we shall return home and spend the rest of our lives under your wings; but if we see the signal of a son, then forget us, for you may know that we have taken ourselves off."" Soon after the sons had departed it pleased Heaven that Jannetella should have given her a pretty little daughter; then she told the nurse to make the signal to the brothers, but the woman was so stupid and confused that she put up the inkstand and the pen. As soon as the seven brothers saw this signal, they set off, and walked on and on, until at the end of three years they came to a wood, where the trees were performing the sword-dance to the sound of a river which made counterpoint upon the stones. In this wood was the house of an ogre, whose eyes having been blinded whilst asleep by a woman, he was such an enemy to the sex that he devoured all whom he could catch. When the youths arrived at the ogre's house, tired out with walking and exhausted with hunger, they begged him for pity's sake to give them a morsel of bread. And the ogre replied, that if they would serve him, he would give them food, and they would have nothing else to do but to watch over him, like a dog, each in turn for a day. The youths, upon hearing this, thought they had found mother and father; so they consented, and remained in the service of the ogre, who having gotten their names by heart, called one time Giangrazio, at another Cecchitiello, now Pascale, now Nuccio, now Pone, now Pezzillo, and now Carcavecchia, for so the brothers were named; and giving them a room in the lower part of his house, he allowed them enough to live upon. Meanwhile their sister had grown up; and hearing that her seven brothers, owing to the stupidity of the nurse, had set out to walk through the world, and that no tidings of them had ever been received, she took it into her head to go in search of them. And she begged and prayed her mother so long, that at last, overcome by her entreaties, she gave her leave to go, and dressed her like a pilgrim. Then the maiden walked and walked, asking at every place she came to whether anyone had seen seven brothers. And thus she journeyed on, until at length she got news of them at an inn, where having inquired the way to the wood, one morning, she arrived at the ogre's house, where she was recognized by her brothers with great joy, who cursed the inkstand and pen for writing falsely such misfortune for them. Then giving her a thousand caresses, they told her to remain quiet in their chamber, that the ogre might not see her; bidding her at the same time give a portion of whatever she had to eat to a cat which was in the room, or otherwise she would do her some harm. Cianna (for so the sister was named) wrote down this advice in the pocket-book of her heart, and shared everything with the cat, like a good companion, always cutting justly, and saying, ""This for me, this for thee, this for the daughter of the king!"" giving the cat a share to the last morsel. Now it happened one day that the brothers, going to hunt for the ogre, left Cianna a little basket of chickpeas to cook; and as she was picking them, by ill luck she found among them a hazelnut, which was the stone of disturbance to her quiet; for having swallowed it without giving half to the cat, the latter out of spite ran up to the hearth and put out the fire. Cianna seeing this, and not knowing what to do, left the room, contrary to the command of her brothers, and going into the ogre's chamber begged him for a little fire. Then the ogre, hearing a woman's voice, said, ""Welcome, madam! Wait a while, you have found what you are seeking."" And so saying he took a Genoa stone, and daubing it with oil he fell to whetting his tusks. But Cianna, who saw that she had made a mistake, seizing a lighted stick, ran to her chamber; and bolting the door inside, she placed against it bars, stools, bedsteads, tables, stones, and everything there was in the room. As soon as the ogre had put an edge on his teeth he ran to the chamber of the brothers, and finding the door fastened, he fell to kicking it to break it open. At this noise and disturbance the seven brothers came home, and hearing themselves accused by the ogre of treachery for making their chamber the abode of his women-enemies, Giangrazio, who was the eldest and had more sense than the others, and saw matters going badly, said to the ogre, ""We know nothing of this affair, and it may be that this wicked woman has perchance come into the room whilst we were at the chase; but as she has fortified herself inside, come with me, and I will take you to a place where we can seize her without her being able to defend herself."" Then they took the ogre by the hand, and led him to a deep, deep pit, where giving him a push they sent him headlong to the bottom; and taking a shovel, which they found on the ground, they covered him with earth. Then they bade their sister unfasten the door, and they rated her soundly for the fault she had committed, and the danger in which she had placed herself; telling her to be more careful in future, and to beware of plucking grass upon the spot where the ogre was buried, or they would be turned into seven doves. ""Heaven keep me from bringing such a misfortune upon you!"" replied Cianna. So taking possession of all the ogre's goods and chattels, and making themselves masters of the whole house, they lived there merrily enough, waiting until winter should pass away. Now it happened one day, when the brothers were gone to the mountains to get firewood, to defend themselves against the cold, which increased from day to day, that a poor pilgrim came to the ogre's wood, and made faces at an ape that was perched up in a pine tree; whereupon the ape threw down one of the fir apples from the tree upon the man's pate, which made such a terrible bump that the poor fellow set up a loud cry. Cianna hearing the noise went out, and taking pity on his disaster, she quickly plucked a sprig of rosemary from a tuft which grew upon the ogre's grave; then she made him a plaster of it with chewed bread and salt, and after giving the man some breakfast she sent him away. Whilst Cianna was laying the cloth, and expecting her brothers, lo! she saw seven doves come flying, who said to her, ""Ah! better that your hand had been cut off, you cause of all our misfortune, ere it plucked that accursed rosemary and brought such a calamity upon us! Have you eaten the brains of a cat, O sister, that you have driven our advice from your mind? Behold us turned to birds, a prey to the talons of kites, hawks, and falcons! Behold us made companions of water-hens, snipes, goldfinches, woodpeckers, jays, owls, magpies, jackdaws, rooks, starlings, woodcocks, cocks, hens and chickens, turkey-cocks, blackbirds, thrushes, chaffinches, tomtits, jenny-wrens, lapwings, linnets, greenfinches, crossbills, flycatchers, larks, plovers, kingfishers, wagtails, redbreasts, red finches, sparrows, ducks, fieldfares, wood-pigeons and bullfinches! A rare thing you have done! And now we may return to our country to find nets laid and twigs limed for us! To heal the head of a pilgrim, you have broken the heads of seven brothers; nor is there any help for our misfortune, unless you find the Mother of Time, who will tell you the way to get us out of trouble."" Cianna, looking like a plucked quail at the fault she had committed, begged pardon of her brothers, and offered to go round the world until she should find the dwelling of the old woman. Then praying them not to stir from the house until she returned, lest any ill should betide them, she set out, and journeyed on and on without ever tiring; and though she went on foot, her desire to aid her brothers served her as a sumpter-mule, with which she made three miles an hour. At last she came to the seashore, where with the blows of the waves the sea was banging the rocks. Here she saw a huge whale, who said to her, ""My pretty maiden, what go you seeking?"" And she replied, ""I am seeking the dwelling of the Mother of Time."" ""Hear then what you must do,"" replied the whale. ""Go straight along this shore, and on coming to the first river, follow it up to its source, and you will meet with someone who will show you the way. But do me one kindness. When you find the good old woman, beg of her the favor to tell me some means by which I may swim about safely, without so often knocking upon the rocks and being thrown on the sands."" ""Trust to me,"" said Cianna. Then thanking the whale for pointing out the way, she set off walking along the shore; and after a long journey she came to the river, which was disbursing itself into the sea. Then taking the way up to its source, she arrived at a beautiful open country, where the meadow vied with the heaven, displaying her green mantle starred over with flowers. And there she met a mouse, who said to her, ""Whither are you going thus alone, my pretty girl?"" And Cianna replied, ""I am seeking the Mother of Time."" ""You have a long way to go,"" said the mouse; ""but do not lose heart. Everything has an end. Walk on therefore toward yon mountains, and you will soon have more news of what you are seeking. But do me one favor. When you arrive at the house you wish to find, get the good old woman to tell you what we can do to get rid of the tyranny of the cats; then command me, and I am your slave."" Cianna, after promising to do the mouse this kindness, set off toward the mountains, which, although they appeared to be close at hand, seemed never to be reached. But having come to them at length, she sat down tired out upon a stone; and there she saw an army of ants carrying a large store of grain, one of whom turning to Cianna said, ""Who art thou, and whither art thou going?"" And Cianna, who was courteous to everyone, said to her, ""I am an unhappy girl, who for a matter that concerns me am seeking the dwelling of the Mother of Time."" ""Go on farther,"" replied the ant, ""and where these mountains open into a large plain you will obtain more news. But do me a great favor. Set the secret from the old woman what we ants can do to live a little longer; for it seems to me a folly in worldly affairs to be heaping up such a large store of food for so short a life."" ""Be at ease,"" said Cianna. ""I will return the kindness you have shown me."" Then she passed the mountains and arrived at a wide plain; and proceeding a little way over it, she came to a large oak tree, whose fruit tasted like sweetmeats to the maiden, who was satisfied with little. Then the oak, making lips of its bark and a tongue of its pith, said to Cianna, ""Whither are you going so sad, my little daughter? Come and rest under my shade."" Cianna thanked him much, but excused herself, saying that she was going in haste to find the Mother of Time. And when the oak heard this he replied, ""You are not far from her dwelling; for before you have gone another day's journey you will see upon a mountain a house, in which you will find her whom you seek. But if you have as much kindness as beauty, I prithee learn for me what I can do to regain my lost honor; for instead of being food for great men, I am now only made the food of hogs."" ""Leave that to me,"" replied Cianna. ""I will take care to serve you."" So saying she departed, and walking on and on without ever resting, she came at length to the foot of an impertinent mountain, which was poking its head into the face of the clouds. There she found an old man, who wearied and way-worn had lain down upon some hay. And as soon as he saw Cianna, he knew her at once, and that it was she who had cured his bump. When the old man heard what she was seeking, he told her that he was carrying to Time the rent for the piece of earth which he had cultivated, and that Time was a tyrant who usurped everything in the world, claiming tribute from all, and especially from people of his age; and he added that, having received kindness from Cianna, he would now return it a hundredfold, by giving her some good information about her arrival at the mountain; and that he was sorry he could not accompany her thither, since his old age, which was condemned rather to go down than up, obliged him to remain at the foot of those mountains, to cast up accounts with the clerks of Time, which are the labors, the sufferings, and the infirmities of life, and to pay the debt of Nature. So the old man said to her, ""Now, my pretty innocent child, listen to me. You must know that on the top of this mountain you will find a ruined house, which was built long ago time out of mind; the walls are cracked, the foundations crumbling away, the doors worm eaten, the furniture all worn out, and in short everything is gone to wrack and ruin. On one side are seen shattered columns, on another broken statues, and nothing is left in a good state except a coat-of-arms over the door, quartered, on which you will see a serpent biting its tail, a stag, a raven, and a phoenix. When you enter, you will see on the ground files, saws, scythes, sickles, pruning-hooks, and hundreds and hundreds of vessels full of ashes, with the names written on them, like gallipots in an apothecary's shop; and there may be read Corinth, Saguntum, Carthage, Troy, and a thousand other cities, the ashes of which Time preserves as trophies of his conquests. When you come near the house, hide yourself until Time goes out; and as soon as he has gone forth, enter, and you will find an old, old woman, with a beard that touches the ground and a hump reaching to the sky. Her hair, like the tail of a dapple-gray horse, covers her heels; her face looks like a plaited collar, with the folds stiffened by the starch of years. The old woman is seated upon a clock, which is fastened to a wall; and her eyebrows are so large that they overshadow her eyes, so that she will not be able to see you. As soon as you enter, quickly take the weights off the clock; then call to the old woman, and beg her to answer your questions; whereupon she will instantly call her son to come and eat you up; but the clock upon which the old woman sits having lost its weights, her son cannot move, and she will therefore be obliged to tell you what you wish. But do not trust any oath she may make, unless she swear by the wings of her son. Then give faith to her, and do what she tells you, and you will be content."" So saying, the poor old man fell down and crumbled away, like a dead body brought from a catacomb to the light of day. Then Cianna took the ashes, and mixing them with a pint of tears, she made a grave and buried them, praying Heaven to grant them quiet and repose. And ascending the mountain, till she was quite out of breath, she waited until Time came out, who was an old man with a long, long beard, and who wore a very old cloak covered with slips of paper, on which were worked the names of various people. He had large wings, and ran so fast that he was out of sight in an instant. When Cianna entered the house of his mother, she started with affright at the sight of that black old chip; and instantly seizing the weights of the clock, she told what she wanted to the old woman, who setting up a loud cry called to her son. But Cianna said to her, ""You may butt your head against the wall as long as you like, for you will not see your son whilst I hold these clock-weights."" Thereupon the old woman, seeing herself foiled, began to coax Cianna, saying, ""Let go of them, my dear, and do not stop my son's course; for no man living has ever done that. Let go of them, and may Heaven preserve you! for I promise you by the aquafortis of my son, with which he corrodes everything, that I will do you no harm."" ""That's time lost,"" answered Cianna. ""You must say something better if you would have me quit my hold."" ""I swear to you by those teeth which gnaw all mortal things, that I will tell you all you desire."" ""That is all nothing,"" answered Cianna; ""for I know you are deceiving me."" ""Well then,"" said the old woman, ""I swear to you by those wings which fly over all, that I will give you more pleasure than you imagine."" Thereupon Cianna, letting go the weights, kissed the old woman's hand, which had a moldy feel and a musty smell. And the old woman, seeing the courtesy of the damsel, said to her, ""Hide yourself behind this door, and when Time comes home I will make him tell me all you wish to know. And as soon as he goes out again, for he never stays quiet in one place, you can depart. But do not let yourself be heard or seen, for he is such a glutton that he does not spare even his own children; and when all fails, he devours himself, and then springs up anew."" Cianna did as the old woman told her, and lo! soon after Time came flying quick, quick, high, and light, and having gnawed whatever came to hand, down to the very moldiness upon the walls, he was about to depart, when his mother told him all she had heard from Cianna, beseeching him to answer exactly all her questions. After a thousand entreaties her son replied, ""To the tree may be answered, that it can never be prized by men so long as it keeps treasures buried under its roots To the mice, that they will never be safe from the cat, unless they tie a bell to her leg, to tell them when she is coming. To the ants, that they will live a hundred years, if they can dispense with flying; for when the ant is going to die she puts on wings. To the whale, that it should be of good cheer, and make friends with the sea-mouse, who will serve him as a guide, so that he will never go wrong. And to the doves, that when they alight on the column of wealth, they will return to their former state."" So saying, Time set out to run his accustomed post; and Cianna, taking leave of the old woman, descended to the foot of the mountain, just at the very time that the seven doves, who had followed their sister's footsteps, arrived there. Wearied with flying so far, they stopped to rest upon the horn of a dead ox; and no sooner had they alighted, than they were changed into handsome youths, as they were at first. But while they were marveling at this, they heard the reply which Time had given, and saw at once that the horn, as the symbol of plenty, was the column of wealth of which Time had spoken. Then embracing their sister with great joy, they all set out on the same road by which Cianna had come. And when they came to the oak tree, and told it what Cianna had heard from Time, the tree begged them to take away the treasure from its roots, since it was the cause why its acorns had lost their reputation. Thereupon the seven brothers, taking a spade which they found in a garden, dug and dug, until they came to a great heap of gold money, which they divided into eight parts, and shared among themselves and their sister, so that they might carry it away conveniently. But being wearied with the journey and the load, they laid themselves down to sleep under a hedge. Presently a band of robbers coming by, and seeing the poor fellows asleep, with their heads upon the cloths full of dollars, bound them hand and foot to some trees, and took away the money, leaving them to bewail not only their wealth, which had slipped through their fingers as soon as found, but their life; for being without hope of succor, they were in peril of either soon dying of starvation or allaying the hunger of some wild beast. As they were lamenting their unhappy lot, up came the mouse, who, as soon as she heard the reply which Time had given, in return for the good service nibbled the cords with which they were bound and set them free. And having gone a little way farther they met on the road the ant, who, when she heard the advice of Time, asked Cianna what was the matter, that she was so pale-faced and cast down. And when Cianna told her their misfortune, and the trick which the robbers had played them, the ant replied, ""Be quiet, I can now requite the kindness you have done me. You must know, that whilst I was carrying a load of grain underground, I saw a place where these dogs of assassins hide their plunder; they have made some holes under an old building, in which they shut up all the things they have stolen. They are just now gone out for some new robbery, and I will go with you and show you the place, so that you may recover your money."" So saying she took the way toward some tumble-down houses, and showed the seven brothers the mouth of a pit; whereupon Giangrazio, who was bolder than the rest, entering it, found there all the money of which they had been robbed. Then taking it with them, they set out, and walked towards the seashore, where they found the whale, and told him the good advice which Time -- who is the father of counsel -- had given them. And whilst they stood talking of their journey, and all that had befallen them, they saw the robbers suddenly appear, armed to the teeth, who had followed in their footsteps. At this sight they exclaimed, ""Alas, alas! we are now wholly lost, for here come the robbers armed, and they will not leave the skin on our bodies!"" ""Fear not,"" replied the whale,"" for I can save you out of the fire, and will thus requite the love you have shown me. So get upon my back, and I will quickly carry you to a place of safety."" Cianna and her brothers, seeing the foe at their heels and the water up to their throat, climbed upon the whale, who, keeping far off from the rocks, carried them to within sight of Naples; but being afraid to land them on account of the shoals and shallows, he said, ""Where would you like me to land you? On the shore of Amalfi? "" And Giangrazio answered, ""See whether that cannot be avoided, my dear fish; I do not wish to land at any place hereabouts; for at Massa they say barely good-day, at Sorrento thieves are plenty, at Vico they say you may go your way, at Castel-a-Mare no one says how are ye?"" Then the whale, to please them, turned about and went toward the Salt-Rock, where he left them; and they got put on shore by the first fishing boat that passed.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Seven Ravens,"The father sent one of the boys to run quickly to the well and get some water for the baptism. The other six ran along with him. Because each one of them wanted to be first one to dip out the water, the jug fell into the well. There they stood not knowing what to do, and not one of them dared to go home. When they did not return the father grew impatient, and said, ""They have forgotten what they went after because they were playing, those godless boys."" Fearing that the girl would die without being baptized, he cried out in anger, ""I wish that those boys would all turn into ravens."" He had hardly spoken these words when he heard a whirring sound above his head, and looking up, he saw seven coal-black ravens flying up and away. The parents could not take back the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they were still somewhat comforted because of their dear little daughter, who soon gained strength and became more beautiful every day. For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents took care not to mention them to her. However, one day she accidentally overheard some people talking about her. They said that she was beautiful enough, but that in truth she was to blame for her seven brothers' misfortune. This troubled her greatly, and she went to her father and mother and asked them if she indeed had had brothers, and what had happened to them. Her parents could no longer keep the secret, but said that it had been heaven's fate, and that her birth had been only the innocent cause. However, this ate at the girl's conscience every day, and she came to believe that she would have to redeem her brothers. She had neither rest nor peace until she secretly set forth and went out into the wide world, hoping to find her brothers and to set them free, whatever it might cost. She took nothing with her but a little ring as a remembrance from her parents, a loaf of bread for hunger, a little jug of water for thirst, and a little chair for when she got tired. She walked on and on -- far, far to the end of the world. She came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and ate little children. She hurried away, and ran to the moon, but it was much too cold, and also frightening and wicked, and when it saw the child, it said, ""I smell, smell human flesh."" Then she hurried away, and came to the stars, and they were friendly and good to her, each one sitting on its own little chair. When the morning star arose, it gave her a chicken bone, and said, ""Without that chicken bone you cannot open the glass mountain, and your brothers are inside the glass mountain."" The girl took the bone, wrapped it up well in a cloth, and went on her way again until she came to the glass mountain. The door was locked, and she started to take out the chicken bone, but when she opened up the cloth, it was empty. She had lost the gift of the good stars. What could she do now? She wanted to rescue her brothers, but she had no key to the glass mountain. The good little sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it into the door, and fortunately the door opened. After she had gone inside a little dwarf came up to her and said, ""My child, what are you looking for?"" ""I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,"" she replied. The dwarf said, ""The lord ravens are not at home, but if you want to wait here until they return, step inside."" Then the dwarf carried in the ravens' dinner on seven little plates, and in seven little cups. The sister ate a little bit from each plate and took a little sip from each cup. Into the last cup she dropped the ring that she had brought with her. Suddenly she heard a whirring and rushing sound in the air, and the dwarf said, ""The lord ravens are flying home now."" They came, wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their plates and cups. Then one after the other of them said, ""Who has been eating from my plate? Who has been drinking from my cup? It was a human mouth."" When the seventh one came to the bottom of his cup, the ring rolled toward him. Looking at it, he saw that it was a ring from their father and mother, and said, ""God grant that our sister might be here; then we would be set free."" The girl was listening from behind the door, and when she heard this wish she came forth. Then the ravens were restored to their human forms again. They hugged and kissed one another, and went home happily.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Die sieben Raben,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm [Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales], 7th ed., vol. 1 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterischen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 25, pp. 137-39.","The Grimms' source: The Hassenpflug family, and others.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Sister and Her Seven Brothers,"After their departure she gave birth to a little girl, and when this little girl was grown up a little she went one day to a neighbor's to amuse herself, and having played some childish trick the neighbor said to her, ""You will be a good one, you too, as your brothers have been."" The child goes home and says to her mother, ""Mother, have I some brothers?"" The mother says, ""Yes."" ""Where are they?"" ""Oh, gone off somewhere."" The daughter said to her, ""I must go too, then. Give me a piece of linen enough to make seven shirts."" And she would go off at once. The mother was very sorry for it, having already seven children away from home, and the only one she had wished to go away. She let her go then. This young girl went off, far, far, far away. She asks in a town if they know seven brothers who work together. They tell her, ""No."" She goes off to a mountain and asks there too, and they tell her in what house they live. She goes to this house, and sees that all the household work is to be done, and that there is nobody at home. She makes the beds, and cleans the whole house, and puts it in order. She prepares the dinner, and then hides herself in the dust-hole. Her brothers come home, and are astonished to see all the household work done and the dinner ready. They begin to look if there is anyone in the house, but they never think of looking in the dust-hole, and they go off again to their work. Before night this young girl does all the rest of the work, and had the supper ready against the return of her brothers, and hides herself again in the dust-hole. Her brothers are astonished, and again search the house, but find nothing. They go to bed, and this young girl takes to sewing and sews a whole shirt. She gives it to her eldest brother, and in the same way she made a shirt every night, and took it to one of her brothers. They could not understand how that all happened. They always said that they would not go to sleep, but they fell asleep as soon as they were in bed. When the turn of the youngest came to have the shirt, he said to them, ""Certainly I will not fall asleep."" After he is in bed the young girl goes and says to him, thinking that he is asleep, ""Your turn has come now at last, my dearly loved brother."" And she begins to put the shirt on him on the bed, when her brother says to her, ""You are then my sister, you?"" And he kisses her. She tells him then how she had heard that she had brothers, and how she had wished to go to them to help them. The other brothers get up and rejoice, learning that it was their sister who had done all the household work. The brothers forbad her ever to go to such a neighbor's, whatever might happen. But one day, without thinking about it, when she was behindhand with her work, she went running to the house to ask for some fire, in order to make the supper ready quicker. She was very well received; the woman offered to give her everything she wanted, but she said she was satisfied with a little fire. This woman was a witch, and gives her a parcel of herbs, telling her to put them as they were into the footbath -- that they relieved the fatigue very much. Every evening the seven brothers washed their feet at the same time in a large copper. She therefore put these herbs into the copper, and as soon as they had dipped their feet in they became six cows, and the seventh a Breton cow. This poor girl was in such trouble as cannot be told. The poor cows all used to kiss their sister, but the young girl always loved much best the Breton one. Every day she took them to the field, and stopped with them to guard them. One day when she was there the son of a king passes by, and is quite astonished to see so beautiful a girl there. He speaks to her, and tells her that he wishes to marry her. The young girl says to him that she is very poor, and that that cannot be. The king says, ""Yes, yes, yes, that makes no difference."" The young girl makes as conditions that, if she marries him, he must never kill these cows, and especially this little Breton one. The king promises it her, and they are married. The princess takes these cows home with her; they were always well treated. The princess became pregnant, and was confined while the king was absent. The witch comes, and takes her out of her bed, and throws her down a precipice that there was in the king's grounds, and the witch puts herself into the princess' bed. When the king comes home, he finds her very much changed, and tells her that he would not have recognized her. The princess tells him that it was her sufferings that had made her thus, and, in order to cure her more quickly, he must have the Breton cow killed. The king says to her, ""What! Did you not make me promise that she should never be killed? How is it you ask me that?"" The witch considered that one her greatest enemy; and, as she left him no peace, he sent a servant to fetch the cows. He finds them all seven by the precipice; they were lowing, and he tried to drive them to the house, but he could not do it in any way; and he hears a voice, which says, ""It is not for myself that I grieve so much, but for my child, and for my husband, and for my dearly loved cows. Who will take care of them?"" The lad could not succeed (in driving them), and goes and tells to the king what is taking place. The king himself goes to the precipice, and hears this voice. He quickly throws a long cord down, and, when he thinks that she has had time to take hold of it, he pulls it up, and sees that they have got the princess there. Judge of the joy of the king! She relates to her husband all that the witch had done to her, both formerly and now. The king goes to the witch's bed, and says to her, ""I know your villainies now; and, if you do not immediately change these cows, as they were before, into fine boys, I will put you into a red-hot oven."" The witch makes them fine men, and, notwithstanding that, the king had her burnt in a red-hot oven, and threw her ashes into the air. The king lived happily with his wife, and her seven brothers married ladies of the court, and sent for their mother, and they all lived happily together. Return to D. L.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Six Swans,"""My dear woman,"" he said to her, ""can you show me the way through the woods?"" ""Oh, yes, your majesty,"" she answered, ""I can indeed. However, there is one condition, and if you do not fulfill it, you will never get out of these woods, and will die here of hunger."" ""What sort of condition is it?"" asked the king. ""I have a daughter,"" said the old woman, ""who is as beautiful as anyone you could find in all the world, and who well deserves to become your wife. If you will make her your queen, I will show you the way out of the woods."" The king was so frightened that he consented, and the old woman led him to her cottage, where her daughter was sitting by the fire. She received the king as if she had been expecting him. He saw that she was very beautiful, but in spite of this he did not like her, and he could not look at her without secretly shuddering. After he had lifted the girl onto his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the king arrived again at his royal castle, where the wedding was celebrated. The king had been married before, and by his first wife he had seven children, six boys and one girl. He loved them more than anything else in the world. Fearing that the stepmother might not treat them well, even do them harm, he took them to a secluded castle which stood in the middle of a forest. It was so well hidden, and the way was so difficult to find, that he himself would not have found it, if a wise woman had not given him a ball of magic yarn. Whenever he threw it down in front of him, it would unwind itself and show him the way. However, the king went out to his dear children so often that the queen took notice of his absence. She was curious and wanted to know what he was doing out there all alone in the woods. She gave a large sum of money to his servants, and they revealed the secret to her. They also told her about the ball of yarn which could point out the way all by itself. She did not rest until she discovered where the king kept the ball of yarn. Then she made some little shirts of white silk. Having learned the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a magic charm into each one of them. Then one day when the king had ridden out hunting, she took the little shirts and went into the woods. The ball of yarn showed her the way. The children, seeing that someone was approaching from afar, thought that their dear father was coming to them. Full of joy, they ran to meet him. Then she threw one of the shirts over each of them, and when the shirts touched their bodies they were transformed into swans, and they flew away over the woods. The queen went home very pleased, believing that she had gotten rid of her stepchildren. However, the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the queen knew nothing about her. The next day the king went to visit his children, but he found no one there but the girl. ""Where are your brothers?"" asked the king. ""Oh, dear father,"" she answered, ""they have gone away and left me alone."" Then she told him that from her window she had seen how her brothers had flown away over the woods as swans. She showed him the feathers that they had dropped into the courtyard, and which she had gathered up. The king mourned, but he did not think that the queen had done this wicked deed. Fearing that the girl would be stolen away from him as well, he wanted to take her away with him, but she was afraid of her stepmother and begged the king to let her stay just this one more night in the castle in the woods. The poor girl thought, ""I can no longer stay here. I will go and look for my brothers."" And when night came she ran away and went straight into the woods. She walked the whole night long without stopping, and the next day as well, until she was too tired to walk any further. Then she saw a hunter's hut and went inside. She found a room with six little beds, but she did not dare to get into one of them. Instead she crawled under one of them and lay down on the hard ground where she intended to spend the night. The sun was about to go down when she heard a rushing sound and saw six swans fly in through the window. Landing on the floor, they blew on one another, and blew all their feathers off. Then their swan-skins came off just like shirts. The girl looked at them and recognized her brothers. She was happy and crawled out from beneath the bed. The brothers were no less happy to see their little sister, but their happiness did not last long. ""You cannot stay here,"" they said to her. ""This is a robbers' den. If they come home and find you, they will murder you."" ""Can't you protect me?"" asked the little sister. ""No,"" they answered. ""We can take off our swan-skins for only a quarter hour each evening. Only during that time do we have our human forms. After that we are again transformed into swans."" Crying, the little sister said, ""Can you not be redeemed?"" ""Alas, no,"" they answered. ""The conditions are too difficult. You would not be allowed to speak or to laugh for six years, and in that time you would have to sew together six little shirts from asters for us. And if a single word were to come from your mouth, all your work would be lost."" After the brothers had said this, the quarter hour was over, and they flew out the window again as swans. Nevertheless, the girl firmly resolved to redeem her brothers, even if it should cost her her life. She left the hunter's hut, went to the middle of the woods, seated herself in a tree, and there spent the night. The next morning she went out and gathered asters and began to sew. She could not speak with anyone, and she had no desire to laugh. She sat there, looking only at her work. After she had already spent a long time there it happened that the king of the land was hunting in these woods. His huntsmen came to the tree where the girl was sitting. They called to her, saying, ""Who are you?"" But she did not answer. ""Come down to us,"" they said. ""We will not harm you."" She only shook her head. When they pressed her further with questions, she threw her golden necklace down to them, thinking that this would satisfy them. But they did not stop, so she then threw her belt down to them, and when this did not help, her garters, and then -- one thing at a time -- everything that she had on and could do without, until finally she had nothing left but her shift. The huntsmen, however, not letting themselves be dissuaded, climbed the tree, lifted the girl down, and took her to the king. The king asked, ""Who are you? What are you doing in that tree?"" But she did not answer. He asked her in every language that he knew, but she remained as speechless as a fish. Because she was so beautiful, the king's heart was touched, and he fell deeply in love with her. He put his cloak around her, lifted her onto his horse in front of himself, and took her to his castle. There he had her dressed in rich garments, and she glistened in her beauty like bright daylight, but no one could get a word from her. At the table he seated her by his side, and her modest manners and courtesy pleased him so much that he said, ""My desire is to marry her, and no one else in the world."" A few days later they were married. Now the king had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young queen. ""Who knows,"" she said, ""where the girl who cannot speak comes from? She is not worthy of a king."" A year later, after the queen had brought her first child into the world, the old woman took it away from her while she was asleep, and smeared her mouth with blood. Then she went to the king and accused her of being a cannibal. The king could not believe this, and would not allow anyone to harm her. She, however, sat the whole time sewing on the shirts, and caring for nothing else. The next time, when she again gave birth to a beautiful boy, the deceitful mother-in-law did the same thing again, but the king could not bring himself to believe her accusations. He said, ""She is too pious and good to do anything like that. If she were not speechless, and if she could defend herself, her innocence would come to light."" But when the old woman stole away a newly born child for the third time, and accused the queen, who did not defend herself with a single word, the king had no choice but to bring her to justice, and she was sentenced to die by fire. When the day came for the sentence to be carried out, it was also the last day of the six years during which she had not been permitted to speak or to laugh, and she had thus delivered her dear brothers from the magic curse. The six shirts were finished. Only the left sleeve of the last one was missing. When she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm. Standing there, as the fire was about to be lighted, she looked around, and six swans came flying through the air. Seeing that their redemption was near, her heart leapt with joy. The swans rushed towards her, swooping down so that she could throw the shirts over them. As soon as the shirts touched them their swan-skins fell off, and her brothers stood before her in their own bodies, vigorous and handsome. However, the youngest was missing his left arm. In its place he had a swan's wing. They embraced and kissed one another. Then the queen went to the king, who was greatly moved, and she began to speak, saying, ""Dearest husband, now I may speak and reveal to you that I am innocent, and falsely accused."" Then she told him of the treachery of the old woman who had taken away their three children and hidden them. Then to the king's great joy they were brought forth. As a punishment, the wicked mother-in-law was tied to the stake and burned to ashes. But the king and the queen with her six brothers lived many long years in happiness and peace.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Die sechs Schwäne,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm [Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales], 7th ed., vol. 1 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterischen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 49, pp. 245-50.",The Grimms' source: Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild (1795-1867).

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Twelve Brothers,"This saddened the queen, for she loved her sons greatly and did not know how to save them. Finally she went to the youngest one, whom she loved even more than the others, and revealed to him what the king had decided, saying, ""Dear child, go out into the forest with your eleven brothers. Stay there and do not return home. One of you must keep watch from a tree and look toward the tower here. If I bring a little son into the world, then I shall fly a white flag from the top of the tower, but if it is a little daughter, then it shall be a red flag. Then you must save yourselves by fleeing into the world, and may God protect you. I will get up every night and pray for you, in the cold of winter that you may not freeze and that a warm fire may be burning before you, and in the heat of summer that you may rest and sleep in a cool forest."" Thus she blessed her children, and they went forth into the forest. They often looked toward the tower, and one of them always had to sit high in a tall oak tree and keep watch. Soon a flag was raised, but it was not the white one, but rather the red-blood flag that threatened their destruction. When the boys saw it they became angry and cried out, ""Are we to lose our lives for the sake of a girl!"" Then they swore among themselves to remain in the middle of the forest, and whenever they might happen upon a girl, they would kill her without mercy. They found a cave in the darkest part of the forest, and there they lived. Every morning eleven of them set forth to hunt, but one of them had to stay at home to cook and keep house. Every girl that the eleven came upon was done away with without mercy. And so it was for many years. The little sister at home grew up as an only child. One day she discovered twelve men's shirts in the wash. ""Whose shirts are these?"" asked the princess. ""They are much too small for my father."" Then the washerwoman told her that she had had twelve brothers who had secretly left home because the king had wanted to have them killed, and no one knew where they now were. The twelve shirts belonged to these twelve brothers. The little sister was amazed that she had never heard anything of her twelve brothers. That afternoon she sat in a meadow bleaching the wash and pondering the words of the washerwoman. Finally she stood up, took the twelve shirts, and walked into the forest where her brothers lived. The little sister came to the cave where they lived. Eleven were out hunting, and only one of them was at home doing the cooking. When he saw the girl he grabbed her and reached for his sword, saying, ""Kneel down! Your red blood will flow this instant!"" ""Master, let me live!"" she begged. ""I will stay here and serve you well. I will cook and keep house."" Now this was the youngest brother, and the girl's beauty softened him, and he spared her life. The eleven returned home and were amazed to find a live girl in their cave. He said to them, ""Brothers, this girl came to our cave. I was about to strike her down, but she begged so fervently for her life, and agreed to serve us faithfully and to keep house for us, so I spared her."" The others agreed that this was to their advantage, and that now all twelve would be able to go out hunting, and they were satisfied. Then she showed them the twelve shirts and said that she was their sister. They rejoiced and were happy that they had not killed her. The little sister took over the household. While the brothers were out hunting, she gathered wood and herbs, tended the fire, made the clean, white beds, and did everything eagerly and well. One day it happened that when she was finished with her work she went for a walk in the woods. She came to a place where there were twelve tall white lilies, and because she liked them so much, she plucked them all. This had scarcely happened when an old woman appeared before her. ""Oh, my daughter,"" she said. ""Why didn't you leave the twelve flowers standing? They are your twelve brothers, who have now been transformed into ravens and are lost forever."" The little sister began to cry. ""Oh!"" she said. ""Is there no way to redeem them?"" ""No, there is only one way in the world, and it is so difficult that you will never succeed. You must remain silent for twelve whole years. If you speak a single word, even if all but one hour has passed, then it will all be for nothing, and your brothers will die that instant."" The little sister took a seat high in a tall tree in the forest where she would spin in silence for twelve years and thus redeem her brothers. One day a king was hunting in this forest. His dog stopped at the tree and barked. The king halted, looked up, and was amazed at the princess's beauty. He called to her, asking her if she would become his wife. She remained silent, but nodded a little with her head. The king himself climbed up and lifted her down, set her before him on his horse, and took her home to his castle, where their wedding was celebrated with splendor. The princess never spoke a word, and the king thought that she was a mute. They would have lived happily together if it had not been for the king's mother, who began to slander her to him, ""You have brought home a common beggar girl, and behind your back she is doing the most unspeakable things."" Because the queen could not defend herself, the king was led into believing his mother, and finally he had his wife sentenced to death. A large fire was set in the courtyard where she was to be burned to death. She was already standing in the fire, with the flames jumping at her dress when the last minutes of the twelve years elapsed. There was a rushing sound in the air, and twelve ravens came flying down and landed. When they touched the earth they turned into twelve handsome princes, who scattered the fire about, and pulled out their sister. Then she spoke once again, telling the king everything, how she had had to redeem her twelve brothers, and they all rejoiced that everything turned out so well. But what should they do with the wicked stepmother? She was thrown into a barrel filled with boiling oil and poisonous snakes, and died a miserable death.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Die zwölf Brüder,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm [Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales], 7th ed., vol. 1 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterischen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 9, pp. 48-53.","The young queen's ""unspeakable"" acts are specified in less inhibited versions of this episode.

The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Twelve Wild Ducks,"But the words were scarce out of her mouth before an old witch of the trolls came up to her. ""A daughter you shall have,"" she said, ""and she shall be as white as snow and as red as blood; and your sons shall be mine, but you may keep them till the babe is christened."" So when the time came the queen had a daughter, and she was as white as snow, and as red as blood, just as the troll had promised, and so they called her ""Snow-White and Rosy-Red."" Well, there was great joy at the king's court, and the queen was as glad as glad could be; but when what she had promised to the old witch came into her mind, she sent for a silversmith, and bade him make twelve silver spoons, one for each prince, and after that she bade him make one more, and that she gave to Snow-White and Rosy-Red. But as soon as ever the princess was christened, the princes were turned into twelve wild ducks, and flew away. They never saw them again. Away they went, and away they stayed. So the princess grew up, and she was both tall and fair, but she was often so strange and sorrowful, and no one could understand what it was that ailed her. But one evening, the queen was also sorrowful, for she had many strange thoughts when she thought of her sons. She said to Snow-White and Rosy-Red, ""Why are you so sorrowful, my daughter? Is there anything you want? If so, only say the word, and you shall have it."" ""Oh, it seems so dull and lonely here,"" said Snow-White and Rosy-Red."" Everyone else has brothers and sisters, but I am all alone; I have none; and that's why I'm so sorrowful."" ""But you had brothers, my daughter,"" said the queen. ""I had twelve sons who were your brothers, but I gave them all away to get you."" And so she told her the whole story. So when the princes heard that, she had no rest; for, in spite of all the queen could say or do, and all she wept and prayed, the lassie would set off to seek her brothers, for she thought it was all her fault; and at last she got leave to go away from the palace. On and on she walked into the wide world, so far, yon would never have thought a young lady could have strength to walk so far. So, once, when she was walking through a great, great wood, one day she felt tired, and sat down on a mossy tuft and fell asleep. Then she dreamt that she went deeper and deeper into the wood, till she came to a little wooden hut, and there she found her brothers; just then she woke, and straight before her she saw a worn path in the green moss, and this path went deeper into the wood; so she followed it, and after a long time she came to just such a little wooden house as that she had seen in her dream. Now, when she went into the room there was no one at home, but there stood twelve beds, and twelve chairs, and twelve spoons -- a dozen of everything, in short. So when she saw that she was so glad, she hadn't been so glad for many a long year, for she could guess at once that her brothers lived here, and that they owned the beds, and chairs, and spoons. So she began to make up the fire, and sweep the room, and make the beds, and cook the dinner, and to make the house as tidy as she could; and when she had done all the cooking and work, she ate her own dinner, and crept under her youngest brother's bed, and lay down there, but she forgot her spoon upon the table. So she had scarcely laid herself down before she heard something flapping and whirring in the air, and so all the twelve wild ducks came sweeping in; but as soon as they crossed over the threshold they became princes. ""Oh, how nice and warm it is in here,"" they said. ""Heaven bless him who made up the fire, and cooked such a good dinner for us."" And so each took up his silver spoon and was going to eat. But when each had taken his own there was one still left lying on the table, and it was so like the rest that they couldn't tell it from them. ""This is our sister's spoon,"" they said; ""and if her spoon be here, she can't be very far off herself."" ""If this be our sister's spoon, and she be here,"" said the eldest, ""she shall be killed, for she is to blame for all the ill we suffer."" And this she lay under the bed and listened to. ""No"" said the youngest; ""'twere a shame to kill her for that. She has nothing to do with our suffering ill; for if any one's to blame, it's our own mother."" So they set to work hunting for her both high and low, and at last they looked under all the beds, and so when they came to the youngest prince's bed, they found her, and dragged her out. Then the eldest prince wished again to have her killed, but she begged and prayed so prettily for herself. ""Oh! gracious goodness! don't kill me, for I've gone about seeking you these three years, and if I could only set you free, I'd willingly lose my life."" ""Well! ""said they, ""if you will set us free, you may keep your life; for you can if you choose."" ""Yes; only tell me,"" said the princess, ""how it can be done, and I'll do it, whatever it be."" ""You must pick thistledown,"" said the princes, ""and you must card it, and spin it, and weave it; and after you have done that, you must cut out and make twelve coats, and twelve shirts, and twelve neckerchiefs, one for each of us, and while you do that, you must neither talk, nor laugh, nor weep. If you can do that, we are free."" ""But where shall I ever get thistle-down enough for so many neckerchiefs, and shirts, and coats? "" asked Snow-White and Rosy-Red. ""We'll soon show you,"" said the princes. And so they took her with them to a great wide moor, where there stood such a crop of thistles, all nodding and nodding in the breeze, and the down all floating and glistening like gossamers through the air in the sunbeams. The princess had never seen such a quantity of thistledown in her life, and she began to pluck and gather it as fast and as well as she could; and when she got home at night she set to work carding and spinning yarn from the down. So she went on a long long time, picking, and carding, and spinning, and all the while keeping the princes' house, cooking, and making their beds. At evening home they came, flapping and whirring like wild ducks, and all night they were princes, but in the morning off they flew again, and were wild ducks the whole day. But now it happened once, when she was out on the moor to pick thistledown -- and if I don't mistake, it was the very last time she was to go thither -- it happened that the young king who ruled that land was out hunting, and came riding across the moor and saw her. So he stopped there and wondered who the lovely lady could be that walked along the moor picking thistledown, and he asked her her name, and when he could get no answer, he was still more astonished. And at last he liked her so much, that nothing would do but he must take her home to his castle and marry her. So he ordered his servants to take her and put her up on his horse. Snow-White and Rosy-Red, she wrung her hands, and made signs to them, and pointed to the bags in which her work was, and when the king saw she wished to have them with her, he told his men to take up the bags behind them. When they had done that the princess came to herself, little by little, for the king was both a wise man and a handsome man too, and he was as soft and kind to her as a doctor. But when they got home to the palace, and the old queen, who was his stepmother, set eyes on Snow-White and Rosy-Red, she got so cross and jealous of her because she was so lovely, that she said to the king, ""Can't you see now, that this thing whom you have picked up, and whom you are going to many, is a witch. Why, she can't either talk, or laugh, or weep!"" But the king didn't care a pin for what she said, but held on with the wedding, and married Snow-White and Rosy-Red, and they lived in great joy and glory; but she didn't forget to go on sewing at her shirts. So when the year was almost out, Snow-White and Rosy-Red brought a prince into the world, and then the old queen was more spiteful and jealous than ever, and at dead of night, she stole in to Snow-White and Rosy-Red, while she slept, and took away her babe, and threw it into a pit full of snakes. After that she cut Snow-White and Rosy-Red in her finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth, and went straight to the king. ""Now come and see,"" she said, ""what sort of a thing you have taken for your queen; here she has eaten up her own babe."" Then the king was so downcast, he almost burst into tears, and said, ""Yes, it must be true, sure I see it with my own eyes; but she'll not do it again, I'm sure, and so this time I'll spare her life."" So before the next year was out she had another son, and the same thing happened. The king's stepmother got more and more jealous and spiteful. She stole in to the young queen at night while she slept, took away the babe, and threw it into a pit full of snakes, cut the young queen's finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth, and then went and told the king she had eaten up her own child. Then the king was so sorrowful, you can't think how sorry he was, and he said, ""Yes, it must be true, since I see it with my own eyes; but she'll not do it again, I'm sure, and so this time too I'll spare her life."" Well! before the next year was out, Snow-White and Rosy-Red brought a daughter into the world, and her, too, the old queen took and threw into the pit full of snakes, while the young queen slept. Then she cut her finger, smeared the blood over her mouth, and went again to the king and said, "" Now you may come and see if it isn't as I say; she's a wicked, wicked witch for here she has gone and eaten up her third babe too."" Then the king was so sad, there was no end to it, for now he couldn't spare her any longer, but had to order her to be burnt alive on a pile of wood. But just when the pile was all ablaze, and they were going to put her on it, she made signs to them to take twelve boards and lay them round the pile, and on these she laid the neckerchiefs, and the shirts, and the coats for her brothers, but the youngest brother's shirt wanted its left arm, for she hadn't had time to finish it. And as soon as ever she had done that, they heard such a flapping and whirring in the air, and down came twelve wild ducks flying over the forest, and each of them snapped up his clothes in his bill and flew off with them. ""See now! "" said the old queen to the king, ""Wasn't I right when I told you she was a witch; but make haste and burn her before the pile burns low."" ""Oh!"" said the king, ""We've wood enough and to spare, and so I'll wait a bit, for I have a mind to see what the end of all this will be."" As he spoke up came the twelve princes riding along, as handsome well-grown lads as you'd wish to see; but the youngest prince had a wild duck's wing instead of his left arm. ""What's all this about?"" asked the princes. ""My queen is to be burnt,"" said the king, ""because she's a witch, and because she has eaten up her own babes."" ""She hasn't eaten them at all,"" said the princes. ""Speak now, sister. You have set us free and saved us, now save yourself."" Then Snow-White and Rosy-Red spoke, and told the whole story; how every time she was brought to bed, the old queen, the king's stepmother, had stolen into her at night, and taken her babes away, and cut her little finger, and smeared the blood over her mouth. And then the princes took the king, and showed him the snake pit where three babes lay playing with adders and toads, and lovelier children you never saw. So the king had them taken out at once, and went to his stepmother, and asked her what punishment she thought that woman deserved who could find it in her heart to betray a guiltless queen and three such blessed little babes. ""She deserves to be fast bound between twelve unbroken steeds, so that each may take his share of her,"" said the old queen. ""You have spoken your own doom,"" said the king, ""and you shall suffer it at once."" So the wicked old queen was fast bound between twelve unbroken steeds, and each got his share of her. But the king took Snow-White and Rosy-Red, and their three children, and the twelve princes; and so they all went home to their father and mother, and told all that had befallen them, and there was joy and gladness over the whole kingdom, because the princess was saved and set free, and because she had set free her twelve brothers.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Engebretsen Moe, Popular Tales from the Norse, translated by George Webbe Dasent (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1859), pp. 423-32.",Link to the original Norwegian text: De tolv villender.,NA
The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds,0451,The Twelve Wild Geese,"""Oh,"" says she, ""if I had only a daughter with her skin as white as that snow, her cheeks as red as that blood, and her hair as black as that raven, I'd give away every one of my twelve sons for her."" The moment she said the word, she got a great fright, and a shiver went through her, and in an instant after, a severe-looking old woman stood before her. ""That was a wicked wish you made,"" said she, ""and to punish you it will be granted. You will have such a daughter as you desire, but the very day of her birth you will lose your other children."" She vanished the moment she said the words. And that very way it turned out. When she expected her delivery, she had her children all in a large room of the palace, with guards all round it, but the very hour her daughter came into the world, the guards inside and outside heard a great whirling and whistling, and the twelve princes were seen flying one after another out through the open window, and away like so many arrows over the woods. Well, the king was in great grief for the loss of his sons, and be would be very enraged with his wife if he only knew that she was so much to blame for it. Everyone called the little princess Snow-White-and-Rose-Red on account of her beautiful complexion. She was the most loving and loveable child that could be seen anywhere. When she was twelve years old she began to be very sad and lonely, and to torment her mother, asking her about her brothers that she thought were dead, for none up to that time ever told her the exact thing that happened them. The secret was weighing very heavy on the queen's conscience, and as the little girl persevered in her questions, at last she told her. ""Well, mother,"" said she, ""it was on my account my poor brothers were changed into wild geese, and are now suffering all sorts of hardship; before the world is a day older, I'll be off to seek them, and try to restore them to their own shapes."" The king and queen had her well watched, but all was no use. Next night she was getting through the woods that surrounded the palace, and she went on and on that night, and till the evening of next day. She had a few cakes with her, and she got nuts, and mugoreens (fruit of the sweet briar) and some sweet crabs as she went along. At last she came to a nice wooden house just at sunset. There was a fine garden round it, full of the handsomest flowers, and a gate in the hedge. She went in, and saw a table laid out with twelve plates, and twelve knives and forks, and twelve spoons, and there were cakes, and cold wild fowl, and fruit along with the plates, and there was a good fire, and in another long room there were twelve beds. Well, while she was looking about her she heard the gate opening, and footsteps along the walk, and in came twelve young men, and there was great grief and surprise on all their faces when they laid eyes on her. ""Oh, what misfortune sent you here?"" said the eldest. ""For the sake of a girl we were obliged to leave our father's court, and be in the shape of wild geese all day. That's twelve years ago, and we took a solemn oath that we would kill the first young girl that came into our hands. It's a pity to put such an innocent and handsome girl as you are out of the world, but we must keep our oath."" ""But,"" said she, ""I'm your only sister that never knew anything about this till yesterday; and I stole away from our father's and mother's palace last night to find you out and relieve you if I can."" Every one of them clasped his hands, and looked down on the floor, and you could hear a pin fall till the eldest cried out, ""A curse light on our oath! what shall we do?"" ""I'll tell you that,"" said an old woman that appeared at the instant among them. ""Break your wicked oath which no one should keep. If you attempted to lay an uncivil finger on her I'd change you into twelve booliaun buis (stalks of ragweed), but I wish well to you as well as to her. She is appointed to be your deliverer in this way. She must spin and knit twelve shirts for you out of bog down, to be gathered by her own hands on the moor just outside of the wood. It will take her five years to do it, and if she once speaks, or laughs, or cries the whole time, you will have to remain wild geese by day till you're called out of the world. So take care of your sister; it is worth your while."" The fairy then vanished, and it was only a strife with the brothers to see who would be first to kiss and hug their sister. So for three long years the poor young princess was occupied pulling bog down, spinning it, and knitting it into shirts, and at the end of the three years she had eight made. During all that time, she never spoke a word, nor laughed, nor cried; the last was the hardest to refrain from. One fine day she was sitting in the garden spinning, when in sprung a fine greyhound and bounded up to her, and laid his paws on her shoulder, and licked her forehead and her hair. The next minute a beautiful young prince rode up to the little garden gate, took off his hat, and asked for leave to come in. She gave him a little nod, and in he walked. He made ever so many apologies for intruding, and asked her ever so many questions, but not a word could he get out of her. He loved her so much from the first moment, that he could not leave her till he told her he was king of a country just bordering on the forest, and he begged her to come home with him, and be his wife. She couldn't help loving him as much as he did her, and though she shook her head very often and was very sorry to leave her brothers, at last she nodded her head, and put her hand in his, she knew well enough that the good fairy and her brothers would he able to find her out. Before she went she brought out a basket holding all her bog down, and another holding the eight shirts. The attendants took charge of these, and the prince placed her before him on his horse. The only thing that disturbed him while riding along was the displeasure his stepmother would feel at what he had done. However he was full master at home, and as soon as he arrived he sent for the bishop, got his bride nicely dressed, and the marriage was celebrated, the bride answering by signs. He knew by her manners she was of high birth, and no two could be fonder of each other. The wicked stepmother did all she could to make mischief, saying she was sure she was only a woodman's daughter; but nothing could disturb the young king's opinion of his wife. In good time the young queen was delivered of a beautiful boy, and the king was so glad he hardly knew what to do for joy. All the grandeur of the christening and the happiness of the parents tormented the bad woman more than I can tell you, and she determined to put a stop to all their comfort. She got a sleeping posset given to the young mother, and while she was thinking and thinking how she could best make away with the child, she saw a wicked-looking wolf in the garden, looking up at her, and licking his chops. She lost no time, but snatched the child from the arms of the sleeping woman, and pitched it out. The beast caught it in his mouth, and was over the garden fence in a minute. The wicked woman then pricked her own fingers, and dabbled the blood round the mouth of the sleeping mother. Well, the young king was just then coming into the big bawn from hunting, and as soon as he entered the house, she beckoned to him, shed a few crocodile tears, began to cry and wring her hands, and hurried him along the passage to the bedchamber. Oh, wasn't the poor king frightened when he saw the queen's mouth bloody, and missed his child? It would take two hours to tell you the devilment of the old queen, the confusion, and fright, and grief of young king and queen, the bad opinion he began to feel of his wife, and the struggle she had to keep down her bitter sorrow, and not give way to it by speaking or lamenting. The young king would not allow anyone to be called, and ordered his step-mother to give out that the child fell from the mother's arms at the window, and that a wild beast ran off with it. The wicked woman pretended to do so, but she told underhand to everybody she spoke to, what the king and herself saw in the bedchamber. The young queen was the most unhappy woman in the three kingdoms for a long time, between sorrow for her child, and her husband's bad opinion; still she neither spoke nor cried, and she gathered bog down and went on with the shirts. Often the twelve wild geese would be seen lighting on the trees in the park or on the smooth sod, and looking in at her windows. So she worked on to get the shirts finished, but another year was at an end, and she had the twelfth shirt finished except one arm, when she was obliged to take to her bed, and a beautiful girl was born. Now the king was on his guard, and he would not let the mother and child be left alone for a minute; but the wicked woman bribed some of the attendants, set others asleep, gave the sleepy posset to the queen, and had a person watching to snatch the child away, and kill it. But what should she see but the same wolf in the garden looking up, and licking his chops again? Out went the child, and away with it flew the wolf, and she smeared the sleeping mother's mouth and face with blood, and then roared, and bawled, and cried out to the king and to everybody she met, and the room was filled, and every one was sure the young queen had just devoured her own babe. The poor mother thought now her life would leave her. She was in such a state she could neither think nor pray, but she sat like a stone, and worked away at the arm of the twelfth shirt. The king was for taking her to the house in the wood where he found her, but the stepmother, and the lords of the court, and the judges would not hear of it, and she was condemned to be burned in the big bawn at three o'clock the same day. When the hour drew near, the king went to the farthest part of his palace, and there was no more unhappy man in his kingdom at that hour. When the executioners came and led her off, she took the pile of shirts in her arms. There were still a few stitches wanted, and while they were tying her to the stake, she still worked on. At the last stitch she seemed overcome and dropped a tear on her work, but the moment after she sprang up, and shouted out, ""I am innocent; call my husband!"" The executioners stayed their hands, except one wicked-disposed creature who set fire to the faggot next him, and while all were struck in amaze, there was a rushing of wings, and in a moment the twelve wild geese were standing round the pile. Before you could count twelve, she flung a shirt over every bird, and there in the twinkling of an eye were twelve of the finest young men that could be collected out of a thousand. While some were untying their sister, the eldest, taking a strong stake in his hand, struck the busy executioner such a blow that he never needed another. While they were comforting the young queen, and the king was hurrying to the spot, a fine-looking woman appeared among them holding the babe on one arm and the little prince by the hand. There was nothing hut crying for joy, and laughing for joy, and hugging and kissing, and when any one had time to thank the good fairy, who in the shape of a wolf, carried the child away, she was not to be found. Never was such happiness enjoyed in any palace that ever was built, and if the wicked queen and her helpers were not torn by wild horses they richly deserved it.",Ireland,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, The Fireside Stories of Ireland (Dublin: M'Glashan and Gill, 1870), pp. 14-19.",NA,NA
Cattarinetta,0333a,Cattarinetta,"Once upon a time there was a mother who had a little daughter named Cattarinetta. One day she wanted to bake a cake and so she sent the girl to borrow a pan from her aunt, who was a wicked witch. The aunt gave the pan to the girl, saying, ""Don't forget to bring me a piece of cake."" The cake was baked, and as soon as it was done the mother cut off a piece and put it in the pan, which the girl was to take back to the aunt. The delicious piece of cake tempted the girl, and as she walked along she pinched off one bite after the other and ate it, until finally there was nothing left in the pan. She was terrified, but she thought of a trick that would help her. She picked up a cow pie from the path and laid it in the pan so that it looked like a piece of cake with brown crust. ""Did you bring me the pan and a piece of cake?"" asked the aunt as Cattarinetta arrived. ""Yes,"" said the girl, then set the pan down and ran away hurriedly. Cattarinetta arrived back home, and when night fell she went to bed. Then suddenly she heard her aunt's voice calling, ""Cattarinetta, I am coming. I am already at your front door!"" The girl slid further down into her bed, but the voice called out in short intervals again and again: ""Cattarinetta, I am coming. I am already on the stairway!"" ""Cattarinetta, I am coming.

""I plucked the barley and I malted the corn and brewed the beer, and the beer is good,"" cackled the hen. ""Is the wort strong enough?"" said the cock, and flew up to the edge of the vat to taste it; but when he stooped down to take a sip he began flapping with his wings and fell on his head into the vat and was drowned. When the hen saw this she was quite beside herself. She flew onto the hearth and began to scream and cry, ""Got, got, got, drowned! Got, got, got, drowned!"" And this she went on crying all the time and would not stop. ""What is the matter with you, Mother Tup, since you are crying and grieving so?"" asked the hand-quern.

""Oh, Father Tup has fallen into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving and the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; therefore I creak and crack and crackle,"" said the stool. ""Well, if I can't do anything else I'll bang and slam and whine and whistle"" said the door, and began opening and shutting and slamming and banging till it went through one's bones and marrow to hear it. This the dustbin heard. ""Why are you slamming and banging like that, door?"" said the bin. ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; therefore I keep slamming and banging,"" said the door. ""Well, if I can't do anything else I'll fume and smoke,"" said the dustbin, and began fuming and smoking and sending the dust up in clouds all over the room. This the hay-rake saw, as it stood peeping in through the window. ""Why are you raising the dust like that, dustbin?"" asked the rake. ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; therefore I keep fuming and smoking,"" said the dustbin. ""Well, if I can't do anything else I'll rake and rend,"" said the rake, and began rending and raking. This the aspen tree saw as it looked on. ""Why do you rend and rake like that, rake? said the tree. ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; therefore I keep rending and raking,"" said the rake. ""Well, if I can't do anything else,"" said the aspen, ""I will quiver and quake."" This the birds noticed. ""Why do you quiver and quake like that?"" said the birds to the tree. ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; therefore I quiver and quake,"" said the aspen. ""Well, if we can't do anything else we will pluck off our feathers,"" said the birds, and began pecking and plucking till the feathers flew about the farm like snow. The farmer stood looking on, and when he saw the feathers flying about he asked the birds, ""Why are you plucking off your feathers like that, birds?"" ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; the aspen is quivering and quaking; therefore we keep pecking and plucking,"" said the birds. ""Well, if I can't do anything else I will pull the besoms to pieces,"" said the farmer, and began tugging and pulling the besoms to pieces, so that the twigs flew about, both east and west. His wife was boiling the porridge for supper when she saw this. ""Why are you pulling the besoms to pieces, husband?"" said she. ""Oh, Father Tup fell into the brewing vat and got drowned; Mother Tup is sitting on the hearth crying and grieving; the hand-quern is grinding and groaning; the stool is creaking and cracking; the door is slamming and banging; the dustbin is fuming and smoking; the rake is rending and raking; the aspen is quivering and quaking; the birds are pecking and plucking off their feathers; therefore I am pulling the besom to pieces,"" said the man. ""Well, then I'll daub the walls all over with porridge,"" she said. And she set about it there and then, and took one ladleful after another and smeared the porridge all over the walls, so that no one could see what they were made of.

Type 2022: Mourning the Death of a Spouse,2022,The Death and Burial of Poor Hen-Sparrow,"The wedding was a mighty grand affair, and everybody as jolly and merry as could be, except of course the poor old wife, who crept away from all the noise and fun to sit disconsolately on a quiet branch just under a crow's nest, where she could be as melancholy as she liked without anybody poking fun at her. Now while she sat there it began to rain, and after a while the drops, soaking through the crow's nest, came drip-dripping onto her feathers. She, however, was far too miserable to care, and sat there all huddled up and peepy till the shower was over. Now it so happened that the crow had used some scraps of dyed cloth in lining its nest, and as these became wet the colors ran, and dripping down on to the poor old hen-sparrow beneath, dyed her feathers until she was as gay as a peacock. Fine feathers make fine birds, we all know, and she really looked quite spruce; so much so, that when she flew home, the new wife nearly burst with envy, and asked her at once where she had found such a lovely dress. ""Easily enough,"" replied the old wife; ""I just went into the dyer's vat."" The bride instantly determined to go there also. She could not endure the notion of the old thing being better dressed than she was, so she flew off at once to the dyer's, and being in a great hurry, went pop into the middle of the vat, without waiting to see if it was hot or cold. It turned out to be just scalding. Consequently the poor thing was half boiled before she managed to scramble out. Meanwhile, the gay old cock, not finding his bride at home, flew about distractedly in search of her, and you may imagine what bitter tears he wept when he found her, half drowned and half boiled, with her feathers all awry, lying by the dyer's vat. ""What has happened?"" quoth he. But the poor bedraggled thing could only gasp out feebly: Whereupon the cock-sparrow took her up tenderly in his bill and flew away home with his precious burden. Now, just as he was crossing the big river in front of his house, the old hen-sparrow, in her gay dress, looked out of the window, and when she saw her old husband bringing home his young bride in such a sorry plight, she burst out laughing shrilly, and called aloud, ""That is right! That is right! Remember what the song says: Of course, when he opened his mouth to speak, the poor draggled bride fell out, and, going plump into the river, was drowned. Whereupon the cock-sparrow was so distracted with grief that he picked off all his feathers until he was as bare as a plowed field. Then, going to a pipal tree, he sat all naked and forlorn on the branches, sobbing and sighing. ""What has happened?"" cried the pipal tree, aghast at the sight. ""Don't ask me!"" wailed the cock-sparrow. ""It isn't manners to ask questions when a body is in deep mourning."" But the pipal would not be satisfied without an answer, so at last poor bereaved cock-sparrow replied: On hearing this sad tale, the pipal became overwhelmed with grief and, declaring it must mourn also, shed all its leaves on the spot. By and by a buffalo, coming in the heat of the day to rest in the shade of the pipal tree, was astonished to find nothing but bare twigs. ""What has happened?"" cried the buffalo. ""You were as green as possible yesterday!"" ""Don't ask me!"" whimpered the pipal. ""Where are your manners? Don't you know it isn't decent to ask questions when people are in mourning?"" But the buffalo insisted on having an answer, so at last, with many sobs and sighs, the pipal replied: ""Oh dear me!"" cried the buffalo. ""How very sad! I really must mourn too!"" So she immediately cast her horns, and began to weep and wail. After a while, becoming thirsty, she went to drink at the riverside. ""Goodness gracious!"" cried the river, ""What is the matter? And what have you done with your horns?"" ""How rude you are!"" wept the buffalo. ""Can't you see I am in deep mourning? And it isn't polite to ask questions."" But the river persisted until the buffalo, with many groans, replied: ""Dreadful!"" cried the river, and wept so fast that its water became quite salt [salty]. By and by a cuckoo, coming to bathe in the stream, called out, ""Why, river! What has happened? You are as salt as tears!"" ""Don't ask me!"" mourned the stream. ""It is too dreadful for words!"" Nevertheless, when the cuckoo would take no denial, the river replied: ""Oh dear! Oh dear me!"" cried the cuckoo. ""How very, very sad! I must mourn too!"" So it plucked out an eye, and going to a corn [grain] merchant's shop, sat on the doorstep and wept. ""Why, little cuckoo! what's the matter?"" cried Bhagtu the shopkeeper. ""You are generally the pertest of birds, and today you are as dull as ditchwater!"" ""Don't ask me!"" sniveled the cuckoo. ""It is such terrible grief! Such dreadful sorrow! Such-such horrible pain!"" However, when Bhagtu persisted, the cuckoo, wiping its one eye on its wing, replied: ""Bless my heart!"" cried Bhagtu, ""But that is simply the most heartrending tale I ever heard in my life! I must really mourn likewise!"" Whereupon he wept, and wailed, and beat his breast, until he went completely out of his mind. And when the queen's maidservant came to buy of him, he gave her pepper instead of turmeric, onion instead of garlic, and wheat instead of pulse. ""Dear me, friend Bhagtu!"" quoth the maidservant. ""Your wits are wool-gathering! What's the matter?"" ""Don't! please don't!"" cried Bhagtu. ""I wish you wouldn't ask me, for I am trying to forget all about it. It is too dreadful -- too, too terrible!"" At last, however, yielding to the maid's entreaties, he replied, with many sobs and tears: ""How very sad!"" exclaimed the maidservant. ""I don't wonder at your distress. But it is always so in this miserable world! Everything goes wrong!"" Whereupon she fell to railing at everybody and everything in the world, until the queen said to her, ""What is the matter, my child? What distresses you?"" ""Oh!"" replied the maidservant, ""The old story! Everyone is miserable, and I most of all! Such dreadful news! -- ""Too true!"" wept the queen, ""Too true! The world is a vale of tears! There is nothing for it but to try and forget!"" Whereupon she set to work dancing away as hard as she could. By and by in came the prince, who, seeing her twirling about, said, ""Why, mother! what is the matter?"" The queen, without stopping, gasped out: ""If that is your mourning, I'll mourn too!"" cried the prince, and seizing his tambourine, he began to thump on it with a will. Hearing the noise, the king came in, and asked what was the matter. ""This is the matter!"" cried the prince, drumming away with all his might: ""Capital! capital!"" cried the king, ""That's the way to do it!"" So, seizing his zither, he began to thrum away like one possessed. And as they danced, the queen, the king, the prince, and the maidservant sang: So they danced and sang till they were tired, and that was how everyone mourned poor cock-sparrow's pretty bride.",Pakistan,"Source: Flora Annie Steel (1847-1929), Tales of the Punjab: Told by the People (London: The Bodley Head, 1973), no. 18, pp. 100-107.","This collection was first published under the title of Wide-Awake Stories (London: Trubner and Company, 1884).

Type 2022: Mourning the Death of a Spouse,2022,Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse,"Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of corn, so they both leased an ear of corn. Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding, so they both made a pudding. And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil, but when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and scalded her to death. Then Tatty sat down and wept. Then a three-legged stool said, ""Tatty, why do you weep?"" ""Titty's dead,"" said Tatty, ""and so I weep."" ""Then,"" said the stool, ""I'll hop,"" so the stool hopped. Then a broom in the corner of the room said, ""Stool, why do you hop?"" ""Oh!"" said the stool, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop."" ""Then,"" said the broom, ""I'll sweep,"" so the broom began to sweep. ""Then,"" said the door, ""Broom, why do you sweep?""

Then said the window, ""Door, why do you jar?"" ""Oh!"" said the door, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, and so I jar."" ""Then,"" said the window, ""I'll creak,"" so the window creaked. Now there was an old form outside the house, and when the window creaked, the form said, ""Window, why do you creak?"" ""Oh!"" said the window, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and so I creak."" ""Then,"" said the old form, ""I'll run round the house."" Then the old form ran round the house. Now there was a fine large walnut tree growing by the cottage, and the tree said to the form, ""Form, why do you run round the house?"" ""Oh!"" said the form, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, and so I run round the house."" ""Then,"" said the walnut tree, ""I'll shed my leaves,"" so the walnut tree shed all its beautiful green leaves. Now there was a little bird perched on one of the boughs of the tree, and when all the leaves fell, it said, ""Walnut tree, why do you shed your leaves?"" ""Oh!"" said the tree, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round the house, and so I shed my leaves."" ""Then,"" said the little bird, ""I'll molt all my feathers,"" so he molted all his pretty feathers. Now there was a little girl walking below, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers' and sisters' supper, and when she saw the poor little bird molt all its feathers, she said, ""Little bird, why do you molt all your feathers?"" ""Oh!"" said the little bird, ""Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut tree sheds its leaves, and so I molt all my feathers."" ""Then,"" said the little girl, ""I'll spill the milk,"" so she dropped the pitcher and spilled the milk. Now there was an old man just by on the top of a ladder thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl spill the milk, he said, ""Little girl, what do you mean by spilling the milk? Your little brothers and sisters must go without their supper."" Then said the little girl, ""Titty's dead, Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut tree sheds all its leaves, the little bird molts all its feathers, and so I spill the milk."" ""Oh!"" said the old man, ""then I'll tumble off the ladder and break my neck,"" so he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck. And when the old man broke his neck, the great walnut tree fell down with a crash, and upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the window out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset the broom, and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse was buried beneath the ruins.",England,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, English Fairy Tales, 3rd ed.

Type 2025: The Runaway Pancake,2025,Johnny-Cake,"Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy. One morning the old woman made a Johnny-Cake and put it in the oven to bake. ""You watch the Johnny-Cake while your father and I go out to work in the garden."" So the old man and the old woman went out and began to hoe potatoes and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he didn't watch it all the time, and all of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped Johnny-Cake and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. The little boy ran to shut the door, but Johnny-Cake was too quick for him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road long before the little boy could catch him. The little boy ran after him as fast as he could lip it, crying out to his father and mother, who heard the uproar and threw down their hoes and gave chase too. But Johnny-Cake outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest. On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to two well-diggers, who looked up from their work and called out, ""Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?"" He said, ""I have outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"" ""Ye can, can ye?"" We'll see about that!"" said they, and they threw down their picks and ran after him, but couldn't catch up with him, and soon they had to sit down by the roadside to rest. On ran Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to two ditch-diggers who were digging a ditch. ""Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?"" said they. He said, ""I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"" ""Ye can, can ye? We'll see about that!"" said they, and they threw down their spades and ran after him too. But Johnny-Cake soon outstripped them also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the chase and sat down to rest. On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a bear. The bear said, ""Where are ye going, Johnny-Cake?"" He said, ""I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"" ""Ye can, can ye?"" growled the bear. ""We'll see about that!"" and trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-Cake, who never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind that he saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so he stretched himself out by the roadside to rest. On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a wolf. The wolf said, ""Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?"" He said, ""I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers and a bear, an I can outrun you too-o-o!"" ""Ye can, can ye?"" snarled the wolf. ""We'll see about that!"" And he set into a gallop after Johnny-Cake, who went on and on so fast that the wolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest. On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, ""Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?"" He said, ""I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"" The fox said, ""I can't quite hear you, Johnny-Cake. Won't you come a little closer?"" turning his head a little to one side. Johnny-Cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little closer, and called out in a very loud voice, ""I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers and a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"" ""Can't quite hear you. Won't you come a little closer?"" Johnny-Cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out, ""I'VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD WOMAN AND A LITTLE BOY AND TWO WELL-DIGGERS AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS AND A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!"" ""You can, can you?"" yelped the fox, and he snapped up the Johnny-Cake in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye. Once upon a time there was a little maneen and a little womaneen; and the little womaneen made a little cakeen and put it in the oven to bake. And the little maneen stood at one side of the oven, and said the little cakeen was done; and the little womaneen stood at the other side and said it wasn't. And while they were quarrelling about it, the little cakeen jumped out of the oven and ran off; and the little maneen and the little womaneen ran after it. Pretty soon the little cakeen came to a little pusheen [cat?], and the little pusheen said, ""Where are you going so fast, little cakeen, on those little legs of yours?"" And the little cakeen said: ""I'm running away from the little maneen; I'm running away from the little womaneen, and now I'll run away from you!"" So the little pusheen ran after it. Then it came to a little dogeen, and the little dogeen said, ""Where are you going so fast, little cakeen, on those little legs of yours?"" And the little cakeen said: ""I'm running away from the little maneen; I'm running away from the little womaneen; I'm running away from the little pusheen, and now I'11 run away from you!"" So the little dogeen ran after it (and so on, with coween, heneen, owleen, etc.). Then it came to a little foxeen; and the little foxeen said: ""Where are you going so fast, little cakeen, on those little legs of yours?""

But the little foxeen said: "" Oh! don't do that, little cakeen; I will show you where to hide."" So the little cakeen said, "" All right!"" So the little foxeen said: ""Jump upon my tail;"" and the little cakeen jumped on his tail. Then the foxeen said: ""Jump on my back;"" and the little cakeen jumped on his back.

One day, when the little old woman was baking gingerbread, she cut a cake in the shape of a little boy, and put it into the oven. Presently she went to the oven to see if it was baked. As soon as the oven door was opened, the little gingerbread boy jumped out, and began to run away as fast as he could go. The little old woman called her husband, and they both ran after him. But they could not catch him. And soon the gingerbread boy came to a barn full of threshers. He called out to them as he went by, saying: Then the barn full of threshers set out to run after him. But, though they ran fast, they could not catch him. And he ran on till he came to a field full of mowers. He called out to them: I've run away from a little old woman, A little old man, A barn full of threshers, And I can run away from you, I can! Then the mowers began to run after him, but they couldn't catch him. And he ran on till he came to a cow. He called out to her: But, though the cow started at once, she couldn't catch him. And soon he came to a pig. He called out to the pig: But the pig ran, and couldn't catch him. And he ran till he came across a fox, and to him he called out: Then the fox set out to run.

""Ah, do! dear, good, kind mother,"" said the fourth. ""Ah, do! dear, good, kind, nice mother,"" said the fifth. ""Ah, do! dear, good, kind, nice, sweet mother,"" said the sixth. ""Ah, do! dear, good, kind, nice, sweet, darling mother,"" said the seventh. And thus they were all begging for pancakes, the one more prettily than the other, because they were so hungry, and such good little children. ""Yes, children dear, wait a bit until it turns itself,"" she answered -- she ought to have said ""until I turn it"" -- ""and then you shall all have pancakes, beautiful pancakes, made of new milk -- only look how thick and happy it lies there."" When the pancake heard this, it got frightened, and all of a sudden, it turned itself and wanted to get out of the pan, but it fell down in it again on the other side, and when it had been fried a little on that side too, it felt a little stronger in the back, jumped out on the floor, and rolled away, like a wheel, right through the door and down the road. ""Halloo!"" cried the good wife, and away she ran after it, with the frying pan in one hand and the ladle in the other, as fast as she could, and the children behind her, while the husband came limping after, last of all. ""Halloo, won't you stop? Catch it, stop it. Halloo there!"" they all screamed, the one louder than the other, trying to catch it on the run, but the pancake rolled and rolled, and before long, it was so far ahead, that they could not see it, for the pancake was much smarter on its legs than any of them. When it had rolled a time, it met a man. ""Good day, pancake!"" said the man. ""Well met, Manny Panny,"" said the pancake. ""Dear pancake,"" said the man, ""don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you."" ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, I must run away from you too, Manny Panny,"" said the pancake, and rolled on and on, until it met a hen. ""Good day, pancake,"" said the hen. ""Good day, Henny Penny,"" said the pancake. ""My dear pancake, don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you,"" said the hen. ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, and from Manny Panny, I must run away from you too, Henny Penny,"" said the pancake, and rolled on like a wheel down the road. Then it met a cock. ""Good day, pancake,"" said the cock. ""Good day, Cocky Locky,"" said the pancake. ""My dear pancake, don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you,"" said the cock. ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, from Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, I must run away from you too, Cocky Locky,"" said the pancake, and rolled and rolled on as fast as it could. When it had rolled a long time, it met a duck. ""Good day, pancake,"" said the duck. ""Good day, Ducky Lucky,"" said the pancake. ""My dear pancake, don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you,"" said the duck. ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, from Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, I must run away from you too, Ducky Lucky,"" said the pancake, and with that it fell to rolling and rolling as fast as ever it could. When it had rolled a long, long time, it met a goose. Good day, pancake,"" said the goose. ""Good day, Goosey Poosey,"" said the pancake. ""My dear pancake, don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you,"" said the goose. ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, from Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, and Ducky Lucky, I must run away from you too, Goosey Poosey,"" said the pancake, and away it rolled. So when it had rolled a long, very long time, it met a gander. Good day, pancake,"" said the gander. ""Good day, Gander Pander,"" said the pancake. ""My dear pancake, don't roll so fast, but wait a bit and let me eat you,"" said the gander. ""When I have run away from Goody Poody and the husband and seven squalling children, from Manny Panny, and Henny Penny, and Cocky Locky, and Ducky Lucky, and Goosey Poosey, I must run away from you too, Gander Pander,"" said the pancake, and rolled and rolled as fast as it could. When it had rolled on a long, long time, it met a pig. Good day, pancake,"" said the pig. ""Good day, Piggy Wiggy,"" said the pancake, and began to roll on faster than ever. Nay, wait a bit,"" said the pig, ""you needn't be in such a hurry-scurry; we two can walk quietly together and keep each other company through the wood, because they say it isn't very safe there."" The pancake thought there might be something in that, and so they walked together through the wood; but when they had gone some distance, they came to a brook. The pig was so fat it wasn't much trouble for him to swim across, but the pancake couldn't get over. ""Sit on my snout,"" said the pig, ""and I will ferry you over."" The pancake did so. ""Ouf, ouf,"" grunted the pig, and swallowed the pancake in one gulp, and as the pancake couldn't get any farther -- well, you see we can't go on with this story any farther, either.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, Pannekaken, translated by H.

There was a wife bakin' bannocks, and there was a man cam and wanted ane o' them. And he said to the wife: ""Yer bannas is burnin': come awa' and I'1l turn them.""

They had twa kye, five hens and a cock, a cat and twa kittlins. The auld man lookit after the kye, and the auld wife span on the tow-rock. The kittlins aft grippit at the auld wife's spindle, as it tussled owre the hearth-stane. ""Sho, sho,"" she wad say, ""gae wa';"" and so it tussled about. Ae day, after parritch time, she thought she wad hae a bunnock. Sae she bakit twa aitmeal bunnocks, and set them to to the fire to harden. After a while, the auld man came in, and sat down aside the fire, and takes ane o' the bunnocks, and snappit it through the middle. When the tither ane sees this, it rins aff as fast as it could, and the auld wife after't, wi' the spindle in the tae hand and the tow-rock in the tither. But the wee bunnock wan awa', and out o' sight, and ran till it came to a guid muckle thack house, and ben it ran boldly to the fireside; and there were three tailors sitting on a muckle table. When they saw the wee bunnock come ben, they jumpit up, and gat in ahint the goodwife, that was cardin' tow ayont the fire. ""Hout,"" quo' she, ""be na fleyt; it's but a wee bunnock.

Up she gets wi' the tow-cards, and the tailor wi' the goose, and the twa prentices, the ane wi' the muckle shears, and the tither wi' the lawbrod; but it jinkit them, and ran round about the fire; and ane o' the prentices, thinking to snap it wi' the shears, fell i' the ase-pit. The tailor cuist the goose, and the goodwife the tow-cards; but a' wadna do. The bunnock wan awa', and ran till it came to a wee house at the roadside; and in it rins, and there was a weaver sittin' on the loom, and the wife winnin' a clue o' yarn. ""Tibby,"" quo' he, ""what's tat?"" ""Oh,"" quo' she, ""it's a wee bunnock."" ""It's weel come,"" quo' he, ""for our sowens were but thin the day. Grip it, my woman; grip it."" ""Ay,"" quo' she; ""what recks! That's a clever bunnock. Kep, Willie; kep, man."" ""Hout,"" quo' Willie, ""cast the clue at it."" But the bunnock whipit round about, and but the floor, and aff it gaed, and owre the knowe, like a new-tarred sheep or a daft yell cow. And forrit it runs to the niest house, and ben to the fireside; and there was the goodwife kirnin'. ""Come awa', wee bunnock,"" quo' she; ""I'se hae ream and bread the day."" But the wee bunnock whipit round about the kirn, and the wife after't, and i' the hurry she had near-hand coupit the kirn. And afore she got it set right again, the wee bunnock was aff, and down the brae to the mill; and in it ran. The miller was siftin' meal i' the trough; but, looking up: "" Ay,"" quo' he, ""it's a sign o' plenty when ye're rinnin' about, and naebody to look after ye. But I like a bunnock and cheese. Come your wa's ben, and I'll gie ye a night's quarters."" But the bunnock wadna trust itsel' wi' the miller and his cheese. Sae it turned and ran its wa's out; but the miller didna fash his head wi't. So it toddled awa', and ran till it came to the smithy; and in it rins, and up to the studdy. The smith was making horse-nails. Quo' he: ""I like a bicker o' guid yill and a weel-toastit bunnock. Come your wa's in by here."" But the bunnock was frightened when it heard about the yill, and turned and aff as hard as it could, and the smith after't, and cuist the hammer. But it whirlt awa', and out o' sight in a crack, and ran till it came to a farm-house wi' a guid muckle peat-stack at the end o't. Ben it rins to the fireside. The goodman was clovin' lint, and the goodwife hecklin'. ""O Janet,"" quo' he, ""there's a wee bunnock; I'se hae the hauf o't."" ""Weel, John, I'se hae the tither hauf. Hit it owre the back wi' the clove."" But the bunnock playt jink-about. ""Hout, tout,"" quo' the wife, and gart the heckle flee at it. But it was owre clever for her. And aff and up the burn it ran to the niest house, and whirlt its wa's ben to the fireside. The goodwife was stirrin' the sowens, and the goodman plettin' sprit-binnings for the kye. ""Ho, Jock,"" quo' the goodwife, ""come here. Thou's aye crying about a wee bunnock. Here's ane. Come in, haste ye, and I'1l help thee to grip it."" ""Ay, mither, whaur is't ?"" ""See there. Rin owre o' that side."" But the bunnock ran in ahint the goodman's chair. Jock fell amang the sprits. The goodman cuist a binning, and the goodwife the spurtle. But it was owre clever for Jock and her baith. It was aff and out o' sight in a crack, and through among the whins, and down the road to the niest house, and in, and ben to the fireside. The folk were just sittin' down to their sowens, and the goodwife scartin' the pat. ""Losh,"" quo' she, ""there's a wee bunnock come in to warm itsel' at our fireside."" ""Steek the door,"" quo' the goodman, ""and we'll try to get a grip o't."" When the bunnock heard that, it ran but the house, and they after't wi' their spunes, and the goodman cuist his bunnat. But it whirlt awa', and ran, and better ran, till it came to another house; and when it gaed ben, the folk were just gaun to their beds. The goodman was castin' aff his breeks, and the goodwife rakin' the fire. ""What's tat?"" quo' he. ""O,"" quo' she, ""it's a wee bunnock."" Quo' he, ""I could eat the hauf o't, for a' the brose I hae suppit."" ""Grip it,"" quo' the wife, "" and I'll hae a bit too."" ""Cast your breaks at it -- kep -- kep!"" The goodman cuist the breeks, and had near-hand smoor't it . But it warsl't out, and ran, and the goodman after't, wanting the breeks; and there was a clean chase owre the craft park, and up the wunyerd, and in amang the whins; and the goodman lost it, and had to come his wa's trottin' hame hauf-nakit. But now it was grown dark, and the wee bunnock couldna see; but it gaed into the side o' a muckle whin bush, and into a tod's hole. The tod had gotten nae meat for twa days. ""O welcome, welcome,"" quo' the tod, and snappit it in twa i' the middle. And that was the end o' the wee bunnock. At the conclusion, Grannie would look round upon her little audience, and add the following, by way of moral: ""Now, weans, an ye live to grow muckle, be na owre lifted up about onything, nor owre sair cuisten down; for ye see the folk were a' cheated, and the puir tod got the bunnock.""",Scotland,"Source: Robert Chambers, Popular Rhymes of Scotland, new edition (London and Edinburgh: W. and R.

Type 2031C: The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,A Bridegroom for Miss Mole,"Down under the earth, near this mighty colossus, lived a soft-furred mole and his wife. One day a daughter was born to them. It was the most wonderful mole baby that ever was known. The father was so proud of his lovely offspring that he determined to marry her only to the grandest thing in the whole universe. Nothing else would satisfy his pride in the beautiful creature he called his own. Father Mole sought long and hard to find out where and what, in all nature, was considered the most wonderful. He called in his neighbors and talked over the matter with them. Then he visited the king of the moles and asked the wise ones in his court to decide for him. One and all agreed that the Great Blue Sky was above everything else in glory and greatness. So up to the Sky the Mole Father went and offered his daughter to be the bride of the Great Blue, telling how, with his vast azure robe, the Sky had the reputation, both on the earth and under it, of being the greatest thing in the universe. But, much to the Mole Father's surprise, the Sky declined. ""No, I am not the greatest. I must refer you to the Sun. He controls me, for he can make it day or night as he pleases. Only when he rises, can I wear my bright colors. When he goes down, darkness covers the world, and men do not see me at all, but the stars instead. Better take your charming daughter to him."" So to the Sun went Mr. Mole and though afraid to look directly into his face, he made his plea. He would have the Sun marry his attractive daughter. But the mighty luminary, that usually seemed so fierce, dazzling men's eyesight and able to burn up the very grass of the field, seemed suddenly very modest. Instead of accepting at once the offer, the Sun said to the father, ""Alas! I am not master. The Cloud is greater than I, for he is able to cover me up and make me invisible for days and weeks. I am not as powerful as you think me to be. Let me advise you to offer your daughter to the Cloud."" Surprised at this, the Mole Father looked quite disappointed. Now he was in doubt as to what time he had best propose to the Cloud, -- when it was silvery white and glistening in a summer afternoon, or when it was black and threatening a tempest. However, his ambition to get for his daughter the mightiest possible bridegroom prompted him to wait until the lightnings flashed and the thunder rolled. Then, appearing before the terrible dark Cloud that shot out fire, he told of the charms of his wonderful daughter and offered her as bride. ""And why do you come to me?"" asked the Cloud, its face inky black with the wrath of a storm and its eyes red with the fires of lightning. ""Because you are not only the greatest thing in the universe, but you have proved it by your terrible power,"" replied the Father Mole. At this the Cloud ceased its rolling, stopped its fire and thunder and almost laughed. ""So far from being the greatest thing in the world, I am not even my own master. See already how the Wind is driving me. Soon I shall be invisible, dissolved in air. Let me commend you to the Wind. The Master of the Cloud will make a grand son-in-law."" Thereupon Papa Mole waited until the Wind calmed down, after blowing away the clouds. Then telling of his daughter's accomplishments and loveliness, he made proffer of his only child as bride to the Wind. But the Wind was not half so proud as the Mole Father had expected to find him. Very modest, almost bashful seemed the Wind, as he confessed that before Miryek, the colossal stone image, his power was naught. ""Why, I smite that Great Stone Face and its eyes do not even blink. I roar in his ears, but he minds it not. I try to make him sneeze, but he will not. Smite him as I may, he still stands unmoved and smiling. Alas, no. I am not the grandest thing in the universe, while Miryek stands. Go to him. He alone is worthy to marry your daughter."" By this time the Mole Father was not only footsore and weary, but much discouraged also. Evidently all appreciated his shining daughter; but would he be able, after all, to get her a worthy husband? He rested himself a while and then proceeded to Miryek, the colossus of granite as large as a lighthouse, its head far up in the air, but with ears ready to hear. The Mole Father squeaked out compliments to the image as being by common confession the greatest thing on earth. He presented his request for a son-in-law and then in detail mentioned the accomplishments of his daughter, sounding her praises at great length. Indeed, he almost ruined his case by talking so long. With stony patience, Miryek listened to the proud father with a twinkle in his white granite eyes. When his lips moved, he was heard to say, ""Fond Parent, what you say is true. I am great. I care not for the sky day or night, for I remain the same in daylight and darkness. I fear not the sun, that cannot melt me, nor the frost that is not able to make me crumble. Cold or hot, in summer or in winter time, I remain unchanged. The clouds come and go, but they cannot move me. Their fire and noise, lightning and thunder, I fear not. Yes, I am great."" Then the stone lips closed again. ""You will make, then, a good bridegroom for my daughter? You will marry her, I understand?"" asked the proud father as his hopes began to rise, though he was still doubtful. ""I would gladly do so, if I were greatest. But I am not,"" said Miryek. ""Down under my feet is the Mole. He digs with his shovel-like hands and makes burrows day and night. His might I cannot resist. Soon he shall undermine my base and I shall topple down and lie like common stone along the earth. Yes I by universal confession, the Mole is the greatest thing in the universe and to him I yield. Better marry your daughter to him."" So after all his journeying, the lovely daughter's father sought no further. Advised on all sides, and opinion being unanimous, he found out that the Mole was the greatest thing in the universe. His daughter's bridegroom was found at home and of the same family of creatures. He married her to a young and handsome Mole, and great was the joy and rejoicing at the wedding. The pair were well-mated and lived happily ever afterward.",Korea,"Source: William Elliot Griffis, The Unmannerly Tiger and Other Korean Tales (New York: Thomas Y.

Type 2031C: The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,A Story on Caste,"""O Chando, we understand that you are the greatest being in the world and we have come to marry our daughter to you."" Chando answered, ""I fancy there is some one greater than I."" ""Who is he?"" asked the parents. ""The cloud is greater than I, for it can hide my face and quench my rays."" At this the father and mother hurried off with their daughter in search of the cloud, and when they found him, told him that they had brought their daughter to give him to wife, as he was the greatest being in the world. ""I may be great,"" said the cloud, ""but there is a greater than I, the wind. The wind rises and blows me away in a minute."" So they went in search of the wind and when they found him, explained to him why they had brought him their daughter. The wind said, ""I am strong but there are stronger than I. The mountains are stronger. I can blow things down or whirl them away, but I cannot move the mountains."" So on they went to the mountain and explained their errand. The mountain said, ""I am great but there are more powerful than I. The ground-rat is more powerful, for however high I may be the ground-rats burrow holes in me and I cannot resist them."" The poor parents by this time began to feel rather discouraged, but still they made up their minds to persevere and went on to look for the ground-rat. They found him and offered him their daughter in marriage, but the ground-rat denied that he was the most powerful being on earth. The Musahars were more powerful for they lived by digging out ground-rats and eating them. The hapless couple went home very dejectedly, reflecting that they had begun by despising their own caste and had gone in search of something greater and had ended where they began. So they arranged to marry their daughter to a man of their own caste after all. Moral. You should not despise your own caste or race; you cannot help what caste you are born into. A Santal may learn to read and write and associate with men of good position and thereby his mind may be perverted. He may wish to change his caste and become a Sadhu, or a Kherwar, or a Boistab, or a Mussulman, or a Christian or anything else; but people will still know him for a beef-eating Santal. If he becomes a Christian, no one will think him the equal of a Saheb or a Brahman; no Saheb will marry his daughter or give him his daughter in marriage. Remember what happened to the Musahar, who despised his own caste. God caused you to be born in a certain caste. He and not we made the different castes, and He knows what is good and bad for us.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 51, pp. 168-70.",NA,NA

When she had come to the age of womanhood, the monk said to her, ""My dear daughter, you are quite grown up, and you absolutely must have a husband; choose then, one to suit yourself, so that I may unite you to him."" ""Since you leave me free to choose,"" she replied, ""I wish for my husband, he who is the most powerful in the world."" ""Perhaps you would like the sun?"" said he; and he went to find the sun, and said to it, ""O! thou who art so essentially great, I have a daughter who desires to have for a husband he who is the most powerful in the world; would you be willing to marry her?"" ""I will show you someone who is more powerful than I,"" said the sun. ""It is the cloud which obscures me, and makes my rays pale and tarnishes the splendor of my fires.""

Type 2031C: The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Mouse Metamorphosed into a Maid,"The mouse, indeed, was sadly bruised. Although, as neighbors, we are used To be more kind to many others, The Brahmins treat the mice as brothers. The notion haunts their heads, that when The soul goes forth from dying men, It enters worm, or bird, or beast, As Providence or Fate is pleased; And on this mystery rests their law, Which from Pythagoras they're said to draw. And hence the Brahmin kindly pray'd To one who knew the wizard's trade, To give the creature, wounded sore, The form in which it lodged before. Forthwith the mouse became a maid, Of years about fifteen; A lovelier was never seen. She would have waked, I ween, In Priam's son, a fiercer flame Than did the beauteous Grecian dame. Surprised at such a novelty, The Brahmin to the damsel cried, ""Your choice is free; For every he Will seek you for his bride."" Said she, ""Am I to have a voice? The strongest, then, shall be my choice."" ""O sun!"" the Brahmin cried, ""this maid is thine, And thou shalt be a son-in-law of mine."" ""No,"" said the sun, ""this murky cloud, it seems, In strength exceeds me, since he hides my beams; And him I counsel you to take."" Again the reverend Brahmin spake -- ""O cloud, on-flying with thy stores of water, Pray wast thou born to wed my daughter?"" ""Ah, no, alas! for, you may see, The wind is far too strong for me. My claims with Boreas' to compare, I must confess, I do not dare."" ""O wind,"" then cried the Brahmin, vex'd, And wondering what would hinder next, -- ""Approach, and, with thy sweetest air, Embrace -- possess -- the fairest fair."" The wind, enraptured, thither blew; -- A mountain stopp'd him as he flew, To him now pass'd the tennis-ball, And from him to a creature small. Said he, ""I'd wed the maid, but that I've had a quarrel with the rat. A fool were I to take the bride From one so sure to pierce my side."" The rat! It thrill'd the damsel's ear; The name at once seem'd sweet and dear. The rat! 'Twas one of Cupid's blows; The like full many a maiden knows; But all of this beneath the rose. One smacketh ever of the place Where first he show'd the world his face. Thus far the fable's clear as light; But, if we take a nearer sight, There lurks within its drapery Somewhat of graceless sophistry; For who, that worships e'en the glorious sun, Would not prefer to wed some cooler one? And doth a flea's exceed a giant's might, Because the former can the latter bite? And, by the rule of strength, the rat Had sent his bride to wed the cat; From cat to dog, and onward still To wolf or tiger, if you will: Indeed, the fabulist might run A circle backward to the sun. -- But to the change the tale supposes, -- In learned phrase, metempsychosis. The very thing the wizard did Its falsity exposes -- If that indeed were ever hid. According to the Brahmin's plan, The proud aspiring soul of man, And souls that dwell in humbler forms Of rats and mice, and even worms, All issue from a common source, And, hence, they are the same of course. -- Unequal but by accident Of organ and of tenement, They use one pair of legs, or two, Or e'en with none contrive to do, As tyrant matter binds them to. Why, then, could not so fine a frame Constrain its heavenly guest To wed the solar flame? A rat her love possess'd. In all respects, compared and weigh'd, The souls of men and souls of mice Quite different are made, -- Unlike in sort as well as size. Each fits and fills its destined part As Heaven doth well provide; Nor witch, nor fiend, nor magic art, Can set their laws aside.",Jean de La Fontaine,"Source: Jean de La Fontaine, The Fables of Fontaine, translated from the French by Elizur Wright; a new edition with notes by J.

Type 2031C: The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Rats and Their Daughter,"Once near a lonely farmhouse surrounded by rice fields there lived a rat couple. They were highly regarded by their own kind and very prosperous. One day, in addition to their many other children, a little daughter was born to them. She was so dainty with her shiny gray fur, her broad little upright ears, and her glistening eyes, that her parents became quite proud of their little daughter. Day in and day out their only thoughts were how they might prepare a magnificent future for her. When the little rat came of age, both parents came to the conclusion that only the most powerful being in the entire world should be her husband. Once they were discussing this matter with a neighbor, and he said, ""If you want to give your daughter in marriage to the most powerful being, you must choose the sun as your son-in-law, for without question, no one equals the sun in power. The rat couple saw that this was true, and without hesitation they made their way to the sun and presented to him their proposal that he should marry their daughter. The sun replied, ""I am much indebted to you that you have come so far, and that you have the kind intention to give me your daughter in marriage, but please tell me just why you have chosen me to be your son-in-law."" The rats said, ""We would like to give our daughter in marriage to the most powerful being in the world, and without dispute you are that one. Therefore we have chosen you to be our son-in-law."" Then the sun said, ""What you say is not without foundation, but there is a being more powerful than I, and it is he to whom you must give your daughter."" The rats replied, ""Can there in truth be someone more powerful than you?"" The sun said, ""When I want to shine on the earth, a cloud often comes by and covers me up, and my rays are unable either to penetrate it or to frighten it away. I am powerless against the cloud. Thus you must go to the cloud and make him your son-in-law."" The rats saw that it was so, and they went to the cloud. After they had presented their proposal to him, the cloud said, ""You are in error if you think that I am the most powerful being. I do indeed have the power to cover the sun, but I am powerless against the wind. When he begins to blow, he drives me away and tears me to pieces. There is nothing I can do against him."" So the rats went to the wind and made the proposal to him that he should marry their daughter, whom they wanted to give in marriage to the most powerful being. But the wind said, ""You are in error. I do indeed have the power to drive away the cloud, but I am powerless against the wall that people build to hold me back. I can neither blow through it nor do anything to it. The wall is much more powerful than I."" So the rats again set forth and came to the wall, to whom, in a similar manner, they made their request. The wall replied, ""It is indeed true that I have the power to resist the wind, but there is a rat that is undermining me, boring into me and making holes throughout me, and there is nothing I can do to stop him. I am powerless against the rat. It would be better for you to take the rat for your son-in-law than to choose me!"" This pleased the rats, for they saw that the wall was right. They returned home and married their dear daughter to a handsome young rat. They never regretted this, for their daughter lived happily and contentedly with a man of her own kind. And the parents, who once had wanted to elevate her so high, shared in her happiness and satisfaction.",Japan,"Source: David Brauns, ""Die Ratten und ihr Töchterlein,"" Japanische Märchen und Sagen (Leipzig: Verlag von Wilhelm Friedrich, 1885), pp. 85-87.",Link to additional Folktales from Japan.,Translated from the German by D.

It took after the miller, and from day to day its paunch grew bigger. It became as round as a cucumber and as fat as a candle. One day, looking at its round, sleek figure, the rat said to itself, ""Behold I am so beautiful and strong. Why should I not go and pay a visit to God? He is sure to receive me."" No sooner said than done. Leaving the mill, he started on his journey to God. After traveling a few days and not coming nearer to God, he stopped and said, ""Methinks that either God lives much farther away than I believed, or I have lost my way. I will go to the sun and ask where God is."" Coming to the sun, the rat asked, ""Where is God?"" ""Off with you,"" shouted the sun. ""I have no time for idle talkers."" The rat went to the clouds and asked them, ""Where is God?"" ""We cannot stop to bandy words with the like of you."" Away the rat went and came to the wind. ""Where is God?"" asked the rat.

Type 2031C: The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Transformed Mouse Seeks a Bridegroom,"On the shore of the Ganges there was a hermitage filled with holy men dedicated to prayer, self denial, repentance, the study of holy scriptures, fasting, and meditation. They drank only small amounts of very pure water, and mortified their bodies with a diet of bulbs, roots, fruits, and water plants. Their only clothing were loincloths made from tree bark. The father of the hermitage was named Yajnavalkya. He had just finished bathing in the Ganges and was about to rinse out his mouth when a little mouse fell from a falcon's beak into his hand. After looking at it, he set it onto a fig leaf, bathed himself once more, rinsed out his mouth, and performed his penitential and other rituals. Then through the power of his holiness he transformed the mouse into a girl. Taking her home with him to his hermitage, he said to his wife, who was childless, ""My dear, take her in place of a daughter. Bring her up with care!"" Thereafter she was reared, loved, and nurtured. When she was twelve years old, and the wife saw that she was ready for marriage, she said to her husband, ""Listen, husband, do you not see that it is past time for our daughter's marriage?"" He said, ""What you say is quite right! So if she is willing, I will summon the exalted sun god and present her to him as a wife. His wife said, ""What could be said against that? Do it!"" Through the power of prayer and incantations the sun appeared without delay, saying, ""Holy man, why do you summon me?"" The man answered, ""Behold! Here stands my little daughter. If she will have you, take her as a wife!"" Having said this, he said to his daughter, ""Daughter, does this exalted one please you, this sun god who illuminates the three worlds?"" The daughter said, ""Father, he is too hot. I do not want him. Summon a better one!"" Hearing this, the wise man said to the sun, ""Exalted one, is there a being more powerful than you?"" The sun answered, ""Yes, there is a stronger one than I. The cloud, through whose cover I become invisible."" Then the wise man summoned the cloud and said to his daughter, ""Daughter, shall I give you to this one as a wife?"" She answered, ""He is black and cold. Therefore give me to another powerful being!"" Upon this the wise man asked the cloud, ""Listen, cloud! Is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The cloud answered, ""The wind is more powerful than I! Driven by the wind, I am scattered into a thousand pieces."" After hearing this, the wise man summoned the wind and said, ""Daughter, does the wind please you most of all as a husband?"" She answered, ""Father! He is entirely too inconstant. Summon a more powerful one instead!"" The wise man said, ""Wind, is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The wind said, ""The mountain is more powerful than I, for however strong I am, he still stands firmly against me."" Then the wise man summoned the mountain and said to the girl, ""Daughter, shall I give you to this one in marriage?"" She answered, ""Father, he is hard and rigid. Therefore give me to another one."" The wise man asked the mountain, ""Listen, king of the mountains, is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The mountain answered, ""The mice are more powerful than I, for they make holes in my body with violence."" With that the wise man summoned a mouse and showed him to her, saying, ""Daughter, shall I give you to him as a wife? Does this mouse king please you?"" Seeing him, she thought, ""He is of my own kind."" Her hair stood on end with pleasure, making her even more beautiful, and she said, ""Father, make me into a mouse and give me to him as a wife so I can fulfill the domestic duties prescribed for my kind!"" Through the power of his holiness he transformed her into a little mouse and gave her to the other mouse as a wife. One of India's most influential contributions to world literature, The Panchatantra (also spelled Pañcatantra or Pañca-tantra) consists of five books of animal fables and magic tales (some 87 stories in all) that were compiled in their current form between the third and fifth centuries AD. It is believed that even then the stories were already ancient. The tales' self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes The Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning ""court scholar."" The fables of The Panchatantra found their way to Europe through oral folklore channels and by way of Persian and Arabic translations. They substantially influenced medieval writers of fables.",India (The Panchatantra),"Source: The Panchatantra, book 3.","I have used the following edition: ""Die verwandelte Maus soll sich einen Bräutigam wählen,"" Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen, aus dem Sanskrit übersetzt mit Einleitung und Anmerkungen von Theodor Benfey, vol. 2 (Leipzig: F.

The cloud responded that the vole would find an even stronger being in the wind, who had the power to push the cloud away at will. Next the vole journeyed to the wind, explaining that he understood him to be the most powerful creature of all, and wishing therefore to marry his daughter. ""You are mistaken,"" answered the wind. ""The wall is stronger than I. He can withstand my mightiest blast."" ""Then I withdraw my request for you daughter's hand,"" replied the vole. I will marry only into the mightiest family.""

Type 2032,2032,The Sexton's Nose,"A sexton, one day in sweeping the church, found a piece of money (it was a fifth of a cent) and deliberated with himself as to what he would buy with it. If he bought nuts or almonds, he was afraid of the mice; so at last he bought some roasted peas, and ate all but the last pea. This he took to a bakery nearby, and asked the mistress to keep it for him. She told him to leave it on a bench, and she would take care of it. When she went to get it, she found that the cock had eaten it. The next day the sexton came for the roast pea, and when he heard what had become of it, he said they must either return the roast pea or give him the cock. This they did, and the sexton, not having anyplace to keep it, took it to a miller's wife, who promised to keep it for him. Now she had a pig, which managed to kill the cock. The next day the sexton came for the cock, and on finding it dead, demanded the pig, and the woman had to give it to him. The pig he left with a friend of his, a pastry cook, whose daughter was to be married the next day. The woman was mean and sly, and killed the pig for her daughter's wedding, meaning to tell the sexton that the pig had run away. The sexton, however, when he heard it, made a great fuss, and declared that she must give him back his pig or her daughter. At last she had to give him her daughter, whom he put in a bag and carried away. He took the bag to a woman who kept a shop, and asked her to keep for him this bag, which he said contained bran. The woman by chance kept chickens, and she thought she would take some of the sexton's bran and feed them. When she opened the bag she found the young girl, who told her how she came there. The woman took her out of the sack, and put in her stead a dog. The next day the sexton came for his bag, and putting it on his shoulder, started for the seashore, intending to throw the young girl in the sea. When he reached the shore, he opened the bag, and the furious dog flew out and bit his nose. The sexton was in great agony, and cried out, while the blood ran down his face in torrents, ""Dog, dog, give me a hair to put in my nose, and heal the bite."" The dog answered, ""Do you want a hair? Give me some bread."" The sexton ran to a bakery, and said to the baker, ""Baker, give me some bread to give the dog. The dog will give a hair. The hair I will put in my nose, and cure the bite.""

Type 20C (formerly type 2033): The End of the World (The Sky Is Falling In),2033,Brother Rabbit Takes Some Exercise,"One night while the little boy was sitting in Uncle Remus's cabin, waiting for the old man to finish his hoe-cake, and refresh his memory as to the further adventures of Brother Rabbit, his friends and his enemies, something dropped upon the top of the house with a noise like the crack of a pistol. The little boy jumped, but Uncle Remus looked up and exclaimed, ""Ah-yi!"" in a tone of triumph. ""What was that, Uncle Remus?"" the child asked, after waiting a moment to see what else would happen. ""New from Jack Frost, honey. When that hickory-nut tree out there hears him coming, she begins to drop what she's got. I'm mighty glad,"" he continued, scraping the burnt crust from hi hoe-cake with an old case-knife. ""I'm mighty glad hickory nuts aren't as big and heavy as grindstones."" He waited a moment to see what effect this queer statement would have on the child. ""Yes, sir, I'm might glad, that I am. Because if hickory nuts were as big as grindstones, this here old calaboose would be leaking long before Christmas."" Just then another hickory nut dropped upon the roof, and the little boy jumped again. This seemed to amuse Uncle Remus, and he laughed until he was near to choking himself with his smoking hoe-cake. ""You are doing exactly what old Brer Rabbit did, I declare to gracious if you aren't,"" the old man cried, as soon as he could get his breath. ""Exactly for the world."" The child was immensely flattered, and at once he wanted to know how Brother Rabbit did. Uncle Remus was in such good humor that he needed no coaxing. He pushed his spectacles back on he forehead, wiped him mouth on his sleeve, and began: It came about that early one morning towards the fall of the year Brer Rabbit was stirring around in the woods after some bergamot to use for making him some hair grease. The wind was blowing so cold that it made him feel right frisky, and every time he heard the bushes rattle, it seemed to scare him. He was going on this way, hoppity-skippity, when by and by he heard Mr. Man cutting on a tree way off in the woods. He sat up, Brer Rabbit did, and listened first with one ear and then with the other. The man, he cut and cut, and Brer Rabbit, he listened and listened. By and by, while all this was going on, down came the tree: kubber-lang-bang-blam! Brer Rabbit, he took and jumped just like you jumped, and not only that, he made a break, he did, and he leaped out of as though the dogs were after him. ""Was he scared, Uncle Remus?"" asked the little boy. ""Scared! Who? Him? Shoo! Don't you fret yourself about Brer Rabbit, honey. In those days there was nothing going that could scare Brer Rabbit. To be sure, he took care of himself, and if you know anyone who refuses to take care of himself, I would mighty well like you to point him out. Indeed I would!"" Uncle Remus seemed to boil over wit argumentative indignation. Well then, he continued, Brer Rabbit ran until he sort of got heated up, and about the time he was getting ready to squat and catch his wind, who should he meet but Brer Coon going home after sitting up with old Brer Bull-Frog. Brer Coon saw him running, and he hailed him, ""What's your hurry, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Haven't got time to tarry."" ""Folks sick?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Trying out your suppleness?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Do pray, Brer Rabbit, tell me the news!"" ""Mighty big fuss back there in the woods. Haven't got time to tarry!"" This made Brer Coon feel might skittish, because he was far from home, and he just leaped out, he did, and he went a-boiling through the woods. Brer Coon hadn't gone far until he met Brer Fox. ""Hey, Brer Coon, where are you going?"" ""Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Going to the doctor?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" Do pry, Brer Coon, tell me the news."" Mighty queer racket back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry! With that, Brer Fox leaped out, he did, and fairly split the wind. He hadn't gone far until he met Brer Wolf. ""Hey, Brer Fox! Stop and rest yourself!"" ""Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Who is wanting the doctor?"" ""No one, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry."" ""Do pray, Brer Fox, good or bad, tell me the news."" ""Mighty curious fuss back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry!"" With that, Brer Wolf shook himself loose from the face of the earth, and he didn't get far until he met Brer Bear. Brer Bear, he asked, and Brer Wolf made an answer, and by and by Brer Bear snorted and ran off. And, bless gracious, it wasn't long before the last one of the creatures was a-skaddling through the woods as though the Old Boy were after them, and all because Brer Rabbit heard Mr. Man cut a tree down. They ran and they ran, Uncle Remus went on, until they them to Brer Terrapin's house, and they sort of slacked up, because they had nearly lost their wind. Brer Terrapin, he up an asked them where they were going, and they said there was a monstrous, terrifying racket back there in the woods. Brer Terrapin, he asked what it sounded like. One said he didn't know; the other said he didn't know; and they all said they didn't know. This made old Brer Terrapin laugh way down in his insides, and he up and said, ""You all can run along if you feel skittish,"" he said. ""After I cook my breakfast and wash up the dishes, and if I get wind of any suspicious racket, maybe I might just take down my parasol and follow along after you,"" he said. When the creatures came to ask one another about who started the news, it went right back to Brer Rabbit, but low and behold, Brer Rabbit wasn't there! It turned out that Brer Coon was the one who had seen him last. Then they got to laying the blame of it on one or the other, until they almost began to fight, but then old Brer Terrapin, he up and said that if they wanted to straighten it out, they'd better go see Brer Rabbit. All the creatures agreed, the they started out for Brer Rabbit's house. When they got there, Brer Rabbit was sitting cross-legged on the front porch winking his eyes at the sun. Brer Bear spoke up, ""What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Fool who, Brer Bear?"" ""Me, Brer Rabbit, that's who."" ""This is the first time I've seen you today, Brer Bear, and you are more than welcome at that."" They all asked him and got the same answer, and then Brer Coon put in, ""What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?"" ""How did I fool you, Brer Coon?"" ""You made like there was a big racket, Brer Rabbit."" ""What kind of a racket, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Ah-yi! You should have asked me that first, Brer Coon."" ""I'm asking you now, Brer Rabbit."" ""Mr. Man cut a tree down, Brer Coon."" Of course this made Brer Coon feel like a natural-born slink, and it wasn't long before all the creatures made their bows to Brer Rabbit and moseyed off home. ""Brother Rabbit had the best of it all along,"" said the little boy, after waiting to see whether there was a sequel to the story. ""Oh, did he ever!"" exclaimed Uncle Remus. ""Brer Rabbit was a mighty man in those days.""",African American,"Source: Joel Chandler Harris, Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1883), no. 20, pp. 108-13.",NA,Dialect normalized by D.

Type 20C (formerly type 2033): The End of the World (The Sky Is Falling In),2033,The Cock and the Hen That Went to Dovrefjell,"Once upon a time there was a hen that had flown up and perched on an oak tree for the night. When the night came, she dreamed that unless she got to Dovrefjell, the world would come to an end. So that very minute she jumped down, and set out on her way. When she had walked a bit she met a cock. ""Good day, Cocky-Locky,"" said the hen. ""Good day, Henny-Penny,"" said the cock. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the hen. ""Who told you that, Henny-Penny?"" asked the cock. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the cock. Well, they walked on a good bit, and then they met a duck. ""Good day, Ducky-Lucky,"" said the cock. ""Good day, Cocky-Locky"" said the duck. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the cock. ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny,"" said the cock. ""Who told you that, Henny-Penny?"" asked the duck. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the duck. So they went off together, and after a bit they met a goose. ""Good day, Goosey-Poosey,"" said the duck. ""Good day, Ducky-Lucky,"" said the goose. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the duck. ""Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"" asked the goose. ""Cocky-Locky."" ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny."" ""How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"" said the goose. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night, Goosey-Poosey,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the goose. Now when they had all walked along for a bit, a fox met them. ""Good day, Foxy-Cocksy,"" said the goose. ""God day, Goosey-Poosey."" ""Where are you going, Foxy-Cocksy?"" ""Where are you going yourself, Goosey-Poosey?"" ""I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the goose. ""Who told you that, Goosey-Poosey?"" asked the fox. ""Ducky-Lucky."" ""Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"" ""Cocky-Locky."" ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny."" ""How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"" ""I sat in the oak and dreamed last night, that if we don't get to Dovrefjell, the world will come to an end,"" said the hen. ""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the fox. ""The world won't come to an end if you don't go there. No, come home with me to my den. That's far better, for it's warm and jolly there."" Well, they went home with the fox to his den, and when they got inside, the fox laid on lots of fuel, so that they all got very sleepy. The duck and the goose, they settled themselves down in a corner, but the cock and hen flew up on a post. So when the goose and duck were well asleep, the fox took the goose and laid him on the embers, and roasted him. The hen smelled the strong roast meat, and sprang up to a higher peg, and said, half asleep, ""Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"" ""Oh, stuff!"" said the fox. ""It's only the smoke driven down the chimney. Go to sleep again, and hold your tongue."" So the hen went off to sleep again. Now the fox had hardly got the goose well down his throat, before he did the very same with the duck. He took and laid him on the embers, and roasted him for a dainty bit. Then the hen woke up again, and sprang up to a higher peg still. ""Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"" she said again, and when she got her eyes open, and came to see how the fox and eaten two of them, both the goose and the duck. So she flew up to the highest peg of all, and perched there, and peeped up through the chimney. ""Nay, nay, just see what a lovely lot of geese are flying over there,"" she said to the fox. Out ran Reynard to fetch a fat roast. But while he was gone, the hen woke up the cock and told him how it had gone with Goosey-Poosey and Ducky-Lucky. And so Cocky-Locky and Henny-Penny flew out through the chimney, and if they hadn't got to Dovrefjell, it surely would have been all over with the world.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Popular Tales from the North, translated by George Webbe Dasent, new edition (New York: G.

Type 20C (formerly type 2033): The End of the World (The Sky Is Falling In),2033,The End of the World,"""How do you know, Henny Penny?"" says he. ""Oh, a nut fell on my tail just now."" ""If that be so, we have nothing for it but to run away."" So they ran till they met the duck. ""Oh, Ducky Lucky, the end of the world is come."" ""How do you know, Cocky Locky?"" ""Oh, a nut fell just now on Henny Penny's tail."" ""If that be so, we must run for it."" When they were pegging off, they met the goose. ""Oh, Goosey Poosey, the end of the world is come."" ""How do you know, Ducky Lucky?"" ""A nut fell on Henny Penny's tail just now."" ""If that be the case, we are done for."" They met the fox. ""Oh, Foxy Coxy, the world is come to an end."" ""How do you know that, Goosey Poosey?"" ""Oh, a nut fell on Henny Penny's tail."" ""Then let us be off."" So they got into the wood, and says Foxy Coxy, ""Let me count if all are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; Ducky Lucky, three; Cocky Locky, four; Henny Penny, five. Number five, I'll put you in a safe place where the end of the world won't hurt you."" So he took Henny Penny behind a hush and put her out of pain. ""Now,"" says he, coming back, ""let us count if all the rest are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; etc., etc. Number four, I'll put you in a place where you'll be safe when the end of the world comes."" He took him behind another bush, etc., etc., etc. ""Now let me see if all the rest are here. I, Foxy Coxy, one; etc., etc., etc."" and so on till he put the fear of the world's end out of every one of them. In the yard he passed the house dog who was sitting in front of his kennel. ""Hallo, Chaton!"" cried the dog. ""Where are you going to in such a hurry?"" ""I am fleeing the country,"" answered Chaton. ""I have just heard the sounding of the last trump! The end of the world is at hand!"" ""If that is so,"" said the dog, ""I would like to run away too. May I come with you?"" ""Certainly,"" answered Chaton. ""Seat yourself on my beautiful curly tail."" So the dog perched himself on the cat s tail, and off they went together. A little farther on they came to the farm gate, and there, perched on the topmost rail, was the cock. ""Whither away, Chaton?"" asked the cock. ""You seem to be in haste."" ""Yes,"" said Chaton. ""I have heard the last trump, which proves that the world is coming to an end, and I want to get safely away before that happens."" ""Take me with you, Chaton dear,"" said the cock. ""By all means,"" answered the cat. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail beside the dog."" So the cock perched himself on Chaton's tail, and now there were two passengers. Away went the cat even faster than before, so as to make up for lost time, and presently they passed a rabbit who was nibbling the grass in a field. ""Chaton, Chaton,"" cried the rabbit, ""why are you running so quickly?"" ""Don't stop me!"" answered the cat. ""I've heard the last trump! The end of the world is coming!"" ""Oh, dear me!"" cried the rabbit. ""What an unfortunate thing! Don't leave me here, Chaton, for I am afraid to face the end of the world."" ""Very well,"" said Chaton. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the cock, and I'll take you with me."" So the rabbit also perched himself on the cat's tail, and now there were three of them riding there. Off went the cat again, but not so quickly this time, because of the weight on his tail, and before very long he came to a pond by the side of which a goose was standing. ""Now then, now then, what's the hurry?"" asked the goose. ""If you run so fast you'll overheat your blood and die of a fever."" ""It's all very well to scoff,"" answered the cat, ""but you must know that the end of the world is coming. I have heard the last trump sound!"" ""My goodness!"" said the goose. ""This is dreadful! Take me with you, Chaton, and I'll be grateful for ever."" ""Very well,"" said the cat. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the fox and the rabbit."" So the goose also perched herself on the cat's tail, so now there were four passengers, and that made five altogether who were running away to escape the end of the world. All that day the cat kept on running, and towards dusk they came to a forest. ""This seems a good place to rest,"" said Chaton. ""Now then, master cock, fly to the top of a tree and see if you can espy a house in which we can take shelter."" The cock flew to the top of a high tree and from there he saw a number of lights twinkling in the distance. The five fugitives thereupon set off in the direction from which the lights shone, and before long they came to a little village. All the people of the village had left their houses and were gathered together in the square, round a man dressed all in red, with a big red feather in his cap, who was addressing them. Chaton and his companions pressed close to the edge of the crowd and were just in time to hear these words: ""Whoever finds the ring,"" said the man with the red feather,"" and places it on the table in my palace tomorrow before dawn, shall have the five bags of gold which hang on my saddle bow."" Having said this, the man in red mounted his horse and rode away. Chaton went up to a little peasant who was standing in the crowd. ""Tell me, gossip,"" said he, ""who is the man with the red feather, and what's all this about a ring and five bags of gold?"" ""Why,"" said the peasant, ""the man in red is the king of this country. He had a valuable ring which was kept in a tiny wooden case on the table by his bed. This afternoon a magpie flew in through the window, snatched up the case, and bore it away to its nest in the topmost boughs of the walnut tree on the village green. The king wants his ring back again, and will give the five bags of gold to anybody who will recover it for him."" ""I see,"" said Chaton; ""and why don't you climb the walnut tree and get the ring?"" ""Because I have too much respect for my neck,"" answered the peasant, ""and so has everybody else here. The boughs at the top of the tree where the nest is are so thin and slender that they would not bear the weight of a child, let alone a grown man. Gold is good, but whole limbs are better, that's what I say!"" ""And I!"" ""And I!"" echoed other villagers who had been listening to this conversation. ""In my belief you are quite right,"" said Chaton seriously. ""Let the king risk his own life if he is so anxious to recover his ring."" But afterwards, when he had withdrawn with his companions to the shelter of the wood, he sang a different tune. ""My friends,"" said he, ""our fortunes are made! As soon as all is quiet I will climb the tree and get the ring; then you shall sit on my tail again and we'll all go off together to the king's palace and get the bags of gold!"" He danced for joy, and the dog and the cock and the goose and the rabbit danced with him. An hour afterwards the cat climbed the tree and came down safely with the little wooden box. The rabbit gnawed it open with his teeth, and sure enough there was the ring inside it. ""Now,"" said Chaton, ""we will all go to the king's palace, but I am very tired with running all day. I propose that the dog takes a turn at carrying us."" This was agreed. The other four got on to the dog's back and clung there while he ambled off as fast as he could along the road towards the palace. Just before dawn they came to a wide river. Now it was the turn of the goose to work for the common good. She was quite used to the water, and one by one she took the other animals across on her back. Shortly afterwards they arrived at the king's palace, and the cock flew up through the open window of the king's room with the ring in his beak, and placed it on the table by the bed. Then he awoke the king with a loud crow and claimed the reward, which was willingly given. In great glee at their good fortune the animals went on their way, each with his bag of gold, and every one of them had by this time quite forgotten his fear about the coming of the end of the world. They went on and on until they came to a place where five ways met. Then Chaton said, ""Here we are at the parting of the ways. Let us each choose a road, and part good friends."" At this moment there came along a pig with a knife and fork stuck in his back. In his right ear was salt; in his left ear pepper, and mustard was on his tail, so that everybody who was hungry had only to cut themselves a slice of meat and sit down to feast. Our friends gladly availed themselves of this good chance, and I who tell you this story would willingly have done the same, but as soon as I went up to the pig, he ran at me with his head down and sent me flying through the air, and through the window of my house, where I fell into the chair in which I am now sitting, finishing this story of the wonderful adventures of Chaton, the dog, the cock, the rabbit, and the goose.",Ireland Flanders,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, The Fireside Stories of Ireland (Dublin: M'Glashan and Gill, 1870), p. 25.

Type 20C (formerly type 2033): The End of the World (The Sky Is Falling In),2033,The Timid Hare and the Flight of the Beasts,"Once upon a time when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta [the future Buddha] came to life as a young lion. And when fully grown he lived in a wood. At this time there was near the Western Ocean a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. A certain hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at the foot of a vilva tree. One day this hare, after feeding, came and lay down beneath the young palm tree. And the thought struck him, ""If this earth should be destroyed, what would become of me?"" And at this very moment a ripe vilva fruit fell on a palm leaf. At the sound of it, the hare thought, ""This solid earth is collapsing,"" and starting up he fled, without so much as looking behind him. Another hare saw him scampering off, as if frightened to death, and asked the cause of his panic flight. ""Pray, don't ask me,"" he said. The other hare cried, ""Pray, sir, what is it?"" and kept running after him. Then the hare stopped a moment and without looking back said, ""The earth here is breaking up."" And at this the second hare ran after the other. And so first one and then another hare caught sight of him running, and joined in the chase till one hundred thousand hares all took to flight together. They were seen by a deer, a boar, an elk, a buffalo, a wild ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion, and an elephant. And when they asked what it meant and were told that the earth was breaking up, they too took to flight. So by degrees this host of animals extended to the length of a full league. When the Bodhisatta saw this headlong flight of the animals, and heard the cause of it was that the earth was coming to an end, he thought, ""The earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must be some sound which was misunderstood by them. And if I don't make a great effort, they will all perish. I will save their lives."" So with the speed of a lion he got before them to the foot of a mountain, and lion-like roared three times. They were terribly frightened at the lion, and stopping in their flight stood all huddled together. The lion went in amongst them and asked why there were running away. ""The earth is collapsing,"" they answered. ""Who saw it collapsing?"" he said. ""The elephants know all about it,"" they replied. He asked the elephants. ""We don't know,"" they said, ""the lions know."" But the lions said, ""We don't know, the tigers know."" The tigers said, ""The rhinoceroses know."" The rhinoceroses said, ""The wild oxen know."" The wild oxen, ""the buffaloes."" The buffaloes, ""the elks."" The elks, ""the boars."" The boars, ""the deer."" The deer said, ""We don't know; the hares know."" When the hares were questioned, they pointed to one particular hare and said, ""This one told us."" So the Bodhisatta asked, ""Is it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?"" ""Yes, sir, I saw it,"" said the hare. ""Where,"" he asked, ""were you living, when you saw it?"" ""Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. For as I was lying beneath the shade of a palm sapling at the foot of a vilva tree, methought, 'If this earth should break up, where shall I go?' And at that very moment I heard the sound the breaking up of the earth, and I fled."" Thought the lion, ""A ripe vilva fruit evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made a 'thud,' and this hare jumped to the conclusion that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away. I will find out the exact truth about it."" So he reassured the herd of animals, and said, ""I will take the hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out by him. Until I return, do you stay here."" Then placing the hare on his back, he sprang forward with the speed of a lion, and putting the hare down in the palm grove, he said, ""Come, show us the place you meant."" ""I dare not, my lord,"" said the hare. ""Come, don't be afraid,"" said the lion. The hare, not venturing to go near the vilva tree, stood afar off and cried, ""Yonder, sir, is the place of dreadful sound,"" and so saying, he repeated the first stanza: After hearing what the hare said, the lion went to the foot of the vilva tree, and saw the spot where the hare had been lying beneath the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe vilva fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having carefully ascertained that the earth had not broken up, he placed the hare on his back and with the speed of a lion soon came again to the herd of beasts. Then he told them the whole story, and said, ""Don't be afraid."" And having thus reassured the herd of beasts, he let them go. Verily, if it had not been for the Bodhisatta at that time, all the beasts would have rushed into the sea and perished. It was all owing to the Bodhisatta that they escaped death.",India,"Source: The Jataka; or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births, edited by E. B.

Type 2034D,2034d,The Grain of Corn,"Once upon a time a farmer's wife was winnowing corn, when a crow, flying past, swooped off with a grain from the winnowing basket and perched on a tree close by to eat it. The farmer's wife, greatly enraged, flung a clod at the bird with so good an aim that the crow fell to the ground, dropping the grain of corn, which rolled into a crack in the tree. The farmer's wife, seeing the crow fall, ran up to it, and seizing it by the tail, cried, ""Give me back my grain of corn, or I will kill you!"" The wretched bird, in fear of death, promised to do so, but, lo and behold! when he came to search for the grain, it had rolled so far into the crack that neither by beak nor claw could he reach it. So he flew off to a woodman, and said: But the woodman refused to cut the tree; so the crow flew on to the king 's palace, and said: But the king refused to kill the man; so the crow flew on to the queen , and said: But the queen refused to coax the king; so the crow flew on till he met a snake, and said: But the snake refused to bite the queen; so the crow flew on till he met a stick, and said: But the stick refused to beat the snake; so the crow flew on till he saw a fire, and said: But the fire refused to burn the stick; so the crow flew on till he met some water, and said: But the water refused to quench the fire; so the crow flew on till he met an ox, and said: But the ox refused to drink the water; so the crow flew on till he met a rope, and said: But the rope wouldn't bind the ox; so the crow flew on till he met a mouse, and said: But the mouse wouldn't gnaw the rope; so the crow flew on until he met a cat, and said: The moment the cat heard the name of mouse, she was after it; for the world will come to an end before a cat will leave a mouse alone.",India,"Source: Flora Annie Steel, Tales of the Punjab: Told by the People (London and New York: Macmillan and Company, 1894), pp. 198ff.",The Little Blackbird (India).,NA
Type 2034D,2034d,The Little Blackbird,"There was once a little blackbird (the litia) who was the proud owner of three kauries, or shells. This bird used to come to a king and say, ""O king, I have three kauries, O king."" The king was so much annoyed by the continual chirping of the little bird that he ordered his servants to take the three kauries from the bird and to drive it away. But the bird would not leave the king, and so it began to say, ""My wealth has made you rich, O king. My wealth has made you rich, O king."" The king then ordered that the three kauries should be returned to the little blackbird. The bird then took the three kauries, and went to the seller of parched gram (a coarse pea), and with the three kauries she bought three grains of parched gram. Taking these the bird flew off and sat on a new cart which a carpenter was making, and there she started eating the gram. Having eaten two grains, she was about to eat the third, when it dropped from her beak and fell into a joint of the new cart, where she could not reach it. In great distress she appealed to the carpenter to take to pieces his cart that she might get at the grain she had lost. ""You silly little thing,"" said the carpenter. ""Do you suppose I am going to take to pieces my new cart to get at a single grain which you have dropped into the joint of the woodwork?"" The little blackbird then went to the king, and said to him that she had lost her grain, and asked him to order the carpenter to open his cart that she might get at her grain. ""You silly little thing,"" said the king. ""Do you suppose I am going to order the carpenter to open his cart that you may get one small grain?"" The little blackbird then went to the queen, and begged of her to persuade the king to order the carpenter to open the cart to let her get at the grain. But the queen also said, ""Get away, you silly thing."" Then the little blackbird went to a deer and said, ""Come, O deer, graze in the queen's garden, for she will not persuade the king, and the king will not order the carpenter, and the carpenter will not open the cart, and I cannot get at my grain."" But the deer would give to heed to the bird, and called her ""You silly little thing."" Then said the bird, ""I will go to the lathi (the strong, stout stick)."" To the lathi she went and said, ""Come, stout stick, strike the deer, for the deer will not graze in the queen's garden, and the queen will not persuade the king, and the king will not command the carpenter, and the carpenter will not open his cart, and I cannot get at my grain."" But the stick also would give no ear to the cry of the little blackbird, so she went at once to the fire; and she begged the fire to burn the stick, for the deer would not eat the queen's garden, and the queen would not persuade the king, the king would not command the carpenter, the carpenter would not break up his cart, and she could not get at her grain. But the fire also made light of the little bird's prayer. So she went next to the lake, and implored the lake to quench the fire, for the fire would not burn the stick, and the stick would not strike the deer, and the deer would not destroy the garden, and the queen would not persuade the king, and the king refused to command the carpenter, who also refused to open his cart, so that the bird could not get at her grain. But the lake refused to help the bird. She then went to a place where there were thousands of rats, and to the rats she presented her prayer that they should come and fill the lake with their diggings, for the lake would not quench the fire, etc., etc. But the rats also gave no attention to the wishes of the small blackbird. Then the bird went to a cat, and of the cat she implored that she should attack the rats, for the rats would not fill in the lake, and the lake would not quench the fire, etc., and she could not get at her grain. But the cat also was deaf to the prayers of the small blackbird. Then she went to the elephant, and of the elephant she implored that he would crush the cat, for the cat would not kill the rats, etc., etc., and she could not get at her grain. But the elephant treated her as did all the others. Then she went to an ant, and begged the wee ant to crawl into the elephant's ear, for the elephant would not crush the cat, etc., etc. and she could not get at her grain. But the ant also gave no heed to her prayer. Then at last she came to the crow, the most greedy of all creatures, and of the crow she begged that he should eat the ant. From sheer greed the crow consented to eat the ant; but the ant, seeing the crow about to eat it, went to crawl into the ear of the elephant, and the elephant, fearing the harm which the ant could do him, went to crush the cat; but the cat slipped away, and was about the destroy the rats, and they at once began to fill in the lake; and the lake, becoming alarmed, was about to quench the fire, when the fire began to burn the stick, and the stick began to beat the deer, so that the deer was about to destroy the queen's garden, when the queen began to persuade the king, and the king commanded the carpenter, and the carpenter opened his new cart; and the little blackbird found her grain, and happily taking it up she flew away, and quietly enjoyed her repast, and lived very happily ever after.",India,"Source: E.

So he went, till he came to a goodly place, abounding in vines and water, whither he carried her and pitched her a tent beside a great tree; and she betook herself to a place beside the tent and made her there an underground hiding-place, [in which she hid her lover].

The husband, from the top of the tree, beholding what was not fit to be seen, exclaimed in extreme rage, ""Ah! thou shameless Russian-born wretch, what abominable action is this?""

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Merchant's Tale,"In the town of Pavia in Lombardy there lived a worthy knight by the name of January. Although throughout his long and prosperous life he had partaken often of the fruits of love, he felt no need for marriage until he passed his sixtieth year, when suddenly he was overcome by a violent urge to become a wedded man. ""A young and beautiful wife,"" he concluded, ""would be the fulfillment of my wealth and glory. Obedient, loyal, and untiring, she would attend to my every need in my waning years, and further, she may well present me with an heir."" ""Not so!"" argued some. ""A wife's interest will be more toward your fortune than toward your well being, and further, her unbridled passions may place your honor at risk."" But January listened not to these negative voices, paying heed instead to those who praised the virtues of womanhood and the benefits of marriage. And thus he soon announced to his friends his resolve to find a bride, ""But,"" he asserted, ""she must be under twenty years of age, for young veal is tastier than old beef."" His friends tried to dissuade him from this resolve, but to no avail, and at last -- driven onward by unrelenting fantasies -- he found the woman who satisfied his dreams. Although not of high rank, she was young and beautiful, and, in his love-blinded perception, she was also compliant and self-disciplined. Further, like old January himself, she too bore the name of a season: May. Marriage documents were executed, the holy sacrament of marriage was duly performed, and the priest united January and May as husband and wife. One wedding guest was particularly moved, a robust young man named Damian, who served as a squire to Knight January. Ravished by May's fresh beauty, the squire fell madly in love with his master's young bride. No one knows what young May was thinking in her heart as old January -- with his beard of stubble and loose skin shaking about his throat -- labored in the field of love. But Damian's thoughts were not entirely secret. He poured out his soul with pen and ink, then managed to slip the letter into the hand of his beloved May without being seen by the ever-watchful January. May's only opportunity to read the letter came in that small place where everyone goes alone. There she committed Damian's message to memory, then tore the letter into pieces and threw them into the privy. But one thing is certain. She took no offense at the young squire's forwardness, for as soon as she could steal a few minutes' time, she composed a letter to the young squire, promising him the satisfaction he desired of her as soon as the time and place might present themselves. In the meantime old January's fortune turned against him, and he lost his sight. The curse of blindness increased the knight's possessiveness and jealousy toward his young wife. Fearing that she might succumb to some temptation under the cover of his darkness, he never let her go out unless he himself had her by the hand. Nevertheless, by using private hand signals and smuggled letters, she communicated her forbidden love to Damian, and invented a plan whereby it might be consummated. The tryst was to take place in a private garden where January and May often walked together. Following his beloved's plan, Damian let himself into the garden at the appointed time, then hid himself in the branches of a pear tree that grew there. A little later January and May, hand in hand, approached the tree, when May suddenly declared an intense appetite for a pear from the nearby tree. ""Do let me climb the tree and pluck a pear,"" she begged of her husband. Then recalling his blind jealousy, she added, ""You can hold your arms around the tree to make sure that I am alone."" Not wanting to deny her this innocent request, he stooped over and let her step onto his back. Taking hold of a branch, she pulled herself into tree and into the arms of the waiting Damian. Now ladies, please take no offence, but I must tell the story as it actually happened. Damian forthwith lifted her smock and thrust away, with the deceived husband blindly hugging the tree beneath them. However, this shameful tryst was not entirely unseen. The king and queen of Fairyland saw all, and the king -- horrified at the cuckoldry -- resolved at once to restore the old knight's sight immediately and thus expose his wife's and his squire's faithlessness. ""Do that!"" replied the fairy king's wife. ""But nothing bad will come to the young woman, for I will give her a bold and quick answer that will excuse her and her lover from all guilt."" And thus it happened. As granted by the fairy king, sight miraculously returned to January's aging eyes. But his rejoicing was short lived, for looking up, the first thing he saw was his wife engaged in an act that polite words cannot describe. ""Strumpet!"" he called out angrily. ""What are you up to?"" Now it was the fairy queen's turn to ply her magic, and -- as promised -- she put a quick response onto the wayward wife's tongue. ""Sir,"" replied May, ""have patience. Don't you see what I have done? I was told that the only cure for your blindness would be for me to struggle with a man upon a tree."" ""Struggle?"" said he. ""It went right in!"" ""Oh no!"" said she. ""You caught a hazy glimpse, my good sir, but your sight is still poor. Things are not as they first appeared to you."" Then she continued, ""This slander is my reward for helping you to see."" ""Never mind!"" said he. ""Come down. But it did appear to me that Damian was enjoying you with your smock upon his breast."" ""Think what you will,"" said she, ""but it was only a false vision following your long blindness."" With that she jumped down from the tree, and January led her happily back home.",Geoffrey Chaucer,"Source: Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales, ""The Merchant's Tale.""

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Story of Lydia and Pyrrhus,"Nicostratus, a wealthy patrician, married Lydia, a woman of great distinction and unsurpassed beauty. He was well advanced in years, while she was still a paragon of youth and vitality. Consequently, to state the matter delicately, their marriage did not leave the young wife entirely satisfied. Thus, it is quite understandable that Lydia found herself paying ever more attention to one of her husband's servants, Pyrrhus by name, who was elegant, handsome, young, and energetic. He was attracted to her as well, and gladly would have accepted her invitations to love, but the old man gave them no opportunity. What he lacked in vigor he made up with jealousy and perseverance, rarely leaving his beautiful young wife alone. Their unrequited passion aglow, Lydia and Pyrrhus devised a daring scheme through which, even in the master's presence, they might satisfy their longing for one another. Accordingly, one day when the three were walking in the garden, as they often did, Lydia requested a pear from a certain tree. Pyrrhus climbed after the fruit, but once in the tree, he called to his master, ""Have you no shame, making love like that in broad daylight?"" The master demanded an explanation for the strange remark, and Pyrrhus concluded that the pear tree was enchanted, giving the impression of unreal happenings below. To test the theory, he asked his master to climb the tree, and see if he too would behold impossible things below. His curiosity piqued, Nicostratus mustered enough strength to climb onto one of the pear tree's lower branches. Looking down, what did he behold but Pyrrhus and Lydia making fervent love. From his precarious perch, he shouted curses, threats, and insults at them. but they -- engaged with other pursuits -- quite ignored him. Nicostratus climbed down from the tree, only to find Pyrrhus and Lydia seated discretely on a garden bench. Their innocent demeanor convinced him that nothing unseemly had happened. Fearing that only a bedeviled tree could be responsible for the vile images that he had perceived, he sent for an ax and had it cut down immediately. From that time forth Nicostratus relaxed his watchful vigil over his young wife, and thus Pyrrhus and Lydia were able to pluck the fruits of their love at regular intervals, even without the help of their enchanted pear tree.",Giovanni Boccaccio,"Source: Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron, day 7, tale 9.

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Story of the Simpleton Husband,"One day of the days, as the woman was closeted with her lover, he said to her, ""O my lady and my beloved, an [if] thou desire me and love me, give me possession of thy person and satisfy my need in the presence of thy husband; otherwise I will never again come to thee nor draw near thee while I live my life."" Now she loved him with exceeding love and c&uld not suffer his separation an hour nor could endure to anger him; so, when she heard his words, she said to him, ""Bismillah, so be it, in Allah's name, O my darling and coolth of mine eyes: may he not live who would vex thee!"" Quoth he, ""Today?"" And quoth she, ""Yes, by thy life,"" and made an appointment with him for this. When her husband came home, she said to him, ""I want to go a-pleasuring,"" and he said, ""With all my heart."" So he went, till he came to a goodly place, abounding in vines and water, whither he carried her and pitched her a tent by the side of a tall tree; and she betook herself to a place alongside the tent and made her there a Sarddb [an underground vault], in which she hid her lover. Then said she to her husband, ""I want to climb this tree""; and he said, ""Do so."" So she clomb it and when she came to the tree-top, she cried out and slapped her face, saying, ""O thou lecher, are these thy lewd ways? Thou swarest faith to me, and thou liedest."" And she repeated her speech twice and thrice. Then she came down from the tree and rent her raiment and said, ""O lecher, an [if] these be thy dealings with me before my eyes, how dost thou when thou art absent from me?"" Quoth he, ""What aileth thee?"" and quoth she, ""I saw thee futter the woman before my very eyes."" Cried he, ""Not so, by Allah! But hold thy peace till I go up and see."" So he clomb the tree and no sooner did he begin to do so than out came the lover from his hiding place and taking the woman by the legs, fell to shagging her. When the husband came to the top of the tree, he looked and beheld a man futtering his wife; so he called out, ""O whore, what doings are these?"" and he made haste to come down from the tree to the ground. But meanwhile the lover had returned to his hiding place and his wife asked him, ""What sawest thou?"" and he answered, ""I saw a man shag thee."" But she said, ""Thou liest; thou sawest naught and sayst this only by way of phantasy."" The same they did three several times, and every time he clomb the tree the lover came up out of the underground place and mounted her, whilst her husband looked on and she still said, ""Seest thou aught, O liar?"" ""Yes,"" would he answer, and came down in haste, but saw no one and she said to him, ""By my life, look and speak naught but sooth!"" Then he cried to her, ""Arise, let us depart this place, for 'tis full of Jinn and Marids."" Accordingly, they returned to their house and nighted there, and the man arose in the morning, assured that this was all but phantasy and fascination. And so the lover won his wicked will.",1001 Nights (translated by Richard Burton),"Source: Richard F.

The Enchanted Pear Tree,1423,The Twenty-Ninth Vizier's Story,"There was in the palace of the world a grocer, and he had a wife, a beauty of the age, and that woman had a lover. One day this woman's lover said, ""If your husband found us out, he would not leave either of us sound."" The woman said, ""I am able to manage that I shall make merry with you before my husband's eyes."" The youth said, ""Such a thing cannot be."" The woman replied, ""In such and such a place there is a large tree. Tomorrow I will go on an outing with my husband to the foot of that tree. Hide yourself in a secret place near that tree, and when I make a sign to you, come."" As her lover left, her husband arrived. The woman said, ""Man, I would like to go on an outing with you tomorrow to such and such a tree."" The man replied, ""So be it."" When it was morning the woman and her husband went to that tree. The woman said, ""They say that he who eats this sweetmeat sees single things as though they were double,"" and she ate some and gave her husband some to eat. Half an hour afterward the woman climbed up the tree and turned and looked down and began, ""May you be struck blind! May God punish you! Man, what are you doing? Is there anyone who has ever done such a thing? You are making merry with a strange woman under the eyes of your wife. Quick, divorce me!"" And she cried out. Her husband said, ""What is with you, woman? Have you gone mad? There is no one with me."" Said the woman, ""Be silent, you unblushing and shameless fellow. The woman is with you, and you deny it."" Her husband said, ""Come down."" She replied, ""I will not come down so long as that woman is with you."" Her husband began to swear, protesting, and the woman came down and said to him, ""Where is that harlot? Quick, show her to me, or else!"" Again the man swore, and the woman said, ""Can it then be the work of the sweetmeat?"" The man said, ""May be."" Said the woman, ""You too go up and look down on me, and let us see."" Her husband took hold of the tree, and while he was climbing, the woman made a sign to her lover. The man looked down and saw the woman making merry with a youth. This time the man cried out, ""Away with you! What is with you, you shameless boy?"" The woman said, ""You are lying."" But the man could not endure it and began to come down, and the youth ran off. .",Turkey,"Source: Sheykh-Zada, The History of the Forty Vezirs; or, The Story of the Forty Morns and Eves, translated by E.

Child Custody,0926,Solomon and the Two Women,"Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto King Solomon, and stood before him. And the one woman said, ""Oh my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.

The two women thereupon ""went to an adjacent agraharam (the Brahmans' quarters in a city or village), and remained there, rearing the boy with great affection, so much so that the child knew not which of the two was his real mother. But one day the younger lady quarrelled with the elder, and, declaring that she would no longer remain with her, took the child and set out to go home. The elder thereupon seized the child and demanded of the other why she was taking him away. The younger replied that as she had borne the child she was going away with him. So the two still disputing went to the Judge and told their story. He reflected a little, called his servants and ordered them to divide the child in twain and to give each a half. The younger lady remained silent, but the elder, being the real mother, was of opinion that so long as the child did but live it was enough; and, not consenting the Judge's proposal, said to him that the child was not her own, and requested him to give it to the other lady.

Child Custody,0926,The Future Buddha as a Wise Judge,"A woman, carrying her child, went to the future Buddha's tank to wash. And having first bathed the child, she put on her upper garment and descended into the water to bathe herself. Then a Yakshini, seeing the child, had a craving to eat it. And taking the form of a woman, she drew near, and asked the mother, ""Friend, this is a very pretty child. Is it one of yours?"" And when she was told it was, she asked if she might nurse it. And this being allowed, she nursed it a little, and then carried it off. But when the mother saw this, she ran after her, and cried out, ""Where are you taking my child to?"" and caught hold of her. The Yakshini boldly said, ""Where did you get the child from? It is mine!"" And so quarreling, they passed the door of the future Buddha's Judgment Hall. He heard the noise, sent for them, inquired into the matter, and asked them whether they would abide by his decision. And they agreed. Then he had a line drawn on the ground; and told the Yakshini to take hold of the child's arms, and the mother to take hold of its legs; and said, ""The child shall be hers who drags him over the line."" But as soon as they pulled at him, the mother, seeing how he suffered, grieved as if her heart would break. And letting him go, she stood there weeping. Then the future Buddha asked the bystanders, ""Whose hearts are tender to babes? Those who have borne children, or those who have not?"" And they answered, ""Oh sire! The hearts of mothers are tender."" Then he said, ""Who, think you, is the mother? She who has the child in her arms, or she who has let go?"" And they answered, ""She who has let go is the mother."" And he said, ""Then do you all think that the other was the thief?"" And they answered, ""Sire! We cannot tell."" And he said, ""Verily, this is a Yakshini, who took the child to eat it."" And he replied, ""Because her eyes winked not, and were red, and she knew no fear, and had no pity, I knew it."" And so saying, he demanded of the thief, ""Who are you?"" And she said, ""Lord! I am a Yakshini."" And he asked, ""Why did you take away this child?"" And she said, ""I thought to eat him, Oh my Lord!"" And he rebuked her, saying, ""Oh foolish woman! For your former sins you have been born a Yakshini, and now do you still sin!"" And he laid a vow upon her to keep the Five Commandments, and let her go.

Child Custody,0926,The Question Regarding the Son,"Immediately after she had gone down to bathe, a Yakinni, observing her son, and wishing to eat him, took the form of a woman, and coming near the child, said to the woman, ""Friend, this child is very pretty. Is he yours?"" On her saying ""Yes,"" the Yakinni asked her, ""Shall I give the child suck?"" And when she replied, ""Very well,"" the Yakinni took up the child, gave it a little milk, and ran away with it. The mother, seeing the woman running away with her child, ran after her, and asking her, ""Where are you taking my child to?"" caught hold of her. The Yakinni then fearlessly replied, ""Where did you get a child from? This one is my own son."" These two were thus quarrelling, and passing by the gate of the ""Hall,"" when the Bosat [future Buddha], hearing the noise of their quarrel, sent for both, and inquired of them what the cause of their dispute was; and recognising the Yakinni from the fact of her not winking, and her eyes being as red as olinda seeds, he inquired, ""Will you abide by my decision?"" and on their agreeing to do so, he caused a line to be drawn on the ground, and the child to be laid exactly in the middle of the line. He then ordered the Yakinni to take hold of the child's two arms, and the mother the two legs, and said, ""Now, both of you pull away, and whosoever pulls the child over the line will be declared the mother."" They accordingly pulled the child, which suffered grievous pain thereby (and cried). The mother, whose heart burst with sorrow, then let go the child and stood weeping. The Bosat then inquired from those who were present, ""Whose heart is tender towards children? Is it that of the mother or of the stranger?"" Many answered, ""Pandit! the heart of a mother is tender."" Having heard this, the Pandit inquired of all, ""What now do you think? Is it the woman who has the child in her arms that is the mother, or the woman who let go the child?"" Everyone said, ""O Pandit! the woman who has let go the child is the mother."" Then the Pandit asked them, ""Do you all know now who it is that has stolen the child?"" And when they replied, ""Pandit! we do not know,"" he said, ""Oh! this woman is a Yakinni, and she has taken the child to eat it."" The people then asked the Pandit, ""How do you know it?"" And he replied, ""Because her eyes are red and never wink, and she neither fears nor loves anybody. It is thus that I found out that she is a Yakinni."" Having thus spoken, the Pandit asked her, ""Who are you?"" She replied, ""I am a Yakiuni."" ""Why did you take away this child?"" ""Lord! to eat him,"" she replied. The Pandit then warning her, said, ""Hear me! you foolish one. Because you committed sin in your last birth, you have been born a Yakinni; nevertheless, you commit sin still! Oh ! how foolish thou art!"" After that, exhorting her, he made her take the ""Pansil,"" [five moral precepts] and sent her away.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,All-Kinds-of-Fur,"Once upon a time there was a king whose wife was the most beautiful woman in the world, with hair of pure gold. Together they had a daughter, and she was as beautiful as her mother, and she had the same golden hair. The queen became ill, and when she felt that she was about to die, she called the king to her side and asked him not to marry anyone following her death, unless she was just as beautiful as she, and unless her hair was just as golden as hers. The king made this promise, and she died. For a long time the king was so grieved that he did not think about a second wife, but finally his councilors advised him to marry again. He sent messengers to all the princesses, but none was as beautiful as the deceased queen, and such golden hair could not be found anywhere in the world. Then one day the king's glance fell on his daughter, and he saw that she looked just like her mother, and that she had the same golden hair. He thought to himself, ""You will never find anyone in the world this beautiful. You will have to marry your daughter."" And in that instant he felt such a strong love for her, that he immediately announced his decision to his councilors. They tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. The princess was horrified at his godless intentions, but because she was clever, she told the king that he should first get her three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as white as the moon, one that glistened like the stars. Further, he was to get her a coat made from a thousand kinds of fur. Every animal in the kingdom would have to give up a piece of its skin for it. The king was so fervent in his desires, that he had his huntsmen capture animals from across the entire kingdom. They were skinned, and a coat was made from their pelts. Thus, it did not take long before he brought the princess everything that she had asked for. The princess said that she would marry him the next day. That night she sought out the presents that she had received from her fiancé: a golden ring, a little golden spinning wheel, and a little golden yarn reel. She put the three dresses into a nutshell, blackened her hands and face with soot, put on the coat of all kinds of fur, and left. She walked the entire night until she came to a great forest. She would be safe there. Because she was tired, she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep. She was still asleep the next day when the king, her fiancé, came to this forest to hunt. His dogs ran up to the tree and sniffed at it. The king sent his huntsmen to see what kind of animal was in the tree. They came back and said that it was a strange animal, the likes of which they had never seen before. It had every kind of fur on its skin, and it was lying there asleep. The king ordered them to capture it and to tie it onto the back of his carriage. As the huntsmen were doing this, they saw that it was a girl. They tied her onto the back of the carriage and rode home with her. ""All-Kinds-of-Fur,"" they said, ""you are good for the kitchen. You can carry water and wood, and clean out the ashes."" Then they gave her a little stall beneath the steps, where the light of day never shone, and said, ""This is where you can live and sleep."" So she had to help the cook in the kitchen. She plucked chickens, tended the fire, gathered vegetables, and did all the dirty work. Because she did very well at all this, the cook was good to her, and in the evening he often invited her in and gave her something to eat from the leftovers. Before the king went to bed, she had to go upstairs and pull off his boots. When she had pulled them off, he always threw them at her head. Poor All-Kinds-of-Fur lived like this for a long time. Oh, you beautiful maiden, what will become of you? Once there was a ball at the castle, and All-Kinds-of-Fur thought that she might see her fiancé once again, so she went to the cook and asked him if he would allow her to go upstairs a little and look in at the splendor from the doorway. ""Go ahead,"" said the cook, ""but do not stay longer than a half hour. You still have to clean out the ashes tonight."" Then All-Kinds-of-Fur took her little oil lamp and went to her stall where she washed off the soot. Her beauty came forth just like blossoms in the springtime. She took off the fur coat, opened up the nut and took out the dress that glistened like the sun. She put it on and went upstairs. Everyone made room for her, and thought that a noble princess had entered the hall. The king immediately invited her to dance, and as he danced with her, he thought how closely this unknown princess resembled his own fiancée. The longer he looked at her, the stronger the resemblance. He was almost certain that this was his fiancée, and at the end of the dance, he was going to ask her. However, when they finished dancing, she bowed, and before the king knew what was happening, she disappeared. He asked the watchmen, but none of them had seen the princess leave the castle. She had run quickly to her stall, taken off the dress, blackened her hands and face, and put on the fur coat once again. Then she went to the kitchen to clean out the ashes, but the cook said, ""Leave them until morning. I want to go upstairs and have a look at the dance. You make some soup for the king, but don't let any hairs fall into it, or there will be nothing more to eat for you."" All-Kinds-of-Fur made some bread soup for the king, then she put the golden ring in it that he had given her. When the ball was over, the king had his bread soup brought to him. It tasted better than any he had ever eaten. When he was finished, he found the ring on the bottom of the bowl. Looking at it carefully, he saw that it was his engagement ring. Astonished, he could not understand how it had gotten there. He summoned the cook, who then became very angry with All-Kinds-of-Fur. ""You must have let a hair fall into the soup,"" he said. ""If you did, there will be blows for you."" However, when the cook went upstairs, the king asked him who had made the soup, because it had been better than usual. The king had to confess that it had been All-Kinds-of-Fur. Then the king had her sent up to him. ""Who are you?"" he asked upon her arrival. ""What are you doing in my castle, and where did you get the ring that was lying in the soup?"" She answered, ""I am only a poor child whose father and mother are dead. I have nothing, and I am good for nothing more than having boots thrown at my head. And I know nothing about the ring."" With that she ran away. Soon there was another ball. All-Kinds-of-Fur again asked the cook to allow her to go upstairs. The cook gave his permission, but only for a half hour, because by then she would have to be back in the kitchen to make the king's bread soup. All-Kinds-of-Fur went to her stall, washed herself clean, and took out the moon-dress. It was purer and brighter than newly fallen snow. When she arrived upstairs the dance had just begun. The king extended his hand to her, and danced with her, and no longer doubted that this was his fiancée, for no one else in the world had such golden hair. However, the princess immediately slipped out when the dance ended, and the king, in spite of his great effort, could not find her. Further, he had not spoken a single word with her. She was All-Kinds-of-Fur once again, with blackened hands and face. She took her place in the kitchen and made bread soup for the king, while the cook went upstairs to have a look. When the soup was ready, she put the golden spinning wheel in it. The king ate the soup, and thought that it was even better this time. When he found the golden spinning wheel, he was even more astonished, because it had been a present from him to his fiancée some time ago. The cook was summoned again, and then All-Kinds-of-Fur, but once again she answered by saying that she knew nothing about it, and that she was there only to have boots thrown at her head. For the third time, the king held a ball. He hoped that his fiancée would come again, and he would not let her escape this time. All-Kinds-of-Fur again asked the cook to allow her to go upstairs, but he scolded her, saying, ""You are a witch. You are always putting things in the soup. And you can cook better than I can."" But because she begged so, and promised to behave herself, he gave her permission to go upstairs for a half hour. She put on the dress of stars. It glistened like stars in the night. She went upstairs and danced with the king, and he thought that he had never seen her more beautiful. While dancing, he slipped a ring onto her finger. He had ordered that it should be a very long dance. He could not bring himself to speak to her, nor could he keep her from escaping. As soon as the dance ended, she jumped into the crowd and disappeared before he could turn around. She ran to her stall. Because she had been gone more than a half hour, she quickly took off her dress, and in her rush she failed to blacken herself entirely. One finger remained white. When she returned to the kitchen, the cook had already left. She quickly made some bread soup and put the golden yarn reel into it. The king found it, just as he had found the ring and the golden spinning wheel, and now he knew for sure that his fiancée was nearby, for no one else could have had these presents. All-Kinds-of-Fur was summoned. Once again she tried to make an excuse and then run away, but as she ran by, the king noticed a white finger on her hand, and he held her fast. He found the ring that he had slipped onto her finger, and then he ripped off her fur coat. Her golden hair flowed out, and he saw that it was his dearly beloved fiancée. The cook received a generous reward. Then they got married and lived happily until they died.","Version of 1812 Germany, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm","Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Allerlei-Rauh,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, 1st ed.

The Princess Who Would Not Marry Her Father (Portugal, Consiglieri Pedroso). Incest, one of our strongest taboos, has, until our own era, largely escaped exposure and discussion on the printed page. Publishers of folktales dealing with incest have gotten around the taboo in various ways. One of the most disingenuous solutions was used in the following passage from a nineteenth-century English ""translation"" of the Grimms' ""All-Kinds-of-Fur"": Now, the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had just such golden hair. One day when she had grown up, her father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother, so he said to his councilors, ""I will marry my daughter to one of you, and she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and when I die her husband shall be king."" But when the Princess heard of her father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him, ""Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars. Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it."" But she thought to herself, ""This will be quite impossible, and I shall not have to marry someone I do not care for."" -- Andrew Lang, The Green Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green and Company.1892), p. 276. Other versions of the story (including later Grimm editions) make it abundantly clear that the fiancé mentioned here is a different king, not her own father. Beginning with the edition of 1819, the Grimms omitted the episode describing how the young king threw his boots at the heroine's head. The Grimms obviously wanted to de-emphasize the abusive nature of the relationship between the two lovers. However, most versions of the tale describe how the ""hero"" belittles, and possibly beats the woman he will later marry. Link to an English translation of the version of 1857: All-Kinds-of-Fur.",NA
"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,All-Kinds-of-Fur,"""How can you take me for a wife,"" said the girl, ""for I am your daughter."" ""That is all the same to me. I want to marry you."" ""That is entirely impossible!"" said the girl. ""Just go to the bishop and listen to what he says. If he says that you are right, then take me in God's name."" So the king went to the bishop and asked, ""If someone has a lamb that he himself has cared for and raised, is it better that he should eat it, or that another person should eat it?"" ""No,"" answered the bishop, ""it is better for the person to eat it who raised it."" Then the king went back to his daughter and said, ""He told me that I may take you."" ""If he really told you that you make take me, then take me in God's name. But first make me two dresses of pure gold, and fill the pockets with ducats. Also make a bed for me, and a shaft that goes ten fathoms deep into the earth."" When the king had done all this, the girl took the dresses, climbed into the bed, then rode in into the shaft, saying, ""Earth, open further."" And the earth opened further, and she rode one until she came out at another place, and there she remained. A prince was hunting there, and he found the girl, wrapped in an animal skin. He approached her and asked, ""Are you a human?"" She answered, ""Yes, I am a human. May I go with you?"" He replied, ""For all I care you may come with me."" He took her with him and let her herd the geese. One day the king gave a feast, and the women began to dance. Then the girl slipped out of her animal skin and went to the ball in her golden dress, and danced. The prince saw her and said to himself,"" Who can that be? When she leaves the ball, I will follow her."" When the ball was over the girl left, and the prince crept after her. She noticed him, and she began to run, and he ran after her. Then the girl took a handful of ducats and threw them to the ground. While the prince was gathering up the gold she slipped away and hid herself in her animal skin. Then the prince said, ""Tomorrow I will give another feast, in order to see who she is."" The next day at the ball the girl came again and danced, and when she left the ball the prince ran after her. While running away she lost a shoe, and while the prince was picking it up she escaped half barefoot, then hid herself again in her animal skin. The prince took the shoe and tried it onto all the girls in order to see whom it fitted, but he could not find the right one. When the servant girls were taking wash water to the king before he ate, the girl split her animal skin a little at her knee so that her gold dress was visible. Then she went to the servant girls and said that she would like to take the water to the king. But they said, ""What? You, a goose girl want to take water to the king?"" ""What is the matter?"" asked the king. ""The goose girl want to bring your water."" ""Then let her do so. Just let her come."" When she knelt down the golden dress shone through the slit. The prince saw this and cried out, ""So you are the one who tormented me so!"" And with that he took her as his wife.",Greece,"Source: J.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Ass'-Skin,"The king said to her, ""Are you like your name?"" and she said, ""Yes."" She stopped there seven years. Her master gave her all the keys, even that of the treasure. One day, when the king and queen were out, Faithful goes to the fountain, and she sees seven robbers coming out of the house. Judge what a state this poor girl was in! She runs straight to the treasury, and sees that more than half the treasure is missing. She did not know what would become of her -- she was all of a tremble. When the king and queen came home she told them what had happened, but they would not believe her, and they put her in prison. She stays there a year. She kept saying that she was not in fault, but they would not believe her. The king condemns her to death, and sends her with four men to the forest to kill her, telling them to bring him her heart. They go off, but these men thought it a pity to kill this young girl, for she was very pretty, and she told them that she was innocent of this robbery; and they say to her, ""If you will not come any more into this land, we will spare your life."" She promises them that she will not be seen again in those parts. The men see an ass, and they tell her that they will carry its heart to the king. The young girl said to them, ""Flay this ass, I pray you; and, in order that no one may know me, I will never take this skin off me."" The men do so, and go off to the king, and the young girl goes to look for some shelter. At nightfall she finds a beautiful house. She asks if they want some one to keep the geese. They tell her, ""Yes, yes, yes."" They put her along with the geese, and tell her that she must go with them every day to such a field. She went out very early in the morning and came back late. It was the king's house, and it was the queen-mother and her son who lived there. After some time there appeared to her one day an old woman, who called to her, ""Faithful, you have done penance enough. The son of the king is going to give some grand feasts, and you must go to them. This evening you will ask madame permission, and you will tell her that you will give her all the news of the ball if she will let you go for a little while. And, see, here is a nut. All the dresses and things you want will come out of that. You will break it as you go to the place of the festival."" That evening she asked permission of her mistress to go and see the festival which the king is going to give, for a short time only, and that she will return directly and tell her all that she has seen there. Her mistress said, ""Yes."" That evening she goes then. On her way she breaks the nut, and there comes out of it a silver robe. She puts it on, and goes there, and immediately she enters all the world looks at her. The king is bewitched, he does not quit her for an instant, and they always dance together. He pays no attention at all to the other young ladies. They enjoy the refreshments very much. Some friends of the king call him, and he has to go there; and in this interval Faithful makes her escape to the house. She tells the queen how that a young girl had come to the ball, how she had dazzled everybody, and especially the king, who paid attention to her alone, but that she had escaped. When the son comes to the house, his mother says to him, ""She escaped from you then, your young lady? She did not care for you, doubtless."" He says to his mother, ""Who told you that?"" ""Ass'-Skin; she wished to go and see it."" The king goes to where Faithful was and gives her two blows with his slipper, saying to her, ""If you return there again I will kill you on the spot."" The next day Ass'-Skin goes with her geese, and there appears to her again the old woman. She tells her that she ought to go to the ball again this evening -- that her mistress would give her permission. ""Here is a walnut; you have there all that is necessary to dress yourself with. The king will ask you your name: Braf-le-mandoufle [Beaten with the slipper]."" In the evening she asks permission of her mistress, but she is astonished (at her asking), and says to her, ""You do not know what the king has said -- that if he catches you he will kill you on the spot?"" ""I am not afraid. He will be sure not to catch me."" ""Go, then."" She goes off, and on the way she breaks the walnut, and there comes out of it a golden robe. She goes in. The king comes with a thousand compliments, and asks her how she had escaped the evening before without saying anything to him, and that he had been very much hurt at it. They amuse themselves thoroughly. The king has eyes for her alone. He asks her her name. She tells him, ""Braf-le-mandoufle."" They feast themselves well, and some friends having called to him he goes to them, and the young lady escapes. Ass'-Skin goes to tell the queen that yesterday evening's young lady had come, but still more beautiful -- that she had escaped in the very middle of the ball. She goes off to her geese. The king comes to his house. His mother says to him, ""She came then, the young lady you love? But she only loves you so-so, since she has gone off in this fashion."" ""Who told you that?"" ""Ass'-Skin."" He goes off to her and gives her two kicks with his slipper, and says to her, ""Woe to you if you go there again; I will kill you on the very spot."" She goes off to her geese, and the old woman comes to her again and tells her to ask permission again for this evening -- that she must go to the dance. She gives her a peach, and tells her that she will have there all that is necessary to dress herself with. She goes then to ask her mistress if she will give her permission, like last night, to go to the ball. She says to her, ""Yes, yes, I will give you leave. But are you not afraid lest the king should catch you? He has said that he will kill you if you go there."" ""I am not afraid, because I am sure that he will not catch me. Yesterday he looked for me again, but he could not catch me."" She goes off then. On the way she opens her peach, and finds there a dress entirely of diamonds, and if she was beautiful before, judge what she is now! She shone like the sun. The king was plunged into joy when he saw her. He was in an ecstasy. He did not wish to dance, but they sat down at their ease on beautiful arm-chairs, and with their refreshments before them they passed such a long time together. The king asked her to give him her promise of marriage. The young lady gives him her word, and the king takes his diamond ring off his finger and gives it to her. His friends call him away to come quickly to see something very rare, and off he goes, leaving his lady. She takes advantage of this opportunity to escape. She tells her mistress all that has passed -- how that this young Lady had come with a dress of diamonds, that all the world was dazzled by her beauty, that they could not even look at her she shone so brightly, that the king did not know where he was for happiness, that they had given each other their promise of marriage, and that the king had given her his diamond ring, but that the best thing of all was that today again she has escaped him. The king comes in at that very instant. His mother says to him, ""She has not, she certainly has not, any wish for you. She has gone off with your diamond ring. Where will you go and look for her? You do not know where she lives. Where will you ask for a young lady who has such a name as 'Braf-le-mandoufle!' She has given you her promise of marriage too; but she does not wish to have you, since she has acted like that."" Our king did not even ask his mother who has told her that. He went straight to bed thoroughly ill, and so Ass'-Skin did not have her two kicks that evening. The queen was in great trouble at seeing her son ill like that. She was continually turning over in her head who this young lady might be. She said to her son, ""Is this young lady our Ass'-Skin ? How else could she have known that you had given your promise to one another, and that you had given her the ring too? She must have been very close to you. Did you see her?"" He says, ""No,"" but remains buried in thought. His mother says, ""She has a very pretty face under her ass'-skin."" And she says that she must send for her, and that he must have a good look at her too ; that he shall have some broth brought up by her. She sends for Ass'-Skin to the kitchen, has the broth made for her son, and Ass'-Skin puts in the middle of the bread the ring which the king had given her. The lady had her well dressed, and she goes to the king. The king, after having seen her, was still doubtful. He drank his broth; but when he puts the bread into his mouth he finds something (hard), and is very much astonished at seeing his ring. He was ill no longer. He goes and runs to his mother to tell her his joy that he has found his lady. He wishes to marry directly, and all the kings of the neighbourhood are invited to the feast; and, while they were dining, everyone had some fine news to relate. They ask the bride, too, if she had not something to tell them. She says, ""Yes,"" but that she cannot tell what she knows that it would not please all at the table. Her husband tells her to speak out boldly; he draws his sword, and says, ""Whosoever shall speak a word shall be run through with this sword."" She then tells how a poor girl was servant at a king's house; how she remained there seven years; that they liked her very much, and treated her with confidence, even to giving her the keys of the treasure. One day, when the king and his wife were out, robbers entered, and stole almost all the treasure. The king would not believe that robbers had come. He puts the young girl in prison for a whole year, and at the end of that time he sends her to execution, telling the executioners to bring her heart to the house. The executioners were better than the king; they believed in her innocence, and, after having killed an ass, they carried its heart to the king; ""and for the proof, it is I who was servant to this king."" The bridegroom says to her, ""Who can this king be? Is it my uncle?"" The lady says, "" I do not know if he is your uncle, but it is that gentleman there."" The bridegroom takes his sword and kills him on the spot, saying to his wife, ""You shall not be afraid of him any more."" They lived very happily. Some time afterwards they had two children, a boy and a girl. When the elder was seven years old he died, telling his father and mother that he was going to heaven to get a place there ready for them. At the end of a week the other child dies too, and she says to them that she, too, is going to heaven, and that she will keep their place ready; that they, too, would quickly go to them. And, as she had said, at the end of a year, at exactly the very same time, both the gentleman and lady died, and they both went to heaven.","Basque, Wentworth Webster","Source: Wentworth Webster, Basque Legends, 2nd edition (London: Griffith and Farran, 1879), pp. 158-65.","All-Kinds-of-Fur, also known as ""Allerleirauh"" (Germany, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, version of 1812).

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,"Broomthrow, Brushthrow, Combthrow","The count's and his daughter's sorrow and grief were endless. After the mother's burial, the father and his child locked themselves in their rooms and were seldom seen. After a month had passed, the count had his daughter brought to his room and said to her, ""Dear child, you know how much I loved your mother. I cannot live without a wife. Therefore I am going out into the world to seek a wife who -- like your blessed mother -- has a golden cross on her forehead. If I do not find such a woman within a year and a day, then I will marry you."" When Adelheid heard these words she was very upset, and she silently withdrew. The next morning Count Rudolf departed, promising to return within a year and a day. When Adelheid was alone she considered whether or not it would be possible for her father to find a woman with such a cross. Then she remembered that her mother had once told her that except for her and Adelheid, no one on the entire earth had such a cross. She decided to go away. She would rather earn her bread with the work of her own hands than to eat the finest tidbits at her father's table as his wife. She entrusted one of her loyal servants with her plan, and they made preparations to depart. She secretly loaded her valuables, her jewelry, her gold, and her clothes into several large carriages. During the night she drove off with them, accompanied by her servant Gotthold and several others who were loyal to her. They came to a large city where she rented a house and moved into it with her servants. Adelheid had often stated that she wanted to earn her bread with the work of her own hands. Therefore Gotthold sought a position for his mistress in the city. He learned that there was an opening for a kitchen maid in the castle of Prince Adolf. Thus he went to the chief cook and asked him if he would be willing to hire his niece, for that is what he called the countess. As he talked further with the chief cook, Gotthold recognized in him a friend whom he had not seen for many years. He told him that his brother had died, leaving a daughter in his care. The chief cook agreed to hire her. The loyal servant happily returned to the countess and remained in the rented house. Adelheid now dyed her face, neck, and hands brown; covered her golden cross and her hair with a large head-scarf; took off her magnificent robes, putting on instead old, dirty, torn clothing; and presented herself to the chief cook. She was given a small room where she could sleep and keep her things. Slowly she grew accustomed to her job, even though she was exhausted by the hard work. Until now she had not yet seen the prince. One day he invited all his friends and acquaintances to a great ball. On the morning of the ball, Adelheid was sweeping the staircase, when the prince, without being seen by her, walked up and tipped over the dust pail, thus dirtying his boots. As she was fleeing he angrily ripped the broom from her hands and threw it at her. That evening as the hall was filling with people, the young countess went to the chief cook and asked him for permission to go to the ball. He replied, ""No, I cannot allow you to do that. What if the prince were to find out!"" Adelheid continued to beg, until he finally said, ""Just go. But don't stay too late, and if you get anything, bring some back for me as well."" Now she went to Gotthold's house, changed her clothes, washed away the color, and ordered up a splendid carriage in which she rode to the prince's. When the guests saw the splendid carriage approaching in the distance they all hurried outside and said, ""A foreign lady! A beautiful lady!"" The prince hurried toward her, lifted her from her carriage, and led her up the stairs. She had to dance with him the entire evening and to sit next to him at the table. After eating, he asked her what her name was and where she came from. ""My name is Adelheid, and I come from Broomthrow,"" replied the countess. At twelve o'clock she left, and with her the majority of guests. Arriving at home she quickly got undressed, colored herself brown, and took three gold pieces which she gave to the chief cook, claiming that she had stood behind a door and had received the gold from an old woman. The next morning the prince looked for Broomthrow on his maps, but he could not find it. He wanted to ask her about her home city once again, but because he did not know where she lived he invited his friends to a second ball. On the morning of the second ball Adelheid was brushing her clothing when the prince, without being seen, came up the stairs. She turned around and dropped the brush, which fell onto the prince's feet. Angrily Adolf picked up the brush and threw it at the embarrassed countess's head. That evening the chief cook once again allowed her to go the ball, and she took advantage of his permission. At the ball Adolf told her that he had not been able to find Broomthrow. ""How could you be looking for Broomthrow?"" she replied. ""I said Brushthrow."" Once again they danced together, and as midnight approached she went home. She brought the chief cook a gold band, claiming that she had received it as a gift. The next morning the prince looked for Brushthrow, but could not find it. He then invited his friends and acquaintances to a third ball, which was to be even more magnificent than the first two. On the eve of the ball, shortly before the festivities were to begin, Adelheid, contrary to custom, was combing her hair in the castle. The prince, displeased because the foreign lady had not arrived yet, walked up the stairs just as the countess dropped her comb. Prince Adolf picked it up and threw it at the kitchen servant's head. She quickly withdrew, changed her clothes, and went to the ball. At the table the prince said that he had not been able to find Brushthrow anywhere. ""I can believe that,"" she said. ""I called the place Combthrow."" He didn't want to believe her, but she argued with him until he finally gave in. Before she left he placed a ring on her finger, without her noticing it. The next morning the prince was not well, and he asked a chief cook to make soup for him. The latter announced this in the kitchen, and Adelheid asked for permission to make the soup. But he said, ""If you put something in the soup that doesn't belong there, then I am the one who will be punished."" She replied, ""I will not put anything wrong in it."" She made the soup, and without being seen, she threw the prince's ring into the soup. The prince poured the soup into a dish and heard something jingle. He felt around and fished out the ring. Amazed, he then asked who had made the soup. ""The kitchen maid"" was the answer. Adolph ordered his servant, ""Bring her here."" She hurriedly put on the dress that she had worn the previous evening, and when the prince saw her, he recognized his dance partner. She now had to tell him her life story, and soon afterward he married her. In the meantime her father had come home, and when he discovered that his daughter had already married, he had to accept his fate.","Austria, Theodor Vernaleken","Source: Theodor Vernaleken, Österreichische Kinder- und Hausmärchen: Treu nach mündlicher Überlieferung (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1864), no. 33, pp. 172-77.",NA,NA
"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Cinder Blower,"Now in another land there lived a prince who had heard of the girl's beauty. Taking the magic wand in her hand and the dresses over her shoulder, she wished herself to the vicinity of the prince's castle. She immediately found herself in the castle garden. Then she wished for herself a chest in an oak tree in the garden, put her dresses in it, put on the crow-skin coat and went to the castle kitchen where she presented herself as a poor boy looking for work. ""I can use you,"" said the cook. ""You can be the cinder blower."" A few days later the prince came to the kitchen with some freshly killed game. She saw him and liked him beyond measure. Soon afterward there was a wedding in a nearby castle, and the prince went to it. Many people went there to look on at the dance. Cinder Blower asked the cook for permission to observe. She ran to the oak tree, put on the silver dress, and wished herself a carriage in which she rode to the castle. The prince saw her and danced with her, but after a few dances she disappeared. Seating herself in her carriage she said, The next evening there was another dance, and Cinder Blower again asked for permission to go. This time she put on the golden dress, then rode there in the carriage. The prince had been looking for her and was very happy when she arrived. While dancing with her he asked her where she lived. ""In Boot-Throw"" was her answer. She remained there one hour, and then disappeared. In vain the prince asked where Boot-Throw was. No one could tell him. Again that night the prince could not close his eyes, and the next day he was in an even worse mood than before. Cinder Blower was asked to brush his coat, but he did not like the way she did it, and finally he threw the brush at her head. The third evening Cinder Blower again asked for permission to look on at the dance, then put on her dress of precious stones. While dancing with her the prince asked her where she lived. ""In Brush-Throw,"" was her answer. ""Whoever you are,"" he said, ""take this ring from me."" She let him put the ring onto her finger. Then she tried to sneak away, but the prince carefully watched her and followed close behind her. She climbed out of her carriage near the oak tree. However, she did not have time to take off her dress, but quickly put on the crow-skin coat over it. The next morning when the cook was preparing the soup, Cinder Blower dropped the ring into it. The prince found it and asked the cook who had been in the kitchen. ""Only Cinder Blower and I,"" he answered. The prince summoned Cinder Blower and said, ""My head itches. Look and see if any vermin are there."" Cinder Blower obeyed, but when she stood before him, he saw the diamond dress glistening forth from beneath the worn-out crow-skin coat. Then he recognized her. ""Now you are mine,"" he said, and he made her his wife and they lived happily together until they died.",Karl Bartsch,"Source: Karl Bartsch, Sagen, Märchen und Gebräuche aus Meklenburg [Mecklenburg] (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1879, vol. 1, pp. 479-481.","Kaiser Heinrich in Sudemer Mountain (Germany, A.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Doralice,"You must know, dear ladies, that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, according to the story I have heard repeated many times by my elders, had to wife a modest and prudent lady of good lineage, and by her he had a daughter who in beauty and grace outshone all the other ladies of Salerno; but it would have been well for Tebaldo if she had never seen the light, for in that case the grave misadventure which befell him would never have happened. His wife, young in years but of mature wisdom, when she lay a-dying besought her husband, whom she loved very dearly, never to take for his wife any woman whose finger would not exactly fit the ring which she herself wore; and the prince, who loved his wife no less than she loved him, swore by his head that he would observe her wish. After the good princess had breathed her last and had been honorably buried, Tebaldo indulged in the thought of wedding again, but he bore well in mind the promise he had made to his wife, and was firmly resolved to keep her saying. However, the report that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, was seeking another mate soon got noised abroad, and came to the ears of many maidens who, in worth and in estate, were no whit his inferiors; but Tebaldo, whose first care was to fulfil the wishes of his wife who was dead, made it a condition that any damsel who might be offered to him in marriage should first try on her finger his wife's ring, to see whether it fitted, and not having found one who fulfilled this condition -- the ring being always found too big for this and too small for that -- he was forced to dismiss them all without further parley. Now it happened one day that the daughter of Tebaldo, whose name was Doralice, sat at table with her father; and she, having espied her mother's ring lying on the board, slipped it on her finger and cried out, ""See my father, how well my mother's ring fits me!"" And the prince, when he saw what she had done, assented. But not long after this the soul of Tebaldo was assailed by a strange and diabolical temptation to take to wife his daughter Doralice, and for many days he lived tossed about between yea and nay. At last, overcome by the strength of this devilish intent, and fired by the beauty of the maiden, he one day called her to him and said, ""Doralice, my daughter, while your mother was yet alive, but fast nearing the end of her days, she besought me never to take to wife any woman whose finger would not fit the ring she herself always wore in her lifetime, and I swore by my head that I would observe this last request of hers. Wherefore, when I felt the time was come for me to wed anew, I made trial of many maidens, but not one could I find who could wear your mother's ring, except yourself. Therefore I have decided to take you for my wife, for thus I shall satisfy my own desire without violating the promise I made to your mother."" Doralice, who was as pure as she was beautiful, when she listened to the evil designs of her wicked father, was deeply troubled in her heart; but, taking heed of his vile and abominable lust, and fearing the effects of his rage, she made no answer and went out of his presence with an untroubled face. As there was no one whom she could trust so well as her old nurse, she repaired to her at once as the surest bulwark of her safety, to take counsel as to what she should do. The nurse, when she had heard the story of the execrable lust of this wicked father, spake words of comfort to Doralice, for she knew well the constancy and steadfast nature of the girl, and that she would be ready to endure any torment rather than accede to her father's desire, and promised to aid her in keeping her virginity unsullied by such terrible disgrace. After this the nurse thought of nothing else than how she might best find a way for Doralice out of this strait, planning now this and now that, but finding no method which gained her entire approval. She would fain have had Doralice take to flight and put long distance betwixt her and her father, but she feared the craft of Tebaldo, and lest the girl should fall into his hands after her flight, feeling certain that in such event he would put her to death. So while the faithful nurse was thus taking counsel with herself, she suddenly hit upon a fresh scheme, which was what I will now tell you. In the chamber of the dead lady there was a fair cassone, or clothes-chest, magnificently carved, in which Doralice kept her richest dresses and her most precious jewels, and this wardrobe the nurse alone could open. So she removed from it by stealth all the robes and the ornaments that were therein, and bestowed them elsewhere, placing in it a good store of a certain liquor which had such great virtue, that whosoever took a spoonful of it, or even less, could live for a long time without further nourishment. Then, having called Doralice, she shut her therein, and bade her remain in hiding until such time as God should send her better fortune, and her father be delivered from the bestial mood which had come upon him. The maiden, obedient to the good old woman's command, did all that was told her; and the father, still set upon his accursed design, and making no effort to restrain his unnatural lust, demanded every day what had become of his daughter; and, neither finding any trace of her, or knowing aught where she could be, his rage became so terrible that he threatened to have her killed as soon as he should find her. Early one morning it chanced that Tebaldo went into the room where the chest was, and as soon as his eye fell upon it, he felt, from the associations connected with it, that he could not any longer endure the sight of it, so he gave orders that it should straightway be taken out and placed elsewhere and sold, so that its presence might not bee an offence to him. The servants were prompt to obey their master's command, and, having taken the thing on their shoulders, they bore it away to the marketplace. It chanced that there was at that time in the city a rich dealer from Genoa, who, as soon as he caught sight of the sumptuously carved cassone, admired it greatly, and settled with himself that he would not let it go from him, however much he might have to pay for it. So, having accosted the servant who was charged with the sale of it, and learnt the price demanded, he bought it forthwith, and gave orders to a porter to carry it away and place it on board his ship. The nurse, who was watching the trafficking from a distance, was well pleased with the issue thereof, though she grieved sore at losing the maiden. Wherefore she consoled herself by reflecting that when it comes to the choice of evils it is ever wiser to avoid the greater. The merchant, having set sail from Salerno with his carven chest and other valuable wares, voyaged to the island of Britain, known to us today as England, and landed at a port near which the country was spread out in a vast plain. Before he had been there long, Genese, who had lately been crowned king of the island, happened to be riding along the seashore, chasing a fine stag, which, in the end, ran down to the beach and took to the water. The king, feeling wary and worn with the long pursuit, was fain to rest awhile, and, having caught sight of the ship, he sent to ask the master of it to give him something to drink; and the latter, feigning to be ignorant he was talking to the king, greeted Genese familiarly, and gave him a hearty welcome, finally prevailing upon him to go on board his vessel. The king, when he saw the beautiful clothes-chest so finely carved, was taken with a great longing to possess it, and grew so impatient to call it his own that every hour seemed like a thousand till he should be able to claim it. He then asked the merchant the price he asked for it, and was answered that the price was a very heavy one. The king, being now more taken than ever with the beautiful handicraft, would not leave the ship till he had arranged a price with the merchant, and, having sent for money enough to pay the price demanded, he took his leave, and straightway ordered the cassone to be borne to the palace and placed in his chamber. Genese, being yet over-young to wive, found his chief pleasure in going every day to the chase. Now that the cassone was transported into his bedroom, with the maiden Doralice hidden inside, she heard, as was only natural, all that went on in the king's chamber, and, in pondering over her past misfortunes, hoped that a happier future was in store for her. And as soon as the king had departed for the chase in the morning, and had left the room clear, Doralice would issue from the clothes-chest, and would deftly put the chamber in order, and sweep it, and make the bed. Then she would adjust the bed curtains, and put on the coverlet cunningly embroidered with fine pearls, and two beautifully ornamented pillows thereto. After this, the fair maiden strewed the bed with roses, violets, and other sweet-smelling flowers, mingled with Cyprian spices which exhaled a subtle odor and soothed the brain to slumber. Day after day Doralice continued to compose the king's chamber in this pleasant fashion, without being seen of anyone, and thereby gave Genese much gratification; for every day when he came back from the chase it seemed to him as if he was greeted by all the perfumes of the East. One day he questioned the queen his mother, and the ladies who were about her, as to which of them had so kindly and graciously adorned his room and decked the bed with roses and violets and sweet scents. They answered, one and all, that they had no part in all this, for every morning, when they went to put the chamber in order, they found the bed strewn with flowers and perfumes. Genese, when he heard this, determined to clear up the mystery, and the next morning gave out that he was going to hunt at a village ten leagues distant. But, in lieu of going forth, he quietly hid himself in the room, keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the door, and waiting to see what might occur. He had not been long on the watch before Doralice, looking more beautiful than the sun, came out of the cassone and began to sweep the room, and to straighten the carpets, and to deck the bed, and diligently to set everything in order, as was her wont. The beautiful maiden had no sooner done her kindly and considerate office, than she made as if she would go back to her hiding place. But the king, who had keenly taken note of everything, suddenly caught her by the hand, and, seeing that she was very fair, and fresh as a lily, asked her who she was; whereupon the trembling girl confessed that she was the daughter of a prince. She declared, however, that she had forgotten what was his name, on account of her long imprisonment in the cassone, and she would say nothing as to the reason why she had been shut therein. The king, after he had heard her story, fell violently in love with her, and, with the full consent of his mother, made her his queen, and had by her two fair children. In the meantime Tebaldo was still mastered by his wicked and treacherous passion, and, as he could find no trace of Doralice, search as he would, he began to believe that she must have been hidden in the coffer which he had caused to be sold, and that, having escaped his power, she might be wandering about from place to place. Therefore, with his rage will burning against her, he set himself to try whether perchance he might not discover her whereabouts. He attired himself as a merchant, and, having gathered together a great store of precious stones and jewels, marvelously wrought in gold, quitted Salerno unknown to anyone, and scoured all the nations and countries round about, finally meeting by hazard the trader who had originally purchased the clothes-chest. Of him he demanded whether he had been satisfied with his bargain, and into whose hands the chest had fallen, and the trader replied that he had sold the cassone to the King of England for double the price he had given for it. Tebaldo, rejoicing at this news, made his way to England, and when he had landed there and journeyed to the capital, he made a show of his jewels and golden ornaments, amongst which were some spindles and distaffs cunningly wrought, crying out the while, ""Spindles and distaffs for sale, ladies."" It chanced that one of the dames of the court, who was looking out of a window, heard this and saw the merchant and his goods; whereupon she ran to the queen and told her there was below a merchant who had for sale the most beautiful golden spindles and distaffs that ever were seen. The queen commanded him to be brought into the palace, and he came up the stairs into her presence, but she did not recognize him in his merchant's guise. Moreover, she was not thinking ever to behold her father again; but Tebaldo recognized his daughter at once. The queen, when she saw how fair was the work of the spindles and distaffs, asked of the merchant what price he put upon them. ""The prince is great,"" he answered, ""but to you I will give one of them for nothing, provided you suffer me to gratify a caprice of mine. This is that I may be permitted to sleep one night in the same room as your children."" The good Doralice, in her pure and simple nature, never suspected the accursed design of the feigned merchant, and, yielding to the persuasion of her attendants, granted his request. But before the merchant was led to the sleeping chamber, certain ladies of the court deemed it wise to offer him a cup of wine well drugged to make him sleep sound, and when night had come and the merchant seemed overcome with fatigue, one of the ladies conducted him into the chamber of the king's children, where there was prepared for him a sumptuous couch. Before she left him the lady said, ""Good man, are you not thirsty?"" ""Indeed I am,"" he replied; whereupon she handed him the drugged wine in a silver cup. But the crafty Tebaldo, while feigning to drink the wine, spilled it over his garments, and then lay down to rest. Now there was in the children's a side door through which it was possible to pass into the queen's apartment. At midnight, when all was still, Tebaldo stole through this, and, going up to the bed beside which the queen had left her clothes, he took away a small dagger, which he had marked the day before hanging from her girdle. Then he returned to the children's room and killed them both with the dagger, which he immediately put back into its scabbard, all bloody as it was. And having opened a window he let himself down by a cord. As soon as the shopmen of the city were astir, he went to a barber's and had his long beard taken off, for fear he might be recognized, and having put on different clothes he walked about the city without apprehension. In the palace the nurses went, as soon as they awakened, to suckle the children; but when they came to the cradles they found them both lying dead. Whereupon they began to scream and to weep bitterly, and to rend their hair and their garments, thus laying bare their breasts. The dreadful tiding came quickly to the ears of the king and queen, and they ran barefooted and in their nightclothes to the spot, and when they saw the dead bodies of the babes they wept bitterly. Soon the report of the murder of the two children was spread throughout the city, and, almost at the same time, it was rumored that there had just arrived a famous astrologer, who, by studying the courses of the various stars, could lay bare the hidden mysteries of the past. When this came to the ears of the king, he caused the astrologer to be summoned forthwith, and, when he was come into the royal presence, demanded whether or not he could tell the name of the murderer of the children. The astrologer replied that he could, and whispering secretly in the king's ear he said, ""Sire, let all the men and women of your court who are wont to wear a dagger at their side be summoned before you, and if amongst these you shall find one whose dagger is befouled with blood in its scabbard, that same will be the murderer of your children."" Wherefore the king at once gave command that all his courtiers should present themselves, and, when they were assembled, he diligently searched with his own hands to see if any one of them might have a bloody dagger at his side, but he could find none. Then he returned to the astrologer -- who was no other than Tebaldo himself -- and told him how his quest had been vain, and that all in the palace, save his mother and the queen, had been searched. To which the astrologer replied, ""Sire, search everywhere and respect no one, and then you will surely find the murderer."" So the king searched first his mother, and then the queen, and when he took the dagger which Doralice wore and drew it from the scabbard, he found it covered with blood. Then the king, convinced by this proof, turned to the queen and said to her, ""O, wicked and inhuman woman, enemy of your own flesh and blood, traitress to your own children! What desperate madness has led you to dye your hands in the blood of these babes? I swear that you shall suffer the full penalty fixed for such a crime."" But though the king in his rage would fain have sent her straightway to a shameful death, his desire for vengeance prompted him to dispose of her so that she might suffer longer and more cruel torment. Wherefore he commanded that she should be stripped and thus naked buried up to her chin in the earth, and that she should be well fed in order that she might linger long and the worms devour her flesh while she still lived. The queen, seasoned to misfortune in the past, and conscious of her innocence, contemplated her terrible doom with calmness and dignity. Tebaldo, when he learned that the queen had been adjudged guilty and condemned to a cruel death, rejoiced greatly, and, as soon as he had taken leave of the king, left England, quite satisfied with his work, and returned secretly to Salerno. Arrived there, he told to the old nurse the whole story of his adventures, and how Doralice had been sentenced to death by her husband. As she listened, the nurse feigned to be as pleased as Tebaldo himself, but in her heart she grieved sorely, overcome by this love which she had always borne towards the princess, and the next morning she took horse early and rode on day and night until she came to England. Immediately she repaired to the palace and went before the king, who was giving public audience in the great hall, and, having thrown herself at his feet, she demanded an interview on a matter which concerned the honor of his crown. The king granted her request, and took her by the hand and bade her rise. Then, when the rest of the company had gone and left them alone, the nurse thus addressed the king, ""Sire, know that Doralice, your wife, is my child. She is not, indeed, the fruit of my womb, but I nourished her at these breasts. She is innocent of the deed which is laid to her charge, and for which she is sentenced to a lingering and cruel death. And you, when you shall have learnt everything, and laid your hand upon the impious murderer, and understood the reason which moved him to slay your children, you will assuredly show her mercy and deliver her from these bitter and cruel torments. And if you find that I speak falsely in this, I offer myself to suffer the same punishment which the wretched Doralice is now enduring."" Then the nurse set forth fully from beginning to end the whole history of Doralice's past life; and the king, when he heard it, doubted not the truth of it, but forthwith gave orders that the queen, who was now more dead than alive, should be taken out of the earth; which was done at once, and Doralice, after careful nursing and ministration by physicians, was restored to health. Next day King Genese stirred up through all his kingdom mighty preparations for war, and gathered together a great army, which he dispatched to Salerno. After a short campaign the city was captured, and Tebaldo, bound hand and foot, taken back to England, where King Genese, wishing to know the whole sum of his guilt, had him put upon the rack, whereupon the wretched man made full confession. The next day he was conducted through the city in a cart drawn by four horses, and then tortured with red-hot pincers like Gano di Magazza, and after his body had been quartered, his flesh was thrown to be eaten of ravenous dogs. And this was the end of the impious wretch Tebaldo. And King Genese and Doralice his queen lived many years happily together, leaving at their death divers children in their place.","Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola","Source: The Facetious Nights of Straparola, vol. 1, translated by W.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Emperor Heinrich in Sudemer Mountain,"After his grief had subsided somewhat, he revealed to his own daughter, who was almost more beautiful than her mother, his sinful desire to marry her. She appropriately resisted him, finally convincing him to first to travel to the courts of all the kings and counts in Europe in search of a spouse more beautiful than she. He traveled far and wide, but finally returned with the news that a more beautiful woman could not be found anywhere. But still she resisted his pleas and his advances. Finally he set the condition that he would desist from his demands if she could create a blanket upon which all of the earths animals could be seen. She went into a small chapel in the upper city and fervently prayed to God, but she found no comfort in her prayers, so finally in despair she called upon the devil to come and help her. He appeared immediately, saying that he would bring the blanket to her, if she could remain awake in the chapel for three days and three nights. She brought her little dog into the chapel with her and spent the time ceaselessly praying. However, during the third night, just as morning was breaking, sleep almost overcame her. At that moment the devil approached, and her little dog, seeing him, pulled at her skirt so vigorously that she jumped up. The devil angrily dropped the blanket, furiously threw the little dog against church wall, and disappeared. She took the blanket to her father, who then was overcome by such powerful pain that he lost all will to live. He bewitched himself into the Sudemer Mountain near Goslar, whose watchtower is visible throughout the region. There he sits until the present day, and will return only when Goslar finds itself in great need, or when the Day of Judgment arrives.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Fair Maria Wood,"There was once a husband and wife who had but one child, a daughter. Now it happened that the wife fell ill and was at the point of death. Before dying she called her husband, and said to him, weeping, ""I am dying; you are still young; if you ever wish to marry again, be mindful to choose a wife whom my wedding ring fits; and if you cannot find a lady whom it fits well, do not marry."" Her husband promised that he would do so. When she was dead he took off her wedding ring and kept it until he desired to marry again. Then he sought for some one to please him. He went from one to another, but the ring fitted no one. He tried so many but in vain. One day he thought of calling his daughter, and trying the ring on her to see whether it fitted her. The daughter said, ""It is useless, dear father; you cannot marry me, because you are my father."" He did not heed her, put the ring on her finger, and saw that it fitted her well, and wanted to marry his daughter nolens volens. She did not oppose him, but consented. The day of the wedding, he asked her what she wanted. She said that she wished four silk dresses, the most beautiful that could be seen. He, who was a gentleman, gratified her wish and took her the four dresses, one handsomer than the other, and all the handsomest that had ever been seen. ""Now, what else do you want?"" said he. ""I want another dress, made of wood, so that I can conceal myself in it."" And at once he had this wooden dress made. She was well pleased. She waited until one day her husband was out of sight, put on the wooden dress, and under it the four silk dresses, and went away to a certain river not far off, and threw herself in it. Instead of sinking and drowning, she floated, for the wooden dress kept her up. The water carried her a long way, when she saw on the bank a gentleman, and began to cry, ""Who wants the fair Maria Wood?"" That gentleman who saw her on the water, and whom she addressed, called her and she came to the bank and saluted him. ""How is it that you are thus dressed in wood, and come floating on the water without drowning?"" She told him that she was a poor girl who had only that dress of wood, and that she wanted to go out to service. ""What can you do?"" ""I can do all that is needed in a house, and if you would only take me for a servant you would be satisfied."" He took her to his house, where his mother was, and told her all that had happened, saying, ""If you, dear mother, will take her as a servant, we can try her."" In short, she took her and was pleased with this woman dressed in wood. It happened that there were balls at that place which the best ladies and gentlemen attended. The gentleman who had the servant dressed in wood prepared to go to the ball, and after he had departed, the servant said to his mother, ""Do me this kindness, mistress: let me go to the ball too, for I have never seen any dancing."" ""What, you wish to go to the ball so badly dressed that they would drive you away as soon as they saw you!"" The servant was silent and when the mistress was in bed, dressed herself in one of her silk dresses and became the most beautiful woman that was ever seen. She went to the ball, and it seemed as if the sun had entered the room; all were dazzled. She sat down near her master, who asked her to dance, and would dance with no one but her. She pleased him so much that he fell in love with her. He asked her who she was and where she came from. She replied that she came from a distance, but told him nothing more. At a certain hour, without anyone perceiving it, she went out and disappeared. She returned home and put on her wooden dress again. In the morning the master returned from the ball, and said to his mother, ""Oh! if you had only seen what a beautiful lady there was at the ball! She appeared like the sun, she was so beautiful and well dressed. She sat down near me, and would not dance with anyone but me."" His mother then said, ""Did you not ask her who she was and where she came from?"" ""She would only tell me that she came from a distance; but I thought I should die; I wish to go again this evening."" The servant heard all this dialogue, but kept silent, pretending that the matter did not concern her. In the evening he prepared himself again for the ball, and the servant said to him, ""Master, yesterday evening I asked your mamma to let me, too, go to the ball, for I have never seen dancing, but she would not; will you have the kindness to let me go this evening?"" ""Be still, you ugly creature, the ball is no place for you!"" ""Do me this favor,"" she said, weeping, ""I will stand out of doors, or under a bench, or in a corner so no one shall see me; but let me go!"" He grew angry then, and took a stick and began to beat the poor servant. She wept and remained silent. After he had gone, she waited until his mother was in bed, and put on a dress finer than the first, and so rich as to astonish, and away to the ball! When she arrived all began to gaze at her, for they had never seen anything more beautiful. All the handsomest young men surrounded her and asked her to dance; but she would have nothing to do with anyone but her master. He again asked her who she was, and she said she would tell him later. They danced and danced, and all at once she disappeared. Her master ran here and there, asked one and another, but no one could tell him where she had gone. He returned home and told his mother all that had passed. She said to him, ""Do you know what you must do? Take this diamond ring, and when she dances with you give it to her; and if she takes it, it is a sign that she loves you."" She gave him the ring. The servant listened, saw everything, and was silent. In the evening the master prepared for the ball and the servant again asked him to take her, and again he beat her. He went to the ball, and after midnight, as before, the beautiful lady returned more beautiful than before, and as usual would dance only with her master. At the right moment he took out the diamond ring, and asked her if she would accept it. She took it and thanked him, and he was happy and satisfied. Afterward he asked her again who she was and where from. She said that she was of that country, and said no more. At the usual hour she stopped dancing and departed. He ran after her, but she went like the wind, and reached home without his finding out where she went. But he ran so in all directions, and was in such suffering, that when he reached home he was obliged to go to bed more dead than alive. Then he fell ill and grew worse every day, so that all said he would die. He did nothing but ask his mother and everyone if they knew anything of that lady, and that he would die if he did not see her. The servant heard everything; and one day, when he was very ill, what did she think of? She waited until her mistress's eye was turned, and dropped the diamond ring in the broth her master was to eat. No one saw her, and his mother took him the broth. He began to eat it, when he felt something hard, saw something shine, and took it out. You can imagine how he looked at it and recognized the diamond ring! They thought he would go mad. He asked his mother if that was the ring and she swore that it was, and all happy, she said that now he would see her again. Meanwhile the servant went to her room, took off her wooden dress, and put on one all of silk, so that she appeared a beauty, and went to the room of the sick man. His mother saw her and began to cry, ""Here she is; here she is!"" She went in and saluted him, smiling, and he was so beside himself that he became well at once. He asked her to tell him her story: who she was, where she came from, how she came, and how she knew that he was ill. She replied, ""I am the woman dressed in wood who was your servant. It is not true that I was a poor girl, but I had that dress to conceal myself in, for underneath it I was the same that I am now. I am a lady; and although you treated me so badly when I asked to go to the ball, I saw that you loved me, and now I have come to save you from death."" You can believe that they stayed to hear her story.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Maria Wood,"But this she said because the shoe was under a spell, and would fit no one whom he could marry. The king, however, caused the shoe to be tried on all manner of women; and when the answer always was that it would fit none of them, he grew quite bewildered and strange in his mind. After some years had passed, his young daughter, having grown up to girl's estate, came to him one day, saying, ""Oh, papa; only think! Mamma's shoe just fits me!"" ""Does it!"" replied the simple king; ""then I must marry you."" ""Oh, that cannot be, papa,"" said the girl, and ran away. But the simple king was so possessed with the idea that he must marry the woman whom his wife's shoe fitted, that he sent for her every day and said the same thing. But the queen had not said that he should marry the woman whom her shoe fitted, but that he should not marry any whom it did not fit. When the princess found that he persevered in his silly caprice, she said at last, ""Papa, if I am to do what you say, you must do some thing for me first."" ""Agreed, my child,"" replied the king; ""you have only to speak."" ""Then, before I marry,"" said the girl, ""I want a lot of things, but I will begin with one at a time. First, I want a dress of the color of a beautiful noontide sky, but all covered with stars like the sky at midnight, and furnished with a parure to suit it."" Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. ""Next,"" said the princess, ""I want a dress of the color of the sea, all covered with golden fishes, with a fitting parure."" Such a dress the king had made, and brought to her. ""Next,"" said the princess, ""I want a dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and with a parure to match."" Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. ""These are all very good,"" said the princess; ""but now you must send for the most cunning artificer in your whole kingdom, and let him make me a figure of an old woman just like life, fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it, just like a real woman."" Such a figure the king had made, and brought it to the princess. ""That is just the sort of figure I wanted,"" said she;"" and now I don't want anything more."" And the simple king went away quite happy. As soon as she was alone, however, the princess packed all the three dresses and many of her other dresses, and all her jewelry and a large sum of money, inside the figure of the old woman, and then she got into it and walked away. No one seeing an old woman walking out of the palace thought she had anything to do with the princess, and thus she got far away without anyone thinking of stopping her. On, on, on, she wandered till she came to the palace of a great king, and just at the time that the king's son was coming in from hunting. ""Have you a place in all this fine palace to take in a poor old body?"" whined the princess inside the figure of the old woman. ""No, no! get out of the way! How dare you come in the way of the prince!"" said the servants, and drove her away. But the prince took compassion on her, and called her to him. ""What's your name, good woman?"" said the prince. ""Maria Wood is my name, your Highness,"" replied the princess. ""And what can you do, since you ask for a place?"" ""Oh, I can do many things. First, I understand all about poultry, and then --"" ""That'll do,"" replied the prince; ""take her, and let her be the hen-wife, and let her have food and lodging, and all she wants."" So they gave her a little hut on the borders of the forest, and set her to tend the poultry. But the prince as he went out hunting often passed by her hut, and when she saw him pass she never failed to come out and salute him, and now and then he would stop his horse and spend a few moments in gossip with her. Before long it was Carnival time; and as the prince came by Maria Wood came out and wished him a ""good Carnival."" The prince stopped his horse and said, his young head full of the pleasure he expected, ""Tomorrow, you know, we have the first day of the feast."" ""To be sure I know it; and how I should like to be there; won't you take me?"" answered Maria Wood. ""You shameless old woman,"" replied the prince, ""to think of your wanting to go to a festino at your time of life!"" and he gave her a cut with his whip. The next day Maria put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky, covered with stars like the sky at midnight, with the parure made to wear with it, and came to the feast. Every lady made place before her dazzling appearance, and the prince alone dared to ask her to dance. With her he danced all the evening, and fairly fell in love with her, nor could he leave her side; and as they sat together, he took the ring off his own finger and put it on to her hand. She appeared equally satisfied with his attentions, and seemed to desire no other partner. Only when he tried to gather from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Whipblow, which set the prince wondering very much, as he had never heard of such a country. At the end of the ball, the prince sent his attendants to watch her that he might learn where she lived, but she disappeared so swiftly it was impossible for them to tell what had become of her. When the prince came by Maria Wood's hut next day, she did not fail to wish him again a ""good Carnival."" ""Tomorrow we have the second festino, you know,"" said the prince. ""Well I know it,"" replied Maria Wood; ""shouldn't I like to go! Won't you take me?"" ""You contemptible old woman to talk in that way!"" exclaimed the prince. ""You ought to know better!"" and he struck her with his boot. Next night Maria put on her dress of the color of the sea, covered all over with gold fishes, and the parure made to wear with it, and went to the feast. The prince recognized her at once, and claimed her for his partner all the evening, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he tried to learn from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Bootkick. The prince could not remember ever to have heard of the Bootkick country, and thought she meant to laugh at him; however, he ordered his attendants to make more haste this night in following her; but what diligence so ever they used she was too swift for them. The next time the prince came by Maria Wood's hut, she did not fail to wish him again a ""good Carnival."" ""Tomorrow we have the last festino!"" exclaimed he, with a touch of sadness, for he remembered it was the last of the happy evenings that he could feel sure of seeing his fair unknown. ""Ah! you must take me. But, what'll you say if I come to it in spite of you?"" answered Maria Wood. ""You incorrigible old woman!"" exclaimed the prince; ""you provoke me so with your nonsense, I really cannot keep my hand off you;"" and he gave her a slap. The next night Maria Wood put on her dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and the parure made to wear with it. The prince constituted her his partner for the evening as before, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he wanted to learn from her whence she was, all she would say was that she came from Slapland. This night the prince told his servants to make more haste in following her, or he would discharge them all. But they answered, ""It is useless to attempt the thing, as no mortal can equal her in swiftness."" After this, the prince fell ill of his disappointment, because he saw no hope of hearing any more of the fair domino with whom he had spent three happy evenings, nor could any doctor find any remedy for his sickness. Then Maria Wood sent him word, saying, ""Though the prince's physicians cannot help him, yet let him but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed."" ""Nonsense! how can a cup of broth, or how can any medicament, help me!"" exclaimed the prince. ""There is no cure for my ailment."" Again Maria Wood sent the same message; but the prince said angrily, ""Tell the silly old thing to hold her tongue; she doesn't know what she's talking about."" But again, the third time, Maria Wood sent to him, saying, ""Let the prince but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed."" By this time the prince was so weary that he did not take the trouble to refuse. The servants finding him so depressed began to fear that he was sinking, and they called to Maria Wood to make her broth, because, though they had little faith in her promise, they knew not what else to try. So Maria Wood made ready the cup of broth she had promised, and they put it down beside the prince. Presently the whole palace was roused; the prince had started up in bed, and was shouting, ""Bring hither Maria Wood! Quick! Bring hither Maria Wood!"" So they ran and fetched Maria Wood, wondering what could have happened to bring about so great a change in the prince. But the truth was, that Maria had put into the cup of broth the ring the prince had put on her finger the first night of the feast, and when he began to take the broth he found the ring with the spoon. When he saw the ring, he knew at once that Maria Wood could tell where to find his fair partner. ""Wait a bit! There's plenty of time!"" said Maria, when the servant came to fetch her in all haste; and she waited to put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky. The prince was beside himself for joy when he saw her, and would have the betrothal celebrated that very day.",Italy,"Source: Rachel Harriette Busk Roman Legends: A Collection of the Fables and Folk-Lore of Rome (Boston: Estes and Lauriat, 1877), pp. 84-90.","All-Kinds-of-Fur (Greece, J.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Morag a Chota Bhain -- Margery White Coats,"The king saw them from a window, and wished to marry her, and she went for advice to her mother's brother. He advised her to promise to marry the king if he would bring her a gown of birds' down, and a gown of the colors of the sky, woven with silver; and when he got that, a gown of the colors of the stars, woven with gold, and glass shoes. When he had got them, she escaped with all her clothes, by the help of her uncle, on a filly, with a magic bridle, she on one side, and her chest of clothes on the other. She rode to a king's palace, hid the chest in a hill under a bush of rushes, turned the filly loose, and went to the palace with nothing on but a white petticoat and a shift. She took service with the cook, and grew dirty and ugly, and slept on a bench by the kitchen fire, and her work was to blow under the great caldron all day long. One day the king's son came home, and was to hold a feast; she went to the queen and asked leave to go, and was refused because she was so dirty. The queen had a basin of water in her hand, and threw it at her, and it broke. She went to the hill, took out the dress of down and silver, and shook her magic bridle; the filly came, and she mounted, and rode to the feast. The king's son took her by the hand, and took her up as high as any there, and set her on his own lap; and when the feast was over, there was no reel that he danced but he gave it to her. He asked her whence she came, and she said, ""From the kingdom of Broken Basins,"" and the prince said that he had never heard of that land, though he had travelled far. She escaped and returned to the cook, and all were talking about the beautiful lady. She asked about her, and was told not to talk about what she did not understand, ""a dirty little wretch like her."" Then the prince had another feast; and she asked leave again, and the queen refused, and threw a candlestick at her, and it broke, and she did as before. She put on another dress and went; the king's son had eight men on each side of the door to catch her. The same scene went on, and she said she came from the country of Candlesticks, and escaped, leaving a glass shoe. Then the king's son fell sick (of course), and would only marry the woman whom the shoe would fit; and all the ladies came and cut off their toes and heels, but in vain. Then he asked if there was none other. Then a small creature put his head in at the door and said, ""If thou didst but know, she whom thou seekest is under the cook."" Then he got the history of the basin and candlestick from his mother. The shoe was tried and fitted, and he was to marry Morag. All were in despair, and abused her; but she went out to her chest, shook the magic bridle, and arrayed herself, and came back on the filly, with a ""powney"" behind with the chest. Then all there that had despised her fell on their knees, and she was married to the prince. ""And I did not get a bit there at the wedding,"" said the girl. The girl and her chest on the same horse may be seen in the Highlands. The girl, in her white coats and short gown, may be seen blowing the fire in highland inns, the queen's likeness might be found; and the feast is a highland ball; the filly and the magic bridle are common in other stories; the incidents of the basin and candlestick have an equivalent in Norse; and I got them from a woman at the Sound of Barra afterwards, in another story. This shows what may be lost by dignified traveling. While the man was enjoying himself in the kitchen, the employer was smoking in solitary dignity, upstairs in his bedroom, writing a journal, and utterly unconscious that the game he pursued was so near.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,Rashen Coatie,"The queen being now wearied with trying all the arts that mischief could devise, to bring Rashen Coatie's beauty to a level with her daughter's; or to raise her daughter's beauty to that of Rashen Coatie's; thought she must have some hidden means of subsistence, as all the stratagems she tried were always attended with want of success. On consulting her henwife, who was a witch, how she should behave in this critical juncture; the witch said she would give her an eye in her neck, by which sight she would be able to discover many things, particularly how Rashen Coatie was fed and maintained without her perceiving it. Accordingly the queen went next day to the castle to discover Rashen Coatie's friends, and discovered how she was fed, owing to an omission of Rashen Coatie's. She found that it was the calf that fed her, which made her long to get it destroyed. The king though loath to deprive his daughter of her only companion, her favourite calf, he was obliged to comply with the queen's imperious demands, in order to suppress the wrangling and strife which were daily taking place among his domestics, particularly by his queen. Rashen Coatie having discovered the queen's intention, mourned over her ravenous appetite, with streaming eyes and bleached cheeks. The calf having the power of speech, requested her not to be alarmed at what was to take place, but to gather together all the bones into one mass, and place them beneath a particular stone, and in a short time they would revive and come to life again. This having been done as commanded, everything came to pass as predicted by the calf; and the malicious queen having partook of the entrails of the calf, lingered and died of a disease hitherto unknown in that part of the country. Her daughter now became of contempt, despised and hooted by everyone. Rashen Coatie's sun now began to shine in meridian splendour; she was gentle and mild, humble to everyone, which gained her the esteem and good will of both great and small. Her beauty having kept pace with her virtue, her father took such a liking to her, as to wish to marry her; but this being quite contrary to her principles of sound morality, she grew melancholy, every day more and more, and lingered out a weary existence, till having met with her calf, she asked it what was best to be done under such pressing difficulties. The calf advised her to ask from her father a gown and petticoat made of the rashes that grew on the bonny burn side, in which she was to be drest. This having been accomplished; she then requested of him to give her a dress composed of all the colours of the birds of the air. This also having been given her; she demanded a new suit of variegated colours, composed of all those appearances that float in the air, and in the earth beneath. Having obtained all these varieties; she had now no excuse but to comply with her father's wishes, which were to accompany him to the altar, where all things were ready for the marriage ceremony. Having thus far complied with his wishes, she went, but on arriving at the place appointed, she started back, exclaiming, that she had forgotten her marriage ring. Her father, to prevent her returning home, said he had one which would answer the purpose perfectly well; but she insisted on having her mother's ring, and must needs return for it, but promised to be back in a few minutes. Again, she had recourse to the advice of her calf, which was to dress herself in her rashen weed, and to leave her father's kingdom with all speed. This was accordingly done, and she wandered far till she came to a hunting lodge, kept by the prince of that country. Here she made free to enter, and go to the prince's bed to rest her wearied limbs, which had undergone much toil and fatigue in the course of a long and laborious travel. When the prince came to his lodge, he was surprised to find a sleeping beauty in his bed, as it was in a sequestered part of his kingdom, where few inhabitants were to be found. She soon made her escape from him, and went to his father's palace, where she asked a place as a menial servant, which was granted, and thereby put into the kitchen to assist the cook in turning the spits which groaned with the weight of the meat that was roasting for their majesties' dinner. Here she continued for some time, doing all the drudgery of the meanest servant. Christmas, however, came on, when great preparations were made for church. Rashen Coatie also wished to appear among the rest, but was denied permission by the master cook. But it so happened that, on the first yule day, when all were gone, and she left alone in the kitchen to attend the meat, she said to the spits, peats, and pots, to do their duty till she returned; which was accordingly done. The words of the charm which she made use of on this occasion were as follows: The term of her secrecy seemed to be now at end; for hurrying home on the last day, she dropped one of her shoes, which were so completely fitted to her feet, that it was supposed it would suit no one else. The prince, on having found the shoe, which was of pure gold, caused to be proclaimed throughout all the regions of his father's kingdom round about, that everyone should have free liberty to try on the shoe, and whomsoever the shoe fitted best, was to be his bride. Many trials were made, but all to no purpose, till the henwife's daughter caused her heels and toes to be pared; by which process she got it forced on her foot. Agreeably to the proclamation, it therefore became the prince to marry her, with which he was to comply, but with a heavy heart. On their way to the marriage seat, a small bird fluttered over their heads, crying as they went:",Scotland,"Source: Ancient Scottish Tales: An Unpublished Collection Made by Peter Buchan, with an introduction by John A.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Beautiful Princess,"The king had a daughter who was just as beautiful as his wife. He traveled far and wide to seek another wife, but found no one as beautiful as his first wife had been. Therefore he decided to marry his own daughter, but she did not want to marry him. She was not able to change his mind, so she told him to buy for her a louse-coat (a coat lined with louse pelts), a silver dress, a diamond ring, and golden shoes. The king had an old kinswoman. The evening before the wedding the princess asked her what she should do. The old woman advised her to pack her things and run away, so that night she left. The next morning the king looked for his girl, but could not find her. He asked everyone, ""Haven't you seen her? Haven't you seen my bride?"" But no one could give him any information. When the princess ran away she came to a river. She boarded a boat, but the ferryman did not want to transport her. He said, ""If you will not promise to give yourself to me, I will drown you here and now."" She refused him, and he threw her overboard, but she jumped to the water's edge. She continued onward, without knowing where she was going. Then she came to some cliffs, and said, ""Oh, dear God, if only there were a room here!"" Then the cliffs did indeed open into a room, and she went inside. Everything there was just what she had wished for. She soon went out, leaving her beautiful clothes in the room, and it turned back into a cliff, just as before. She went to an estate where she found a position as a Cinderella. Her brother was there as well. He too had left their father, and was employed in the estate as a secretary. He had a servant, and whenever he told his servant to bring him water or his boots, Cinderella ran and brought them to him. And every time she did this, he would throw them at her. She asked her mistress for permission to return home now and then. But instead of going home she went back to the cliffs, and whenever she approached them, they again opened up into a room, and then she would put on her beautiful clothes. Then every time a coach would drive up and take her to church. The secretary was also at church, and he saw the beautiful girl. Therefore he went to church the next Sunday, and the girl was there as well. Her mistress had told her that she had to return before the secretary did. However, one day she was late, and she did not have time to take off her beautiful clothes. Instead she put on her everyday clothes over the beautiful ones. The secretary told his servant to have her come and delouse him. She did not want to do this, and said, ""You have never needed me to do that before, and you don't need me to do it now."" But after the servant had called her a second and a third time, she had to go. While she was looking through his hair, he was examining her clothing, coming finally to the coat. Then he raised his head from her knees, ripped the scarf from her head, and immediately recognized her as his sister. Then they left the estate, and no one knows where they went.",Lithuania,"Source: August Schleicher, Litauische Märchen, Sprichworte, Rätsel und Lieder (Weimar: Hermann Böhlau, 1857), pp. 10-12.","Pigskin (Ukraine, Alexander Afanasyev).",NA
"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Emperor's Daughter in the Pig Stall,"The emperor was astonished at this monstrous requirement, but in order to achieve his goal he depleted his treasury, and what was still needed he forcefully took from his subjects. Thus he collected enough wealth to have a diamond dress made than cost ten thousand times what the golden one had cost. The princess was startled when he brought it to her, and asked for one day to think things through. The emperor granted her this, and she discussed the situation with her nurse, who advised her to demand a dress that he certainly would not be able to have made: one made entirely of louse pelts, and trimmed with flea pelts. When the emperor heard the princess's latest wish he became angry, but said nothing. Instead he issued the order to have such a dress made. It took an entire year to collect all the pelts and hides for this dress, and yet another year before they were all sewn together. Then emperor brought the dress to his daughter, and this time the princess -- following the old woman's advice -- let the marriage between herself and her father take place. That evening, after entering the bridal chamber with him, she asked for permission to step outside for a moment. He refused, for he did not trust her and thought that she wanted to escape from him. She gave him a piece of string, tying one end around her own left hand, and told him that if she did not come back in time, he would only have to pull her in. So the hateful father finally agreed, and the princess slipped out the door, where her nurse was standing ready with an old bill goat, and they quickly tied the string around its horns. Then the princess put on all her dresses -- first the one of diamonds, over that the one of gold, then the silver one, and over them all the disgusting one that the emperor had just had made. Then she fled. Meanwhile the emperor waited impatiently, finally pulling gently on the string. Outside the billy goat pulled back. The emperor finally pulled hard, but the billy goat would not be outdone in such a tug-of-war. Finally the emperor, filled with rage, jumped up and went to the door. To his astonishment, instead of his charming daughter he found there a shaggy black billy goat, which rudely attacked him with its horns. The emperor retreated into the bridal chamber, and called for his people, who -- led by the nurse -- came to him. The emperor vented his anger with a storm of curse words. He told of his adventure and ordered that the billy goat be taken away. The nurse began to shriek, ""See here, you tyrannical father, see what you have caused? God has punished you because of your wicked marriage. He has transformed your daughter into this terrible horned monster!"" With these and many other words, the cunning nurse convinced the deceived ruler that the just anger of God had caused this miracle. Filled with shame, he said nothing more about the matter. Meanwhile the princess fled into a great forest, where -- since the season was right -- she lived from berries and nuts that she found in the bushes. Now it happened that the prince of the kingdom to which these woods belonged was hunting there. Evening was approaching when the prince, accompanied by just one servant, pursued a wild boar into a deep thicket. To his great astonishment he saw there an unusual forest creature. Not knowing what to make of it, he aimed an arrow at it. When he saw that it was not moving, he climbed the tree and captured the unknown animal alive. With great clamor the forest creature was led through the city to the palace. There, because of its disgusting fur, it was turned over to the swineherd, who locked it in his worst pig stall, above which was a chicken coop. Thus the unknown forest creature's fur became even filthier. From the scraps that they brought it to eat, it would take only berries and nuts from the forest. Soon afterward there was a glorious festival in the city. The son of a well-known gentleman was getting married. All the beautiful and important people were gathered there: maidens, ladies, and gentlemen, whatever their names. When evening came the princess, pulled off her disgusting garb, revealing the silver dress beneath it, left the pig stall, and went to the wedding. The prince, who was also there, saw her and danced with her; and because he found her so extraordinarily beautiful he gave her a valuable ring, after having spoken with her, and in the end having danced only with her. Morning approached, and the unknown beauty disappeared from the hall without anyone observing where she went. The princess had put her stall garb back on and was peacefully asleep in the pig stall. On the second evening she again appeared at the wedding, this time in her golden dress. The prince, who had been looking for her, was very happy to see her, and did not leave her side, for he wanted to know who this exceptionally wealthy gleaming beauty was. However, although he watched her carefully, trying to prevent her from escaping again, she took advantage of an opportune moment and slipped away. Before anyone noticed her absence she was again hidden beneath her filthy garb in the pig stall. On the third evening the mysterious maiden once again appeared at the wedding. Her glorious diamond dress astonished everyone. The prince thought that a maiden wearing such an incalculably costly dress must be of high nobility, but he was a thousand times more impressed by her personal beauty. He happily conversed with her alone, but to his dismay she would not tell him who she was or where she came from. As morning approached she again slipped away from the hall so cunningly that neither the prince nor anyone else noticed her leave. The wedding was now over, and the prince had no hope of seeing his mysterious beloved again. This made him seriously ill. The princess sat in her pig stall, but not as calmly as earlier, for she too had fallen in love. A few days passed, and the prince, almost dying of longing, did not leave his bed. Then one of his friends came to visit him, and he ordered breakfast for the prince. The strange forest creature appeared to be quiet and well-behaved, so they let it run about freely. On this morning it had gone to the kitchen to warm itself by the fire, for it was cold in the stall. Reluctantly the kitchen maid had allowed this, and the forest creature was cowering next to the stove. When milk was placed on the fire, the forest creature asked who it was for. Learning that it was for the prince, she secretly pulled from her finger the ring that the prince had given her at the wedding, and dropped it into the pot. After warming herself, she crept back to the pig stall, put on her diamond dress, and was once again the most beautiful princess. Meanwhile the prince was eating breakfast with his friend, and he was shocked almost to death to discover at the bottom of the milk pot the ring that he had given to his beloved mysterious stranger. He immediately summoned the kitchen maid who had prepared his breakfast, but she swore that she did not know how the ring came to be in the pot. The prince investigated further: Who else had been in the kitchen. Finally the girl admitted, after resisting for a long time, that the ugly forest creature had been there warming itself by the fire. The prince and his friend immediately went to the stall where the disgusting forest creature was kept. He opened the door and looked inside, then took three steps back in joyful surprise. There sat his beautiful and beloved mysterious stranger, dressed in her glorious gown. She stepped out and said, ""I am the one, my prince!"" Answering his questions as to how she had come to this horrible place, she told him her story, which astonished everyone. Then the prince tenderly took his beloved princess into his arms. Soon thereafter, to the pleasure of the entire court, a magnificent wedding brought this story to a happing end.",Romania,"Source: Arthur and Albert Schott, ""Die Kaiserstochter im Schweinstall,"" Walachische Maehrchen (Stuttgart: J.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Horse's Skin,"Many years had elapsed since his queen died, and he began to feel lonely without a partner in life, and one who could occupy the vacant seat beside him on the throne, so he resolved to visit a certain court where a princess lived, whom he admired, and to make an offer of marriage to her. The princess, who was selfish and only cared for her own comfort, asked the king before accepting his offer, what he intended to do with his daughters, as she did not want them about her in the palace. ""If my daughters,"" replied the king, ""are a hindrance to our union, I can soon dispose of them, and send them where you will never see them or hear of them."" On his return to the palace he said to his daughters, ""Get ready at once to go with me to the Tower of Moncorvo, where I will show you what you have never seen before in your life."" The daughters, full of confidence in their father, and not suspecting any treachery, readily prepared to accompany him, and after travelling many leagues arrived at the celebrated tower. When the king had them safe in the castle, he said to his daughters, ""Remain here, whilst I pay a short visit to a friend and worthy subject, who lives in this neighbourhood. On my return I will take you back to the palace."" The wicked king, who only made up this excuse to blind his daughters to his real intentions, fastened the great gates of the tower as he went out, so that his daughters could not possibly escape. He supplied them with food every day until his marriage day, but after that he never concerned himself about them any more, but left them to their fate. Hours passed, and days came and went, and still no succour arrived, and they began to be in a dreadful state, without a morsel of food or water to refresh them. And so it happened that one day, when they had given up all hopes of being relieved, and were nearly dead from starvation, the eldest of the princesses said to her sisters, ""Why should we all starve? The best thing you two can do is to kill me and feed upon me as long as I afford you sustenance."" She had hardly said these words when she dropped down dead from want. A few days after this sad event the surviving princesses were again short of food, and nothing was left them but to die. Then the second sister, remembering what the first one had so generously done, followed her example, and suggested that her younger sister should kill her for food; and when she had finished uttering the last words of her advice she also dropped down and died. The poor young girl, now left alone in the large dreary castle, felt very disconsolate, and rent the air with her lamentations. But after a while, being of a courageous mind, she thought to herself that weeping was no remedy for her woes, and that she must devise some means of escape from her prison before she became faint again with want. She now set about examining the various rooms of which the castle was composed, and when she reached the top of the watchtower she looked out and saw a ship sailing on the ocean. Overjoyed at the sight, she at once began to make signals, waving her handkerchief in hopes of attracting the notice of someone in the vessel. The sailors were not slow to perceive the signal, and calling up their captain, drew his attention to it. The captain, who was a humane and chivalrous man, directed the ship towards the spot, and effected an entrance by scaling the wall of the fortress. On reaching the watchtower, the captain and the sailors that accompanied him were shocked to see a maiden of such rank and beauty treated worse than a common criminal. They took her up tenderly and lowered her into the vessel, and sailing to a port of safety they landed her, together with a chest in which she had packed some of her own and her sisters' dresses. As she stood on the seashore she glanced around her, and felt the wretchedness of her situation, without a home or friends to whom to apply for shelter. She had not been long immersed in these melancholy thoughts when she perceived an old woman coming towards her, whom she felt sure was a good benevolent person. She approached her and addressed her thus: ""My good woman, do you know of anyone that would give me shelter and a meal for today? I am willing to work for it."" ""If you want employment come and draw water from the well, and help me to carry it to the house I work for; there you will get a meal, and in the evening you can take up your quarters in my little cottage."" ""Tell me first,"" replied the princess, ""what house it is you work for?"" ""Oh! I draw water for our king's palace."" The young maiden consented to help the old woman, but as she could not work in her fine clothes, she had a garment made for her of the skin of a horse, and thus disguised she did not think that anyone would take her for a princess. Every day she went to the well and helped the old woman to draw water and carry the pitchers to the palace; and from the odd garments she wore everyone in the palace called her ""Horse-Skin."" One day as she entered the palace yard, carrying a pitcher of water poised on her head in a light and graceful manner, which showed off her elegant figure, a page, who had often noticed her beauty, and secretly suspected that the girl was not born to do this drudgery, and that there was some mystery about her, accosted her very respectfully, and said: ""Do you know that our good king is going to give balls for three nights running, so that he may choose himself a wife from among the dancers? The prettiest girl is to carry off the prize, and the king, as a mark of his choice, is to give her a ring -- and what a ring that will be! I wish you could manage to go."" ""What have I to do with balls, a poor girl like me? It is all very well for princesses and fine people. I shall turn in at my old woman's tonight, as usual."" When the princess had done her work she went home, and that evening being the first night of the balls at the palace, she dressed herself in her eldest sister's clothes, and went to the ball. When she entered the ballrooms, which were brilliantly lighted up, all eyes were turned upon her, and before the end of the dance she was pronounced by all present as most beautiful. The king was not long in discovering her charms, and caused great jealousy among the ladies by asking her again and again to dance with him, and loading her with delicate and polite attentions. But she slipped out of the palace early, before the king had time to notice her absence. The next day Horse-Skin was again toiling and carrying water to the palace as if nothing had happened. As she entered the palace yard the page again accosted her, and repeated what he had said the day before. ""Have I not told you, man, that all this does not concern me? What is it to me whether the king gives a ball or not? I shall go home to my old lady and spend the evening resting after my hard work."" The princess went to the second ball in her second sister's dress, which set off her beauty even more than the first had done. A number of partners were anxious to dance with her, but they had little chance, for the king mostly danced with her. He treated the princess with the profoundest respect as he gazed on her loveliness, and dared not ask her who she was. But she with her usual discretion left the ballroom at a moment when the king's attention was engaged by other guests; and next morning, as usual, Horse-Skin was at her duties in the palace. The page once again came up to her and said in a beseeching tone: ""Do, Horse-Skin, go to the last ball, which is to take place in the palace tonight, for the king is to give the ring tonight to the fairest lady and the one he admires most! You should have seen what jealousy there was among the ladies that attended the ball last night; they say it is useless for them to go to the ball again, as the king would not so much as look at them, or speak a word to them. All his interest was centred on a lovely and mysterious maiden who attended the last two dances, and who, I assure you, has nearly turned the king's brain with love; you should see her smile, her coral lips, her star-like eyes -- the very image of yours, I declare! -- and the fascinating manner in which she danced -- there -- I only wish I was a prince to marry her!"" The princess's only reply to all this, was: ""Leave me alone; what matters it to me whom the king admires? Tonight I shall be at my old woman's, as usual."" At the last ball the princess wore her own robes, the colour, stuff, and make of which harmonised with her beauty still more than did her sister's garments; and as she mingled among the invited in the state apartments that night, she outshone all the other ladies -- princesses, marchionesses, duchesses, and squires' daughters -- like a brilliant gem of the first water. The king, fairly captivated, danced with her alone, and towards the end of the evening gave her the ring, as the sign of his having chosen her to be his spouse and queen. And though he had set several of his court courtiers to watch and see which way she took when she left the palace, the princess eluded their vigilance, and departed without being noticed even by the sentinels at the palace gate. Next day the king was sorely puzzled and grieved when, on making enquiries, he found that no one in the palace could give him the slightest information about the lady to whom he had given the ring, in token of his admiration and choice. He ordered a search through all the country round, to find out, if possible, who the maiden was; but all was of no avail, for the damsel could not be discovered high or low. At this the king, from grief and disappointment, sickened, and lay in a stupor for days together, until the physicians began to fear he would not live much longer. One day Horse-Skin met his majesty's nurse, and asked her how the king was. The nurse said the king was so ill that he was not expected to live through the day, all through the violent passion his majesty had conceived for the damsel to whom he had given the ring, and of whom no traces could be found. ""And,"" said she, ""unless the cruel girl makes herself known to his majesty soon, we shall lose our beloved king."" The nurse was at the time carrying some broth to give to the king; and Horse-Skin took this opportunity to drop the ring into the basin, without the nurse perceiving her. Great was the king's surprise when he discovered the ring; and the nurse being asked who had put that ring in his broth, replied that she did not know, and that the only person that had come near her, when carrying the basin, was poor Horse-Skin. The king then sent for Horse-Skin, and bade her tell him who had given her the ring which she had dropped into the basin. ""If your majesty will allow me to leave your presence for a few minutes, I will tell you, on my return, who gave the ring to me."" She had not been absent long when she returned to the king dressed in her own rich garments, and adorned as she had appeared at the last ball in the palace. She stood before the king, and said, ""Does your majesty know me now?"" ""Of course I do, you are the same sweet damsel to whom I gave the ring."" ""Very well,"" said the princess, ""I am she who dropped it in the broth, and I am your humble servant, Horse-Skin."" ""Explain yourself, you are still a mystery to me."" Thereupon the princess related the history of her life, which she did amid tears and sobs, as it brought back to her mind all she had suffered since her cruel father had deserted her and her sisters. The king from being sad, was now delighted to have found his lost love, and soon recovered from his illness, and was once more full of health. The king then led her to a magnificently furnished chamber where she was to remain until his marriage with her, as he would not let her return to the old woman's cottage. The happy pair were married amid great rejoicings, and the king and his beautiful bride were heartily welcomed by his subjects, who had mourned his absence from state affairs. They reigned happily for many long years.",Portugal,"Source: Francisco Adolpho Coelho, Tales of Old Lusitania from the Folk-Lore of Portugal, translated by Henriqueta Monteiro (London: Swan, Sonnenschein, and Company, 1888), pp. 51-60.","The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter (Scotland, J.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter,"She went crying where her muime was; and her foster mother said to her, ""What was the matter with her?"" She said, ""that her father was insisting that he would marry her."" Her muime told her to say to him, ""that she would not marry him till he should get her a gown of the swan's down."" He went, and at the end of a day and a year he came, and the gown with him. She went again to take the counsel of her muime. ""Say to him,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him till he gets thee a gown of the moorland canach."" She said this to him. He went, and at the end of a day and year he returned, and a gown of the moorland canach with him. ""Say now to him,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him till he brings thee a gown of silk that will stand on the ground with gold and silver."" At the end of a day and year he returned with the gown. ""Say to him now,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him till he brings thee a golden shoe, and a silver shoe."" He got her a golden shoe and a silver shoe. ""Say to him now,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him unless he brings thee a kist that will lock without and within, and for which it is all the same to be on sea or on land."" When she got the kist, she folded the best of her mother's clothes, and of her own clothes in it. Then she went herself into the kist, and she asked her father to put it out on the sea to try how it would swim. Her father put it out; when it was put out, it was going, and going, till it went out of sight. It went on shore on the other side; and a herd came where it was, intending to break it, in hopes that there were findings in the chest. When he was going to break it she called out, ""Do not so, but say to thy father to come here, and he will get that which will better him for life."" His father came, and he took her with him to his own house. It was with a king that he was herd, and the king's house was near him. ""If I could get,"" said she, ""leave to go to service to this great house yonder."" ""They want none,"" said the herd, ""unless they want one under the hand of the cook."" The herd went to speak for her, and she went as a servant maid under the hand of the cook. When the rest were going to the sermon; and when they asked her if she was going to it, she said, ""that she was not; that she had a little bread to bake, and that she could not go to it."" When they went away, she took herself to the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the down of the swan. She went to the sermon, and she sat opposite the king's son. The king's son took love for her. She went a while before the sermon skailed, she reached the herd's house, she changed her clothes, and she was in before them. When the rest came home, it was talking about the gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were. The next Sunday they said to her, ""Was she going to the sermon?"" and she said, ""that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."" When they went away, she reached the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the moorland canach; and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat opposite to him. She came out before them, and she changed, and she was at the house before them; and when the rest came home, it was talking about the great gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were. The third Sunday, they said to her, ""Was she going to the sermon?"" and she said, ""that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."" When they went away, she reached the herd's house. She put on the gown that would stand on the ground with gold and silver, and the golden shoe and the silver shoe, and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat where he was. A watch was set on the doors this Sunday. She arose, she saw a cranny, and she jumped out at the cranny; but they kept hold of one of the shoes. The king's son said, ""Whomsoever that shoe would fit, she it was that he would marry."" Many were trying the shoe on, and taking off their toes and heels to try if it would fit them; but there were none whom the shoe would fit. There was a little bird in the top of a tree, always saying as everyone was trying on the shoe, ""Beeg beeg ha nan doot a heeg ach don tjay veeg a ha fo laiv a hawchkare."" -- Wee wee, it comes not on thee; but on the wee one under the hand of the cook. When he could get none whom the shoe would fit, the king's son lay down, and his mother went to the kitchen to talk over the matter. ""Won't you let me see the shoe?"" said she. ""I will not do it any harm at all events."" ""Thou! thou ugly dirty thing, that it should fit thee."" She went down, and she told this to her son. ""Is it not known,"" said he, ""that it won't fit her at all events? And can't you give it her to please her?"" As soon as the shoe went on the floor, the shoe jumped on her foot. ""What will you give me,"" said she, "" to let you see the other one?"" She reached the herd's house, and she put on the shoes, and the dress that would stand on the floor with gold and silver. When she returned, there was but to send word for a minister, and she herself and the king's son married.",Scotland,"Source: J. F.

She made arrangements in some manner (details forgotten) to have the golden cow conveyed under pretence of its being a parting gift or token of remembrance to the prince. She got inside it, and went in the cow a long journey by sea. There was a signal prearranged (details forgotten) of three knocks on the cow to show when she could come out safely. But when she had gone a long way the cow was landed (I think the captain of the ship was in the secret, and was to see to her reaching the prince), but people came to see the cow, for it was very curious, amongst them three gentlemen who wanted to be able to say they had touched it, and one poked it with his umbrella (sic), and said, ""I've touched the golden cow,"" and the next poked it with his umbrella, and said, ""I've touched the golden cow,"" and the third poked it with his umbrella, and said, ""I've touched the golden cow.""

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Princess in the Cat-Skins,"""I took you too sudden,"" said he. ""Sleep on it, and you can give me an answer tomorrow."" She was in great trouble all the rest of the day, and when the evening came she went out into the paddock, where a beautiful filly she used to ride was grazing. ""Oh my poor beast! "" said she, ""I'm sure if you knew my trouble you'd pity me."" ""I do know your trouble, and I pity you, and I'll help you too,"" says the filly. ""I'm the fairy that watched over you from the time you were born, and I am here near you since your mother married the second time. Your stepfather is an enchanter, but he'll find me too strong for him. Don't seem shocked when he'll ask your consent tomorrow, but say you must have first a dress of silk and silver thread that will fit into a walnut shell. He'll promise, and will be able to get it made too, but I'll bother his spinner and his weaver long enough before he'll get it wove, and his seamstress after that, before it's sewed."" The princess done as she was bid, and the enchanter was in great joy; but he was kept in great trouble and anger for a full half year before the dress was ready to go on the princess. At last it was fitted, and he asked her was she ready to be his wife. ""I'll tell you tomorrow,"" said she. So she went to consult her filly in the paddock. Well, the next day he put the question to her again, and she said that she couldn't think of marrying anyone till she had another dress of silk and gold thread that would fit in a walnut shell. ""I wish you had mentioned itself and the silver dress together. Both could have been done at the same time. No matter. I'll get it done."" Whatever trouble the spinner and the weaver and the seamstress had with the other dress, they had twice it with this; but at last it was tried on, and fitted like a glove. ""Well now,"" says Fear Dhorrach, ""I hope you're satisfied, and won't put off the wedding again."" ""Oh, you must forgive me,"" said she, ""for my vanity."" She was talking to the filly the evening before. ""I can't do without a dress of silk thread as thick as it can be with diamonds and pearls no larger than the head of a minnikin pin. Three is a lucky number, you know."" ""Well, I wish you had mentioned this at first, and the three could be making together. Now this is the very last thing you'll ask, I expect."" ""Oh, I'll never ask another, you may depend, till I'm married."" She didn't say till we're married. The dress came home at last. Well, the same evening she found on her bed another made from bottom to top of cat-skins, and this she put on. She put her three walnut shells in her pocket, and then stole out to the stable, where she found her filly with a bridle in her mouth, and the nicest side-saddle ever you saw on her back. Away they went, and when the light first appeared in the sky they were a hundred miles away. They stopped at the edge of a wood, and the princess was very glad to rest herself on a bunch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. She wasn't a minute there when she fell asleep; and soundly she did sleep, till she was woke up by the blowing of bugles and the yelping of beagles. She jumped up in a fright. There was no filly near her, but half a hundred spotted hounds were within forty perches of her, yelling out of them like vengeance. I needn't tell you she was frightened. She had hardly power to put one foot past the other, and she'd be soon tore into giblets by the dogs on account of her dress, but a fine young hunter leaped over their heads, and they all fell back when he shook his whip and shouted at them. So he came to the princess, and there she was as wild looking as you please, with her cat-skins hanging round her, and her face and hands and arms as brown as a berry, from a wash she put on herself before she left home. Well that didn't hinder her features from being handsome, and the prince was astonished at her beauty and her color and her dress, when he found she was a stranger, and alone in the world. He got off his horse, and walked side by side with her to his palace, for he was the young king of that country. He sent for his housekeeper when he came to the hall door, and bid her employ the young girl about whatever she was fit for, and then set off to follow the hounds again. Well, there was great tittering in the servants' hall among the maids at her color and her dress, and the ganders of footmen would like to be joking with her, but she made no freedom with one or the other, and when the butler thought to give her a kiss, she gave him a light slap on the jaw that wouldn't kill a fly, but he felt as if a toothache was at him for eight and forty hours. By my word, the other buckeens did not give her an excuse to raise her hand to them. Well, she was so silent and kept herself to herself so much, that she was no favorite, and they gave her nothing better to do than help the scullery maid, and at night she had to put up with a little box of a place under the stairs for a bedroom. The next day, when the prince returned from hunting, he sent word to the housekeeper by the whipper-in to let the new servant bring him up a basin and towel till he'd wash before dinner. ""Oh, ho!"" says the cook, ""there's an honor for Cat-Skin. I'm here for forty years and never was asked to do such a thing; how grand we are! purshuin to all impedent people!"" The princess didn't mind their jibes and their jeers. She took up the things, and the prince delayed her ever so long with remarks and questions, striving to get out of her what rank of life she was born in. As little as she said he guessed her to be a lady. I suppose it is as hard for a lady or gentleman to pass for a vulgarian, as for one of us to act like one of the quality. Well to be sure! all the cold and scornful noses that were in the big kitchen before her; and it was, ""Cat-Skin, will you hand me this? Cat-Skin, will you grease my shoes? Cat-Skin, will you draw a jug of beer for me?"" And she done everything she was asked without a word or a sour look. Next night the prince was at a ball about three miles away, and the princess got leave from the housekeeper to go early to bed. Well, she couldn't get herself to lie down. She was in a fever like; she threw off her outside dress, and she stepped out into the lawn to get a little fresh air. There what did she behold but her dear filly under a tree. She ran over, and threw her arms round her neck, and kissed her face, and began to cry. ""No time for crying!"" says the filly. ""Take out the first walnut shell you got."" She did so, and opened it. ""Hold what's inside over your head,"" said the other, and in a moment the silk and silver dress wrapped her round as if a dozen manty-makers were after spending an hour about it. ""Get on that stump,"" says the filly, ""and jump into the side-saddle."" She did so, and in a few minutes they were at the hall door of the castle where the ball was. There she sprung from her saddle, and walked into the hall. Lights were in the hall and everywhere, and nothing could equal the glitter of the princess's robes and the accoutrements of her steed. It was like the curling of a stream in the sun. You may believe that the quality were taken by surprise, when the princess walked in among them as if they were the lords and ladies in her father's court. The young king came forward as he saw the rest were a little cowed, and bade her good evening and welcome; and they talked whatever way kings and queens and princesses do, and he made her sit on his own seat of honor, and took a stool or a chair near her, and if he wasn't delighted and surprised, her features were so like the scullery maid's, leave it till again. They had a fine supper and a dance, and the prince and she danced, and every minute his love for her was increasing, but at last she said she should go. Every one was sorry, and the prince more than anyone, and he came with her to the hall, and asked might he see her safe home. But she showed him her filly and excused herself. Said he, ""I'll have my brown horse brought, and myself and my servants will attend you."" ""Hand me up on my filly,"" says she, "" first of all,"" and, be the laws, I don't know how princes put princesses on horseback. Maybe one of the servants stoops his back, and the prince goes on one knee, and she steps first on his knee and then on the servant's back, and then sits in the saddle. Anyhow she was safe up, and she took the prince's hand, and bid him good night, and the filly and herself were away like a flash of lightning in the dark night. Well, everything appeared dismal enough when he went back to where a hundred tongues were going hard and fast about the lady in the dazzling dress. Next morning he bid his footman ask the girl in the cat-skin to bring him hot water and a towel for him, to shave. She came in as modest and backward as you please; but whenever the prince got a peep at her face, there were the beautiful eyes and nose and mouth of the lady in the glittering dress, but all as brown as a bit of bogwood. He thought to get a little talk out of her, but dickens a word would come out of her mouth but yes or no. And when he asked her was she of high birth, she turned off the discourse and wouldn't say one thing or the other; and when he asked would she like to put on nice clothes and be about his mother, she refused just as if he asked her to drown herself. So he found he could make nothing of her, and let her go down stairs. There was another great ball in a week's time, and the very same thing took place again. There was the princess, and the dress she had on was of silk and gold thread, and the darlintest little gold crown in the world over her purty curling hair. If the prince was in love before, he was up to his eyes in it this time; but while they were going on with the nicest sweet talk, says she, ""I'm afraid, prince, that you are in the habit of talking lovingly to every girl you meet."" Well, he was very eager to prove he was not. ""Then,"" said she, ""a little bird belied you as I was coming through the wood. He said that you weren't above talking soft even to a young servant girl with her skin as brown as a berry, and her dress no better than cat-skin.'' ""I declare to you, princess,"" said he, ""there is such a girl at home, and if her skin was as white as yours, and her dress the same, no eye could see a bit of differ between you."" ""Oh, thankee, prince!"" says she, ""for the compliment; it's time for me to be going."" Well, he thought to mollify her, but she curled her upper lip and cocked her nose, and wasn't long till she left, the way she did before. While she was getting on her filly, he almost went down on his knees to her to make it up. So at last she smiled, and said, ""If I can make up my mind to forgive you, I'll come to the next ball without invitation."" So she was away, and when they came under the tree in the lawn she took the upper hem of her dress in her fingers and it came off like a glove, and she made her way in at the hack door, and into her crib at the stair-foot. The prince slept little that night, and in the morning he sent his footman to ask the girl in the cat-skins to bring up a needle and thread to sew a button on his shirt sleeve. He watched her fingers, and saw they were small and of a lovely shape; and when one of them touched his wrist, it felt as soft and delicate as silk. All he could say got nothing out of her only, ""It wasn't a nice thing for a prince to speak in that way to a girl of low degree, and he boasting of it after to princesses and great ladies."" Well, how he did begin to deny anything so ungenteel, but the button was sewed, and she skipped away downstairs. The third night came, and she shook the dress of silk and pearls and diamonds over her, and the nicest crown of the same on her head. As grand and beautiful as she was before, she was twice as grand now; and the lords and ladies hardly dared to speak above their breaths, and the prince thought he was in heaven. He asked her at last would she be his queen, and not keep him in misery any longer, and she said she would, if she was sure he wouldn't ask Miss Cat-Skin the same question next day. Oh, how he spoke, and how he promised! He asked leave to see her safe home, but she wouldn't agree. ""But don't be downcast,"" said she. ""You will see me again sooner than you think; and if you know me when you meet me next, we'll part no more."" Just as she was sitting in her saddle, and the prince was holding her hand, he slipped a dawny limber ring of gold on one finger. It was so small and so nice to the touch he thought she wouldn't feel it. ""And now, my princess,"" says he to himself, ""I think I'll know you when I meet you."" Next morning he sent again for the scullery girl, and she came and made a curtchy. ""What does your majesty want me to do?"" said she. ""Only to advise me which of these two suits of clothes would look best on me; I'm going to be married."" ""Ah, how could the likes of me be able to advise you? Is the rich dressed lady, that I heard the footmen talking about, to be your queen?"" ""Yourself is as likely to be my wife as that young lady."" ""Then who is it?"" ""Yourself, I tell you."" "" Myself! How can your majesty joke that way on a poor girl? They say you're promised to the lady of the three rich dresses."" ""I'm promised to no one but yourself. I asked you twice already to be my queen; I ask you now the third time."" ""Yes, and maybe after all, you'll marry the lady of the dresses."" ""You promised you'd have me if I knew you the next time we'd meet. This is the next time. If I don't know you, I know my ring on your fourth finger."" She looked, and there it was sure enough. Maybe she didn't blush. ""Will your majesty step into the next room for a minute,"" said she, ""and leave me by myself?"" He did so, and when she opened the door for him again, there she was with the brown stain off her face and hands, and her dazzling dress of silk and jewels on her. Wasn't he the happy prince, and she the happy princess? And weren't the noisy servants lewd of themselves when they saw poor Cat-Skin in her royal dress saying the words before the priest? They didn't put off their marriage, and there was the fairy now in the appearance of a beautiful woman; and if I was to tell you about the happy life they led, I'd only be tiring you.",Ireland,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, The Fireside Stories of Ireland (Dublin: M'Glashan and Gill, 1870), pp. 81-87).","The Beautiful Princess (Lithuania, August Schleicher).",NA
"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Princess Who Would Not Marry Her Father,"She then ran to the king her father, and said, ""Sire, do you know that a ring which I found on the table fits me as though it had been made expressly for me! . . ."" The king, on hearing this, replied, ""Oh! my daughter, you will have to marry me, because your mother, before she died, expressed a wish that I should marry whoever this ring would fit."" The princess, greatly distressed, shut herself up in a room which had the window looking into the garden, and gave vent to her grief. Soon, however, a little old woman appeared to her, and asked her, ""Why do you weep, royal lady?"" To which the princess replied, ""Well, what else can I do? My father says that I must marry him."" The little old woman then said to her, "" Listen to me, royal lady, go and tell your father that you will only marry him on condition that he buys you a dress of the color of the stars in the heavens."" And after saying this she departed. The princess then went up to the king, who asked her, ""Well, my daughter, are we to be married?"" To which she replied, ""Well, father, I shall marry you when you bring me a dress of the color of the stars in the heavens."" The father, on hearing this, went out and bought her the dress, and gave it to her readymade. The princess again went to her room to cry. The little old woman again appeared to her, and asked her, ""What ails you, royal lady?"" She replied, ""What can ail me! My father has bought me the dress I asked him for, and he wishes to marry me."" The old lady rejoined, ""Never mind, you must now ask him to bring you a dress of the color of the flowers that grow in the fields."" The princess again went to her father and told him that she could only marry him on condition of his bringing her a robe of the color of wild flowers. The king bought the dress and gave it to her made up, and quite ready to be put on. The princess, again in trouble, retired to her chamber to weep. The old lady again appeared and demanded, ""What ails you, royal lady? "" To which the princess replied, ""What can ail me, indeed! My father has bought me the second robe, and is determined to marry me."" The good old lady rejoined, ""Ask your father now for a robe of various colors."" The princess did so, and asked for a robe of various colors, and the king bought her the dress and brought it to her ready to be put on. The princess returned to her chamber to weep over her new trouble, but the little old woman came to her and asked her what troubled her. The princess replied that the king had bought her the third robe she required of him, and was now determined that the marriage should take place. ""And now what shall I do to prevent it? "" inquired the princess. The little old woman replied, ""Royal lady, you must now send for a carpenter and order him to make you a dress of wood; get inside it and go to the palace of the king who lives yonder, who requires a servant to tend the ducks."" The princess did as she was told, had a dress made of wood, put all her jewels, and everything else she would require, inside, and getting inside it herself; and one fine day she ran away. She walked on and on until she arrived at the said palace. She knocked at the door, and told the servants to ask his majesty the king if he required a maid to mind the ducks. He replied that he did ; and he asked her what her name was, and she rejoined that her name was Maria do Pau; and after this the king sent her to tend the ducks, which were in a field next to the palace gardens. The moment the princess reached it she took off everything she had on, and the wooden dress also; she washed herself, as she was travel-stained, and then put on the richest robe she had, which was the one the color of the stars. The king was taking a walk in the garden, and noticed a lovely maiden who was in the field driving the ducks, and heard her repeat When she had finished saying this she killed one of the ducks; then took off her robes, and again got into her wooden dress. At night she went indoors, saying, ""Oh! king, I have killed one of the ducks."" The king asked her, ""Maria do Pau, who was that beautiful maiden so splendidly robed that minded the ducks?"" To this she said, ""Indeed there was no one else there but myself in disguise."" Next day the king again sent Maria do Pau to tend the ducks. And when she was in the field she did the same thing as the day before. She took off her wooden dress, washed and combed herself carefully, put on the robe the color of wild flowers, and went about driving the ducks, saying as before Ducks here, ducks there, The daughter of a king tends the ducks, A thing never seen before! After which she killed another duck. Next day she did as the day before, put on the robe of many colors, and killed another duck. In the evening when she went indoors, the king said to her, ""I do not wish you to take care of the ducks any longer, for every day we find a duck has been killed! Now you shall remain locked up in the house. We are to have a feast which will last three days, but I promise you that you shall not enjoy it, for I shall not allow you to go to it."" To this she said to the king, ""Oh! my liege, do let me go."" But the king replied, ""No, indeed, you shall not go."" On the first day of the feast she again begged of the king to allow her to repair to it, and his majesty replied, ""God, preserve me! What would be the consequences of taking Maria do Pau to the feast!"" The king put on his gala robes and then sent for her to his chamber, asked her what dress she would like to put on, and the princess replied by asking him to give her a pair of boots, which the king threw at her and took his departure for the feast. She then repaired to her chamber and removed from inside the dress made of wool a wand she had, which the little old woman, who was a fairy, had given her, and holding it up she said, ""Oh! divining rod, by the virtue that God gave you, send me here the best royal carriage, which is the very one that took the king to the feast."" The carriage was instantly in sight, and entering it she made her appearance at the feast, in the robe of the color of the stars. The king, who had his eyes continually fixed upon her, went out to the guards and told them not to allow the maiden to pass. But when she wished to get out she threw them a bag of money, and the guards allowed her to pass, but they asked her to what country she belonged, to which she replied that she came from the land of the boot. The king went home, and on arriving found the princess was already in the palace. The king, who wished to find out whether the lovely maiden which he had seen at the feast could possibly be Maria do Pau, went to see if she was safe in her chamber, and afterwards sent for her and said to her, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, do you happen to know where the land of the boot is situated?"" ""Oh! my liege, do not come troubling me with your questions. Is it possible that your majesty does not know where the land of the boot is situated?"" The king replied, ""I do not. A maiden was at the feast. I asked her where she came from, and she said that she came from the land of the boot, but I do not know where that is."" Next day the king again attended the feast, but before leaving he said to Maria do Pau, ''You shall not be allowed to go there."" ""Do allow me for once,"" replied she. The king then asked her to give him the towel, and as she presented him with it he threw it at her, and departed for the feast. The princess repaired to her room, struck the divining rod, and put on the robe, which was the color of the wild flowers. The king who had been charmed with her on the first day of the feast, now admired her all the more, because she appeared more beautiful than ever. He went out to the guards and told them to ask the beautiful maiden when she passed to what country she belonged; and when she went out she informed them that she was from the land of the towel. As soon as the king was told of this he returned to the palace to think over, and try to guess, if possible, where the land of the towel could be situated. And when he arrived at the palace the first thing he did was to ask his maid if she knew where the land of the towel could be found. To his inquiries she replied, ""Well, well! here comes a king who does not know, and cannot tell, where the land of the towel is situated! Neither do I know."" The king now said, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, every time that I have been at the feast I have seen such a pretty maiden. If the one I saw yesterday was beautiful, the one of today is perfectly lovely, and much more charming than the first."" Next day as the king was on the point of going out the princess said to his majesty, ""Oh! my liege, let me go to the feast, that I may see the maiden that is so beautiful!"" The king replied, ""God, preserve me! What would be the result if I were to present you before that maiden?"" After which he asked her to give him his walking stick, and as he was going out he struck her with it. He went to the feast, and when there the princess presented herself before him in the robe of many colors. If on the previous days she appeared most beautiful, on this day of the feast she looked perfectly ravishing, and more interesting than ever. The king fixed his eyes upon her so as not to lose sight of her, as he wished to see her go out, and follow her to where she lived, as it was the last day of the feast. But the king missed seeing her depart after all, and he could find her nowhere. He went to the guards and asked them what she had said, but the guards replied that she had come from the land of the walking stick. The king returned to the palace and inquired of his maid where the land of the walking stick could be found; but she replied, ""Oh! my liege, that I should know where the land of the walking stick is situated. Does not my liege know? Neither do I."" The king again asked her, ""Do you really not know? Today I again saw the same girl who is so beautiful; but I begin to think it cannot be the same one every time, because at one time she says that she comes from the land of the boot, next time that she is from the land of the towel, and lastly she says she is from the land of the walking stick. The princess repaired to her room, washed and combed herself, and dressed herself in the robe she had on on the first day of the feast. The king went to look through the keyhole to find out why she was so long away and remained in her chamber so quiet, and also to see what she was at. He saw a lovely maiden, the same one who had appeared at the feast dressed in the robe the color of the stars in the heavens, sitting down busy with some embroidery. When the princess left her chamber to repair to the dinner table again disguised the king said to her, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, you must embroider a pair of shoes for me."" She replied, ""Do I know how to embroider shoes?"" and she left the parlor to go back to her chamber. Every day she put on one of the dresses she had worn at the feast, and on the last day she robed herself with the one of many colors. The king begged her every day to embroider him a pair of shoes, and she always returned the same answer. He had a key made to open the princess's room, and one day when he saw through the keyhole that she was robed in her best, he suddenly opened the door without her perceiving it and entered the chamber. The princess startled, and very much frightened, tried to run away, but the king said to her, ""Do not be troubled for you shall marry me! But I wish you first to tell me your history, and why it is that you wear a wooden dress."" The princess recounted all the events of her life, and the king married her. The king next sent for the little old woman who had given her the wand, to come and live in the palace, but she refused to live there because she was a fairy.",Portugal,NA,"Consiglieri Pedroso, Portuguese Folk-Tales, translated from the original manuscript by Henriqueta Monteiro (London: Folk Lore Society, 1882), no. 16, pp. 66-72.",NA
"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The She-Bear,"Now it is said that once upon a time there lived a king of Roccaspra, who had a wife who for beauty, grace, and comeliness exceeded all other women. Truly she was the mother of beauty, but this beautiful being, at the full time of her life, fell from the steed of health, and broke the threads of life. But before the candle of life was finally put out, she called her husband, and said, ""I know well, that you have loved me with excessive love, therefore show me a proof of your love and give me a promise that you will never marry, unless you meet one beautiful as I have been; and if you will not so promise, I will leave you a curse, and I will hate you even in the other world."" The king, who loved her above all things, hearing this her last will, began to weep and lament, and for a while could not find a word to say; but after his grief subsided, he replied, ""If I ever think of taking a wife, may the gout seize me, and may I become as gaunt as an asparagus; oh my love, forget it. Do not believe in dreams, nor that I can ever put my affection upon another woman. You will take with you all my joy and desire."" And while he was thus speaking, the poor lady, who was at her last, turned up her eyes and stretched her feet. When the king saw that her soul had taken flight, his eyes became fountains of tears, and he cried with loud cries, buffeted his face, and wept, and wailed, so that all the courtiers ran to his side. He continually called upon the name of that good soul and cursed his fate, which had deprived him of her, and tore his hair, and pulled out his beard, and accused the stars of having sent to him this great misfortune. But he did as others do. A bump on the elbow and the loss of a wife cause much pain, but it does not last. The one pain disappears at one's side, and the other into the grave. Night had not yet come forth to look about the heavens for the bats, when he began to make count on his fingers, saying ""My wife is dead, and I am a widower, and sad hearted without hope of any kind but my only daughter, since she left me. Therefore it will be necessary to find another wife that will bear me a son. But where can I find one? Where can I meet a woman endowed with my wife's beauty, when all other females seem witches in my sight? There is the rub! Where shall I find another like unto her? Where am I to seek her with a bell, if nature formed Nardella (may her soul rest in glory), and then broke the mould? Alas! in what labyrinth am I! What a mistake was the promise I made her! But what? I have not seen the wolf yet, but I am running away already. Let us seek, let us see, and let us understand. Is it possible, that there is no other donkey in the stable except for Nardella? Is it possible that the world will be lost for me? Will there be such a plague that all women will be destroyed and their seed lost?"" And thus saying, he commanded the public crier to proclaim that all the beautiful women in the world should come and undergo the comparison of beauty, that he would take to wife the best looking of all, and make her the queen of his realm. This news spread in all parts of the world, and not one of the women in the whole universe failed to come and try this venture. Not even flayed hags stayed behind, they came by the dozen, because, when the point of beauty is touched, there is none who will yield, there is no sea monster who will give herself up as hideous; each and everyone boasts of uncommon beauty. If a donkey speaks the truth, the mirror is blamed for not reflecting the form as it is naturally; it is the fault of the quicksilver at the back. And now the land was full of women, and the king ordered that they should all stand in file, and he began to walk up and down, like a sultan when he enters his harem, to choose the best Genoa stone to sharpen his damascene blade. He came and went, up and down, like a monkey who is never still, looking and staring at this one and that one. One had a crooked brow, another a long nose, one a large mouth, and another thick lips. This one was too tall and gaunt, that other was short and badly formed, this one was too much dressed, another was too slightly robed. He disliked the Spanish woman because of the hue of her skin; the Neapolitan was not to his taste because of the way in which she walked; the German seemed to him too cold and frozen; the French woman too light of brains; the Venetian a spinning wheel full of flax. At last, for one reason or another, he sent them all about their business with one hand in front and another behind. Seeing so many beautiful heads of celery turned to hard roots and having resolved to marry nevertheless, he turned to his own daughter, saying, ""What am I seeking about these Marys of Ravenna, if my daughter Preziosa is made from the same mould as her mother? I have this beautiful face at home, and yet I should go to the end of the world seeking it?"" Thus he explained to his daughter his desire, and was severely reproved and censured by her, as Heaven knows. The king was angry at her rejection, and said to her, ""Be quiet and hold your tongue. Make up your mind to tie the matrimonial knot with me this very evening; otherwise when I finish with you there will be nothing left but your ears."" Preziosa, hearing this threat, retired to her room, and wept and lamented her evil fate. And while she lay there in this plight, an old woman, who used to bring her cosmetics, came to her, and finding her in such a plight, looking like one more ready for the other world than for this one, enquired the cause of her distress. When the old woman learned what had happened, she said, ""Be of good cheer, my daughter, and despair not, for every evil has a remedy. Death alone has no cure. Now listen to me: When your father comes to you this evening -- donkey that he is, wanting to act the stallion -- put this piece of wood into your mouth, and you will at once become a she-bear. Then you can make your escape, for he will be afraid of you and let you go. Go straight to the forest, for it was written in the book of fate, the day that you were born, that there you should meet your fortune. When you want to turn back into a woman as you are and will ever be, take the bit of wood out of your mouth, and you will return to your pristine form."" Preziosa embraced and thanked the old woman, told the servants to give her an apron full of flour and some slices of ham, and sent her away. When the sun began to change her quarters like a bankrupt strumpet, the king sent for his minister, and had him issue invitations to all the lords and grandees to come to the marriage feast. They all crowded in. After spending five or six hours in high revelry and unrestrained eating, the king made his way to the bed chamber, and called to the bride to come and fulfil his desire. But she put the bit of wood into her mouth, and instantly took the shape of a fierce she-bear, and stood thus before him. He, frightened at the sudden change, rolled himself up in the bedding, and did not put forth a finger or an eye until morning. Meanwhile Preziosa made her way toward the forest, where the shadows met concocting together how they could annoy the sun. There she lay in good fellowship and at one with the other animals. When the day dawned, it happened by chance that the son of the King of Acquacorrente should come to that forest. He sighted the she-bear and was greatly frightened, but the beast came forward, and wagging her tail, walked around him, and put her head under his hand for him to caress her. He took heart at this strange sight, smoothed its head as he would have done to a dog, and said to it, ""Lie down, down, quiet, quiet, there there, good beast."" Seeing that the beast was very tame, he took her home with him, commanding his servants to put her in the garden by the side of the royal palace, and there to attend to and feed her well, and treat her as they would his own person, and to take her to a particular spot so that he might see her from the windows of his palace whenever he had a mind to. Now it so happened that one day all his people were away on some errand, and the prince being left alone, thought about the bear, and looked out of the window to see her. However, at that very moment Preziosa, believing she was utterly alone, had taken the bit of wood from her mouth, and stood combing her golden hair. The prince was amazed at this woman of great beauty, and he descended the stairs and ran to the garden. But Preziosa, perceiving the ambush, at once put the bit of wood into her mouth, and became a she-bear once more. The prince looked about, but could not see what he had sighted from above, and not finding what he came to seek, remained very disappointed, and was melancholy and sad hearted, and in a few days became grievously ill. He kept repeating, ""Oh my bear, oh my bear."" His mother, hearing this continual cry, imagined that perhaps the bear had bit him or done him some evil, and therefore ordered the servants to kill her. But all the servants loved the beast because it was so very tame, even the stones in the roadway could not help liking her, so they had compassion and could not think of killing her. Therefore they led her to the forest, and returning to the queen, told her that she was dead. When this deed came to the prince's ears, he acted as a madman, and leaving his bed, ill as he was, was about to make mincemeat of the servants. They told him the truth of the affair. He mounted his steed and searched backward and forward until at length he came to a cave and found the bear. He carried her home with him and put her in a chamber, saying, ""Oh you beautiful morsel fit for kings, why do you hide your passing beauty in a bear's hide? Oh light of love, why are you closed in such an hairy lantern? Why have you acted this way toward me, is it so that you may see me die a slow death? I am dying of despair, charmed by your beautiful form, and you can see the witness of my words in my failing health and sickening form. I am become skin and bone, and the fever burns my very marrow, and consumes me with heart-sore pain. Therefore lift the veil from that stinking hide, and let me behold once more your grace and beauty; lift up the leaves from this basket's mouth, and let me take a view of the splendid fruit within; lift the tapestry, and allow my eyes to feast upon the luxury of your charms. Who has enclosed in a dreary prison such a glorious work? Who has enclosed in a leather casket such a priceless treasure? Let me behold your passing grace, and take in payment all my desires. Oh my love, only this bear's grease can cure the nervous disease of which I suffer."" But perceiving that his words had no effect, and that all was time lost, he took to his bed, and his illness increased daily, until the doctors feared for his life. The queen, his mother, who had no other love in the world, sat at his bedside, and said to him, ""Oh my son, where does your heartsickness come from? What is the cause of all this sadness? You are young, you are rich, you are beloved, you are great. What do you want, my son? Speak, for only a shameful beggar carries an empty pocket. If you desire to take a wife, choose, and I will command; take, and I will pay. Can you not see that your sickness is my sickness and that your pulse beats in unison with my heart? If you burn with fever in your blood, I burn with fever on the brain. I have no other support for my old age but you. Therefore, my son, be cheerful, and cheer my heart, and do not darken this realm, and raze to the ground this house, and bereave your mother."" The prince, hearing these words, said, ""Nothing can cheer me, if I may not see the bear; therefore, if you desire to see me in good health again, let her stay in this room, and I do not wish that any other serve me, and make my bed, and cook my meals, if it be not herself, and if what I desire be done, I am sure that I shall be well in a few days."" To the queen it seemed folly for her son to ask that a bear should act as cook and housemaid. She believed that the prince must be delirious; nevertheless, to please his fancy, she went for the bear, and when the beast came to the prince's bedside she lifted her paw and felt the invalid's pulse. The queen smiled at the sight, thinking that by and by the bear would scratch the prince's nose. But the prince spoke to the bear, and said, ""Oh mischievous mine, will you not cook for me, and feed me, and serve me?"" And the bear nodded yes with her head, showing that she would accept the charge. Then the queen sent for some chickens, and had a fire lit in the fireplace in the same chamber, and had a kettle with boiling water put on the fire. The bear took hold of a chicken, scalded it, dexterously plucked off its feathers, cleaned it, put half of it on the spit, and stewed the other half. When it was ready, the prince, who could not before eat even sugar, ate it all and licked his fingers. When he had ended his meal, the bear brought him some drink, and handed it so gracefully that the queen kissed her on the head. After this the prince arose, and went to the salon to receive the doctors, and to be directed by their judgment. The bear at once made the bed, ran to the garden and gathered a handful of roses and orange blossoms, which she scattered upon the bed. She fulfilled her various duties so well that the queen said to herself, ""This bear is worth a treasure, and my son is quite right in being fond of the beast."" When the prince returned to his chambers, and saw how well the bear had fulfilled her duties, it was like adding fuel to the fire. If he had been consumed himself in a slow fire before, he was now burning with intense heat. He said to the queen ""Oh my lady mother, if I cannot give a kiss to this bear, I shall give up the ghost."" The queen, seeing her son nearly fainting, said to the bear, ""Kiss him, kiss him, oh my beautiful bear, do not leave my poor son to die in despair."" Then the bear obediently neared the prince, who took her cheeks between his fingers, could not stop kissing her on the lips. While thus engaged, I do not know how it happened, the bit of wood fell from Preziosa's mouth, and she remained in the prince's embrace, the most beautiful and ravishing being in the world. He strained her to his bosom with tightly clasped arms, and said, ""You are caught at last, and you shall not escape so easily without a reason."" Preziosa, reddening with the lovely tint of modesty and of shame, the most beautiful of natural beauties, answered, ""I am in your hands. I surrender my honor to your loyalty. Do with me what you will."" The queen asked who this charming woman was, and what had caused her to live such a wild life. She related to them all her misfortunes, and the queen praised her as a good and honored child, and said to her son that she was well satisfied that he should marry the princess.

"The
Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter",0510b,The Story of Catskin,"Note by D. L. Ashliman: The conflict between father and daughter in most folktales of type 510B derives from the mother's death and the father's subsequent attempts to marry his own daughter, as evidenced in the previous tales at this site. In some versions, however, the incest motif is suppressed, and the conflict between father and daughter is given a different motivation. The following tale, told here in verse, illustrates this minority group. The heroine here is not at risk because of her father's incestuous desires, but for an inclination much less governed by taboo: his displeasure over the birth of a female child. Note also that the abusive relationship between the heroine and the man she will ulitmately marry has also been altered in this version. She receives the same blows, but from the hands of her female employer, not her future husband. And now, an English version of Catskin: His lady's again in the way, So she said to her husband with joy, ""I hope some or other fine day, To present you, my dear, with a boy."" The gentleman answered gruff, ""If't should turn out a maid or a mouse, For of both we have more than enough, She shan't stay to live in my house."" The lady, at this declaration, Almost fainted away with pain; But what was her sad consternation, When a sweet little girl came again. She sent her away to be nurs'd, Without seeing her gruff papa; And when she was old enough, To a school she was packed away. Fifteen summers are fled, Now she left good Mrs. Jervis; To see home she was forbid, She determined to go and seek service. Her dresses so grand and so gay, She carefully rolled in a knob; Which she hid in a forest away, And put on a catskin robe. She knock'd at a castle gate, And pray'd for charity; They sent her some meat on a plate, And kept her a scullion to be. My lady look'd long in her face, And prais'd her great beauty; I'm sorry I've no better place, And you must our scullion be. So Catskin was under the cook, A very sad life she led, For often a ladle she took, And broke poor Catskin's head. There is now a grand ball to be, When ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook,"" said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" A basin of water she took, And dash'd in poor Catskin's face; But briskly her ears she shook, And went in her hiding place. She washed every stain from her skin, In some crystal waterfall; Then put on a beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. When she entered, the ladies were mute, Overcome by her figure and face; But the lord, her young master, at once Fell in love with her beauty and grace; He pray'd her his partner to be, She said, ""Yes!"" with a sweet smiling glance; All night with no other lady But Catskin, our young lord would dance. ""Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"" For now was the sad parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Basin of Water I dwell. Then she flew from the ballroom, and put On her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. The young lord, the very next day, To his mother his passion betrayed; He declared he never would rest, Till he'd found out this beautiful maid. There's another grand ball to be, Where ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook,"" said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" In a rage the ladle she took, And broke poor Catkin's head; But off she went shaking her ears, And swift to her forest she fled. She washed every blood stain off In some crystal waterfall; Put on a more beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said ""Yes!"" with her first smiling glance; And again, all the night, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin did dance. ""Pray tell me,"" said he, ""where you live?"" For now 'twas the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Ladle I dwell. Then she flew from the ball, and put on Her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. My lord did again, the next day, Declare to his mother his mind, That he never more happy should be, Unless he his charmer should find. Now another grand ball is to be, Where ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook"", said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You impudent, dirty slut! Among the find ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" In a fury she took the skimmer, And broke poor Catskin's head; But heart-whole and lively as ever, Away to her forest she fled. She washed the stains of blood In some crystal waterfall; Then put on her most beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said ""Yes!"" with her first smiling glance; And all the night long, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin would dance. ""Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"" For now was the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Skimmer I dwell. Then she flew from the hall, and threw on Her catskin cloak again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. But not by my lord unseen, For this time he followed too fast; And, hid in the forest green, Saw the strange things that past. Next day he took to his bed, And sent for the doctor to come; And begg'd him no other than Catskin, Might come into his room. He told him how dearly he lov'd her, Not to have her his heart would break; Then the doctor kindly promised To the proud old lady to speak. There's a struggle of pride and love, For she fear'd her son would die; But pride at the last did yield, And love had the mastery. Then my lord got quickly well, When he was his charmer to wed; And Catskin, before a twelvemonth, Of a young lord was brought to bed. To a wayfaring woman and child, Lady Catskin one day sent an alms; The nurse did the errand, and carried The sweet little lord in her arms. The child gave the alms to the child, This was seen by the old lady mother; ""Only see,"" said that wicked old woman, ""How the beggars' brats take to each other!"" This throw went to Catskin's heart, She flung herself down on her knees, And pray'd her young master and lord To seek out her parents would please. They sent out in my lord's own coach; They traveled, but naught befell Till they reach'd the town hard by Where Catskin's father did dwell. They put up at the head inn, Where Catskin was left alone; But my lord went to try if her father His natural child would own. When folks are away, in short time What great alterations appear; For the cold touch of death had all chill'd The hearts of her sisters dear. Her father repented too late, And the loss of his youngest bemoan'd; In his old and childless state, He his pride and cruelty own'd. The old gentleman sat by the fire, And hardly looked up at my lord; He had no hope of comfort A stranger could afford. But my lord drew a chair close by, And said, in a feeling tone, ""Have you not, sir, a daughter, I pray, You never would see or own?"" The old man alarm'd, cried aloud, ""A hardened sinner am I! I would give all my worldly goods, To see her before I die."" Then my lord brought his wife and child To their home and parent's face, Who fell down and thanks returned To God, for his mercy and grace. The bells, ringing up in the tower, Are sending a sound to the heart; There's a charm in the old church bells, Which nothing in life can impart!","England, James Orchard Halliwell","Source: James Orchard Halliwell, The Nursery Rhymes of England (London: F.

Clothes Make the Man,1558,"Eat, My Clothes!","As Giufà was half a simpleton no one showed him any kindness, such as to invite him to his house or give him anything to eat. Once Giufà went to a farmhouse for something, and the farmers, when they saw him looking so ragged and poor, came near setting the dogs on him, and made him leave in a hurry. When his mother heard it she procured for him a fine coat, a pair of breeches, and a velvet vest. Giufà dressed up like an overseer, went to the same farmhouse, and then you should see what great ceremonies they made! They invited him to dine with them. While at the table all were very attentive to him.

Clothes Make the Man,1558,The Brahman's Clothes,"There was once a Brahman who had two wives. Like many Brahmans he lived by begging and was very clever at wheedling money out of people. One day the fancy took him to go to the marketplace dressed only in a small loincloth such as the poorest laborers wear and see how people treated him. So he set out, but on the road and in the marketplace and in the village no one salaamed to him or made way for him, and when he begged no one gave him alms. He soon got tired of this and hastened home and, putting on his best pagri [turban] and coat and dhoti [waistcloth], went back to the marketplace. This time everyone who met him on the road salaamed low to him and made way for him, and every shopkeeper to whom he went gave him alms; and the people in the village who had refused before gladly made offerings to him. The Brahman went home smiling to himself and took off his clothes and put them in a heap and prostrated himself before them three or four times, saying each time, ""O source of wealth! O source of wealth! It is clothes that are honored in this world and nothing else.""",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas, (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 146, pp. 372-73.",NA,NA
A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,A Ghost Story,"The next time the little boy visited Uncle Remus he persuaded Tildy to go with him. Daddy Jack was in his usual place, dozing and talking to himself, while Uncle Remus oiled the carriage harness. After a while Aunt Tempy came in. The conversation turned on Daddy Jack's story about ""haunts"" and spirits [the previous story in the collection, ""Spirits, Seen and Unseen""]. Finally Tildy said, ""When it comes to tales about haunts, I hear tell of one that will just naturally make the kinks on your head uncurl themselves."" ""What tale is that, child?"" asked Aunt Tempy. ""Uncle Remus, must I tell it?"" ""Let it come,"" said Uncle Remus. ""Well then,"" said Tildy, rolling her eyes back and displaying her white teeth: In describing the silver dollars Tildy joined the ends of her thumbs and forefingers together, and made a figure as large as a saucer. ""They were lots bigger that dollars are these days."" She continued: Well, then the man, he took and dug the grave and made ready to bury the woman. He looked at that money on her eyelids, and it shined mighty pretty. Then he took it off and felt it. It felt might good, but just about that time, the man looked at the woman, and he saw her eyelids open. It looked like she was looking at him, and he took and put the money where he got it from. Well, then the man, he took and got a wagon and hauled the woman out to the burying ground, and when he got there he fixed everything, and then he grabbed the money and covered up the grave right quick. Then he went home and put the money in a tin box and rattled it around. It rattled loud and it rattled nice, but the man, he didn't feel so good. It seems like he knew the woman's eyelids were stretched wide open looking for him. Yet he rattled the money around, and it rattled loud and it rattled nice. Well, then the man, he took and put the tin box with the money on the mantel shelf. The day went by, and night came, and when night came, the wind began to rise up and blow. It rose high and it blew strong. It blew on top of the house. It blew under the house. It blew around the house. The man, he felt queer. He sat by the fire and listened. The wind said ""Buzz-zoo-o-o-o-o!"" The man listened. The wind hollered and cried. It blew on top of the house. It blew under the house. It blew around the house. It blew into the house. The man got close to the chimney jamb. The wind found the cracks and blew in them. ""Bizzy, bizzy, buzz-zoo-o-o-o-o!"" Well, then the man, he listened and listened, but by and by he got tired of this, and he allowed to himself that he was going to bed. He took and flung a freshly lighted knot into the fire, and then he jumped into bed, and curled himself up, and put his head under the covers. The wind hunted for the cracks, ""Bizzy-buzz, bizzy-buzz, buzz-zoo-o-o-o-o!"" The man kept his head under the covers. The lighted knot flared up and flickered. The man didn't dare to move. The wind blew and whistled, ""Phew-fee-e-e-e!"" The lighted knot flickered and flared. The man, he kept his head covered. Well, then the man lay there, and got scareder and scareder. He scarcely dared to wink his eyes, and it seemed like he was going to have swamp fever. While he was lying there shaking, and the wind was a-blowing, and the fire flickering, he heard some other kind of noise. It was a mighty curious kind of noise, ""Clinkity, clinkalinkle!"" The man said, ""Hey! Who is stealing my money?"" But he kept his head covered while he lay and listened. He heard the wind blow, and then he heard that other kind of noise, ""Clinkity, clink, clinkity, clinkalinkle!"" Well, then he flung off the covers and sat right up in bed. He looked, but he didn't see anything. The fire flickered and flared, and the wind blew. The man went and put a chain and a bar across the door. Then he went back to bed, and he had no more than touched his head on the pillow when he heard this other noise, ""Clink, clink, clinkity, clinkalinkle!"" The man got up, but he didn't see anything at all. Mighty queer! Just about the time was going to lie down again, here came the noise, ""Clinkity, clinkalinkle."" It sounded like it was on the mantle shelf. Not only that, it sounded like it was in the tin box on the mantle shelf. Not only that, it sounded like it was the money in the tin box on the mantle shelf. The man said, ""Hey! A rat done got in the box!"" The man looked. No rat was there. He shut up the box and set it down on the shelf. As he did that, here came the noise, ""Clinkity, clinkity, clinkalinkle!"" The man opened the box and looked at the money. Those two silver dollars were lying there just like he put them. While the man was doing this, it seemed liked he could hear something saying, away off yonder, ""Where's my money? Oh, give me my money! I want my money!"" Well, then the man got scared sure enough, and he got a flatiron and put it on the tin box, and then he took and piled all the chairs against the door, and ran and jumped into bed. He just knew there was a boogie coming. By the time he got into bed and covered his head, the money rattled louder, and something cried away off yonder, ""I want my money! Oh, give me my money!"" The man, he shook and he shivered. The money, it clinked and rattled. And the boogie, it hollered and cried. The boogie came closer. The money clinked louder. The man shook worse and worse. The money said, ""Clinkity, clinkalinkle!"" The boogie cried, ""Oh, give me my money!"" The man hollered, ""Oh, Lordy, Lordy!"" Well, then it kept on this way until the man heard the door open. He peeped from under the covers, and in walked the woman that he had buried in the burying ground. The man shivered and shivered. The wind blew and blew. The money rattled and rattled. The woman cried and cried. ""Buzz-zoo-o-o-o-o!"" said the wind. ""Clinkalink!"" said the box. ""Oh, give me my money!"" said the woman. ""Oh, Lordy!"" said the man. The woman heard the money, but it looked like she couldn't see it, and she groped around, and groped around, and groped around with her hands in the air like this. The wind was blowing. The fire was flickering. The money was rattling. The man was shaking and shivering. The woman was groping around and saying, ""Give me my money! Oh, who's got my money?"" As she reached this climax, Tildy sprang at Daddy Jack and seized him, and for a few moments there was considerable confusion in the corner. The little boy was frightened, but the collapsed appearance of Daddy Jack convulsed him with laughter. The old African was very angry. His little eyes glistened with momentary malice, and he shook his cane threateningly at Tildy. The latter coolly adjusted her earrings, as she exclaimed, ""There now! I knew I'd get even with the old villain. Come a-calling me pigeon-toed!"" ""Better keep your eye on him, child,"" said Aunt Tempy. ""He'll bewitch you for sure."" ""Bewitch who? If he comes bewitching around me, I'll break his back, I'm telling you that right point-blank.""",Joel Chandler Harris,"Source: Joel Chandler Harris, Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1883), no. 29, pp. 161-66.",NA,Dialect normalized by D.

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,Ahlemann,"His wife went to town and bought a nice large liver. After it was fried, and the husband still hadn't come home, it smelled so good that wanted some ever so much. Finally she sat down and tasted it herself. First she ate just a very little piece, thinking, ""He will never notice it."" But then she cut off another little piece, and soon the entire liver was gone. Then she became terribly frightened that her husband would scold her, so she ran to the gallows where someone was hanging whom they had hanged a short time ago. She cut out his liver and fried it. When Ahlemann came home he sat down, and it tasted marvelous. Afterward he went for beer with his children. Evening came, and it was already dark. The woman was lying in her bed when she heard something approaching her room. A voice called out, ""Where is Ah-lemann? Where is Ah-lemann?"" She said, ""Ahlemann has gone for beer with all four!"" But she heard it coming closer and closer, and she called out in fear, ""Come Ah-lemann; come Ah-lemann. I am terribly afraid."" But it was to no avail.

During the night someone comes demanding the bone, and at length the terrified old woman gives it up. A similar story is told in Cornwall. An old lady had been to the church in the sands of Perranzabuloe. She found, amidst the numerous remains of mortality, some very good teeth. She pocketed these, and at night placed them on her dressing table before getting into bed. She slept, but was at length disturbed by someone calling out, ""Give me my teeth. Give me my teeth."" At first, the lady took no notice of this, but the cry, ""Give me my teeth,"" was so constantly repeated, that she, at last, in terror, jumped out of bed, took the teeth from the dressing table, and, opening the window, flung them out, exclaiming, ""Drat the teeth, take 'em!"" They no sooner fell into the darkness on the road than hasty retreating footsteps were heard, and there were no more demands for the teeth.",England,"Source: Robert Hunt, Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of Old Cornwall, second series (London: John Camden Hotten, 1865), pp. 268-69.","Hunt entitles this tale ""Cornish Teeny-Tiny.""",NA
A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,How to Tell a Story: The Golden Arm,"On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in front of the snapper on the end, and that pause was the most im portant thing in the whole story. If I got it the right length precisely, I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seat -- and that was what I was after. This story was called "" The Golden Arm,"" and was told in this fash ion. You can practise with it yourself -- and mind you look out for the pause and get it right.

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,Saddaedda,"Once upon a time there was a girl called Saddaedda, who was crazy. One day, when her mother had gone into the country and she was left alone in the house, she went into a church where the funeral service was being read over the body of a rich lady. The girl hid herself in the confessional. No one knew she was there. So, when the other people had gone, she was left alone with the corpse. It was dressed out in a rose-colored robe and everything else becoming, and it had earrings in its ears and rings on its fingers. These the girl took off, and then she began to undress the body. When she came to the stockings she drew off one easily, but at the other she had to pull so hard that at last the leg came off with it. Saddaedda took the leg, carried it to her lonely home, and locked it up in a box. At night came the dead lady and knocked at the door. ""Who's there?"" said the girl. ""It is I,"" answered the corpse. ""Give me back my leg and stocking!"" But Saddaedda paid no heed to the request. Next day she prepared a feast and invited some of her playfellows to spend the night with her. They came, feasted, and went to sleep. At midnight the dead woman began to knock at the door and to repeat last night's request. Saddaedda took no notice of the noise, but her companions, whom it awoke, were horrified, and as soon as they could, they ran away. On the third night just the same happened. On the fourth she could persuade only one girl to keep her company. On the fifth she was left entirely alone. The corpse came, forced open the door, strode up to Saddaedda's bed, and strangled her. Then the dead woman opened the box, took out her leg and stocking, and carried them off with her to her grave.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company; London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 73, p. 238.",NA,NA

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,The Audacious Girl,"In Pinno some people lived directly next to the churchyard, and when their daughter went to the spinning room in the evening she always had to walk through the churchyard. The young fellows teased her about this and told her that something would happen to her if she continued to walk by herself through the churchyard. One evening when she was once again walking through the churchyard on her way to the spinning room, she saw a figure sitting on a grave. She thought it was one of the young fellows trying to frighten her, so she went up to the figure and ripped something off its body. She ran with it to the spinning room and said, ""You tried to play a trick on me, but you failed! I took this away from the fellow who was trying to trick me!"" The other spinning girls said to her, ""That is a burial shroud that you have in your hands."" She was frightened as she made her way home. The young fellows and girls went with her, and nothing happened to her. In the night something knocked on her window, and a voice called out, ""Give me my things. I'm freezing.!"" She was afraid to give the things back, and there came another knock. Then she opened the window a little and reached the things out with a stick. But outside no one took them. Every night the knocking and the calling came again. Then the girl went with her mother to the pastor and told him about it. The pastor said that he and the teacher would go with her to take the things back to the same place where she had taken them. When all three were standing at the grave they heard the girl cry, ""My Jesus! My Jesus!"" Suddenly the girl disappeared from their midst. They found only a few tattered pieces of her clothing lying there next to them. The Evil One had torn the girl apart and taken her with him. In a village there was once a very audacious girl who wanted to have something from the churchyard, for such things were considered to be of value. The girl went to the churchyard at twelve o'clock in the night. There she saw a white figure sitting on a grave. It had a white cloth wrapped around its head. The girl unwrapped the cloth and took it with her. The next night the white figure came to the girl's bed and wanted the have the cloth back. This happened every night. Then the frightened girl ran to the pastor and told him about it. He said that she would have to take the cloth back to the place she had taken it from.

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,The Golden Arm,"There was once a man who traveled the land all over in search of a wife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could not meet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman young, fair, and rich, who possessed the supreme, the crowning glory of having a right arm of solid gold. He married her at once, and thought no man so fortunate as he was. They lived happily together, but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was fonder of the golden arm than of all his wife's gifts besides. At last she died. The husband appeared inconsolable. He put on the blackest black, and pulled the longest face at the funeral. But for all that he got up in the middle of the night, dug up the body, and cut off the golden arm. He hurried home to secrete his recovered treasure, and thought no one would know. The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was just falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room.

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,The Shroud,"In a certain village there was a girl who was lazy and slothful, hated working, but would gossip and chatter away like anything! Well, she took it into her head to invite the other girls to a spinning party. For in the villages, as every one knows, it is the lazybones who gives the spinning feast, and the sweet-toothed are those who go to it. Well, on the appointed night she got her spinners together. They span for her, and she fed them and feasted them. Among other things they chatted about was this -- which of them all was the boldest? Says the lazybones, ""I'm not afraid of anything!"" ""Well then,"" say the spinners, ""if you're not afraid, go past the graveyard to the church, take down the holy picture from the door, and bring it here."" ""Good, I'll bring it; only each of you must spin me a distaff-full."" That was just her sort of notion: to do nothing herself, but to get others to do it for her. Well, she went, took down the picture, and brought it home with her. Her friends all saw that sure enough it was the picture from the church. But the picture had to be taken back again, and it was now the midnight hour. Who was to take it? At length the lazybones said, ""You girls go on spinning. I'll take it back myself. I'm not afraid of anything!"" So she went and put the picture back in its place. As she was passing the graveyard on her return, she saw a corpse in a white shroud, seated on a tomb. It was a moonlight night; everything was visible. She went up to the corpse, and drew away its shroud from it. The corpse held its peace, not uttering a word; no doubt the time for it to speak had not come yet. Well, she took the shroud and went home. ""There!"" says she, ""I've taken back the picture and put it in its place; and, what's more, here's a shroud I took away from a corpse."" Some of the girls were horrified; others didn't believe what she said, and laughed at her. But after they had supped and lain down to sleep, all of a sudden the corpse tapped at the window and said, ""Give me my shroud! Give me my shroud!"" The girls were so frightened they didn't know whether they were alive or dead. But the lazybones took the shroud, went to the window, opened it, and said, ""There, take it."" ""No,"" replied the corpse, ""restore it to the place you took it from."" Just then the cocks suddenly began to crow. The corpse disappeared. Next night, when the spinners had all gone home to their own houses, at the very same hour as before, the corpse came, tapped at the window, and cried, ""Give me my shroud!"" Well, the girl's father and mother opened the window and offered him his shroud. ""No,"" says he, ""let her take it back to the place she took it from."" ""Really now, how could one go to a graveyard with a corpse? What a horrible idea!"" she replied. Just then the cocks crew. The corpse disappeared. Next day the girl's father and mother sent for the priest, told him the whole story, and entreated him to help them in their trouble. ""Couldn't a service be performed?"" they said. The priest reflected awhile; then he replied, ""Please tell her to come to church tomorrow."" Next day the lazybones went to church. The service began, numbers of people came to it. But just as they were going to sing the cherubim song, there suddenly arose, goodness knows whence, so terrible a whirlwind that all the congregation fell flat on their faces. And it caught up that girl, and then flung her down on the ground. The girl disappeared from sight; nothing was left of her but her back hair.",Russia,"Source: W. R. S.

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,The Stolen Liver,"In the village of Hammer near Czernikowo many years ago there lived a young married couple. The wife loved to eat liver and could not live if she didn't eat a liver every day. One day she sent her husband once again to town to fetch a liver. However, in Czernikowo the husband met a group of young merrymakers and went with them to a tavern, where he drank away all his money. Sad, and without the liver, he made his way homeward. It was late. On his way he had to go through a great forest. Here he met a hunter, who asked him why he was so sad. The man told him everything, upon which the hunter said, ""In the middle of the forest there is a clearing with a gallows, upon which a number of dead bodies are hanging. Take one of them down, cut out his liver, and give it to your wife. Tell her it is beef liver."" The man did just that. When he arrived home his wife was at first angry because he had been away so long, but she calmed down as soon as she saw the liver, and began frying it. The man lay down and went to sleep. Suddenly a white figure appeared at the window, and it cried into the room, ""Everyone is asleep. The dogs are keeping watch in the yard. And you are standing there frying my liver."" The man was terrified, and in his fear he cried out to his wife that she should come to bed. But the wife wanted first to dip a little piece of bread into the gravy and taste it. Meanwhile, the phantom, a white skeleton, had already entered the house, always calling out the same words again and again. The woman was not afraid, but asked the ghost, ""Now, my little fellow, what happened to your flesh?"" The ghost replied, ""The ravens ate it, and the wind blew it away."" Then the woman asked, ""Now, my little fellow, what happened to your eyes and ears?"" And the ghost answered, ""The ravens ate them, and the wind blew them away."" The woman asked, ""Now, my little fellow, what happened to your liver?"" Then the ghost cried out, ""You have it!""

A Corpse Claims Its Property,0366,White Cap,"A certain boy and girl, whose names this tale telleth not, once lived near a church. The boy being mischievously inclined, was in the habit of trying to frighten the girl in a variety of ways, till she became at last so accustomed to his tricks, that she ceased to care for anything whatever, putting down everything strange that she saw and heard to the boy's mischief. One washing-day, the girl was sent by her mother to fetch home the linen, which had been spread to dry in the churchyard. When she had nearly filled her basket, she happened to look up, and saw sitting on a tomb near her a figure dressed in white from head to foot, but was not the least alarmed, believing it to be the boy playing her, as usual, a trick. So she ran up to it, and pulling its cap off said, ""You shall not frighten me, this time."" Then when she had finished collecting the linen she went home. But, to her astonishment -- for he could not have reached home before her without her seeing him -- the boy was the first person who greeted her on her arrival at the cottage. Among the linen, too, when it was sorted, was found a moldy white cap, which appeared to be nobody's property, and which was half full of earth. The next morning the ghost (for it was a ghost that the girl had seen) was found sitting with no cap upon its head, upon the same tombstone as the evening before. And as nobody had the courage to address it, or knew in the least how to get rid of it, they sent into the neighboring village for advice. An old man declared that the only way to avoid some general calamity, was for the little girl to replace on the ghost's head the cap she had seized from it, in the presence of many people, all of whom were to be perfectly silent. So a crowd collected in the churchyard, and the little girl, going forward, half afraid, with the cap, placed it upon the ghost's head, saying, ""Are you satisfied now?"" But the ghost, raising its hand, gave her a fearful blow, and said, ""Yes, but are you now satisfied?"" The little girl fell down dead, and at the same instant the ghost sank into the grave upon which it had been sitting, and was no more seen.",Iceland,"Source: Jón Arnason, Icelandic Legends, translated by George E.

Next year the field was sown with turnip seed, and Jack said, ""You shall have tops this time."" The devil agreed to this, and in due time Jack had the turnips, leaving his partner the green tops. After that they went to mow a field of grass, each one to have all the hay he could cut. They were to begin together in the morning. Jack got up in the night and put harrow tines in the grass on the side of the meadow where the devil was to mow. In the morning these notched and blunted the scythe, which was continually catching in them; but the ""Old 'Un,"" thinking they were only burdocks, kept muttering, ""Burdock, Jack! Burdock Jack!"" Jack took no notice, and, mowing away diligently, secured nearly all the crop for himself once more. Then they went to threshing.

Because his string was always getting tangled up, the devil had to keep running back and forth in order to untangle it, and he was only half finished when Saint John had completed his work. The devil was very angry at having lost this first wager. He then pointed to a field and said, ""Let us take what is growing there and share it, each of us to receive half. Do you want the top or the bottom?"" Saint John looked and saw that it was a field of turnips. He chose the bottom half. The devil was happy to get the top half, thinking that it was the best part, the bottom part being only thin, bitter roots. The two returned when the turnips had grown and were ready to harvest. Then the devil received only a little pile of half-withered, wormy leaves, whereas Saint John received a large pile of the most beautiful and juiciest turnips. When the devil became angry again, Saint John pointed to another field and asked, ""Do you want to wager once again?"" ""Yes indeed,"" replied the devil, ""but this time I'll take the bottom half.""

Crop Division between Man and Ogre,1030,The Bogie and the Farmer,"One of these spirits [a Bogie] once asserted a claim to a field hitherto possessed by a farmer, and, after much disputing, they came to an arrangement by agreeing to divide its produce between them. At seed-time the farmer asks the Bogie what part of the crop he will have, ""tops or bottoms."" ""Bottoms,"" said the spirit. Upon hearing which his crafty antagonist sows the field with wheat, so that when harvest arrived the corn [grain] falls to his share, while the poor Bogie is obliged to content himself with the stubble. Next year the Bogie, finding he had made such an unfortunate selection in the bottoms, chose the ""tops,"" whereupon the crafty farmer sets the field with turnips -- thus, again, outwitting the simple claimant. Tired of this unprofitable farming, the Bogie agrees to hazard his claims on a mowing match, the land in question to be the stake for which they played. Before the day of meeting the canny earth-tiller procures a number of iron bars, which he strews among the grass to be mown by his opponent; and when the trial commences, the unsuspecting goblin finds his progress retarded by his scythe continually coming into contact with these obstacles, which he takes to be some hard species of dock. ""Mortal hard docks these!"" said he. ""Nation hard docks!"" His blunted blade soon brings him to a standstill; and as, in such cases, it is not allowable for one to sharpen without the other, he turns to his antagonist, now far ahead, and in a tone of despair inquires, ""When dye wiffle waffle (whet), mate?"" ""Waffle!"" said the farmer, with a well-feigned stare of amazement, ""oh, about noon, mebby."" ""Then,"" said the despairing Bogie, ""I've lost my land!""

Crop Division between Man and Ogre,1030,The Farmer and the Devil on Island of the Popefigs,"Pantagruel ... was told that for the last three years there had raged in the island a pestilence so horrible, that the half or more of the country had remained desolate, and the lands without occupiers. When the pestilence had gone by, this man ... was plowing a large and fertile piece of ground and sowing it with wheat at the very day and hour that a small devil (one who did not know how to thunder or hail except only on parsley and cabbages, and moreover could not yet read or write) had obtained leave from Lucifer to go for a holiday and recreation in this Island of the Popefigs, wherein the devils were very familiar with the men and women, and often went there to pass their time. This devil, having got to the place, addressed himself to the laborer, and asked him what he was doing. The poor man answered him that he was sowing this field with wheat, to help him to live the following year. ""Nay, but this field is none of thine,"" said the devil. ""It is mine, and belongs to me; for ... all this country was adjudged, proscribed and given up to us. To sow corn, however, is not my province; wherefore I leave thee the field, but on condition that we share the profit."" ""I am willing,"" answered the laborer. ""I mean,"" said the devil, ""that we are to make two lots of the profit that results. One shall be that which grows above the earth, the other that which shall be covered by the earth. The right of choosing belongs to me, for I am a devil, born of a noble and ancient race; thou art but a clown. I make choice of that which shall be in the earth. Thou shall have that which is above. At what time shall be the in-gathering?"" ""About the middle of July,"" answered the laborer. ""Very well,"" said the devil, ""I will not fail to be here. Meantime do as is thy duty to do. Work, villain, work. I am off to tempt to the gallant sin of luxury, the noble nuns of Pette-sec, also the cowled hypocrites and gluttons. Of their desires I am more than assured. They have but to meet, and the combat takes place."" When mid July had come, the devil presented himself at the place, accompanied by a troop of little devilkins of the choir. There, finding the laborer, he said, ""Now, villain, how hast thou done since my departure? It is fitting now that we should make out our shares."" ""It is but reason,"" answered the laborer. Then the laborer and his men began to reap the corn. The devilkins likewise pulled up the stubble from the earth. The laborer threshed his corn on the threshing floor, winnowed it, put it in sacks and carried it to market to sell. The imps did the same, and set themselves down at the marketplace, near the laborer, to sell their stubble. The laborer sold his corn very well, and with the money filled an old half-buskin, which he carried at his girdle. The devils sold nothing. Nay, on the contrary, the peasants jeered at them in open market. When the market was over, the devil said to the laborer, ""Villain, thou hast cheated me this time. Next time thou shall not do so."" ""Master Devil,"" said the laborer, ""how could I have cheated you, when you had the first choice? The truth is, that in this choice you thought to cheat me, expecting that nothing would come out of the earth for my share, and that you would find below the whole of the grain which I had sown, intending therewith to tempt the poor and needy, the hypocrites, or the misers, and by temptation to make them fall into your snares. But you are mighty young at your trade. The grain which you see in the earth is dead and rotten. The corruption of that has caused the generation of the other, which you saw me sell. So you do choose the worse. That is why you are cursed in the Gospel."" ""Let us leave this subject,"" said the devil. ""What canst thou sow our field with next year? "" ""To make a profit like a good husbandman,"" said the laborer, ""the proper thing would be to sow turnips."" ""Well,"" said the devil, ""thou art an honest clown. Sow turnips in abundance. I will guard them from the storm, and will not hail upon them. But understand thoroughly: I retain for my share that which shall be above ground. Thou shall have all that is below. Work, villain, work. I am off to tempt the heretics. Their souls are dainty morsels when broiled on the coals. My lord Lucifer has the colic; they will make a tid-bit for him."" When the time of gathering was come, the devil appeared on the ground with a squadron of waiting devilkins. There, finding the laborer and his men, he began to cut and gather the leaves of the turnips. After him the laborer dug and pulled up the big turnips, and put them into sacks. So they all go off together to market. The laborer sold his turnips very well. The devil sold nothing, and, what was worse, they jeered at him publicly. ""I see very well, villain,"" said the devil, ""that I have been cheated by thee.

One day the peasant had been working in his field, and just as it was getting dark he was getting ready to go home when in the middle of his field he saw a pile of burning coals. Filled with amazement he walked toward it, and sitting on the top of the glowing coals there was a little black devil. ""You must be sitting on a treasure,"" said the peasant. ""Yes indeed,"" replied the devil, ""on a treasure that contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life."" ""The treasure is in my field and belongs to me,"" said the peasant. ""It is yours,"" answered the devil, ""if for two years you will give me one half of everything your field produces. I have enough money, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth."" The peasant entered into the bargain, saying, ""To prevent any dispute from arising about the division, everything above the ground shall belong to you, and everything beneath the ground to me."" The devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had planted turnips. Now when harvest time came the devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop, but he found nothing except the yellow withered leaves, and the happy peasant dug up his turnips. ""You got the best of me this time,"" said the devil, ""but it won't happen again. Next time what grows above ground shall be yours, and what is under it shall be mine."" ""That is all right with me,"" answered the peasant. When planting time came the peasant did not plant turnips again, but wheat. The crop ripened, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks off at ground level.

"Death of an Underground Person, or of the King of the Cats",6070b,Johnny Reed's Cat,"And who was Johnny Reed? And what was there remarkable about his cat? Have you never heard tell of Johnny Reed's cat? It's an old tale they have in the north country, and it's true enough, though folk may not believe it in these days when the Bible's not gospel enough for some of them. I've heard my father often tell the story, and he came from Newcastle way, which is the very part where Johnny Reed used to live, being a parish sexton in a village not far away. Well, Johnny Reed was the sexton, as I've already said, and he and his wife kept a cat, a well enough behaved creature, sure enough, and a beast as he had no fault to set on, saving a few of the tricks which all cats play at times, and which seem born in the blood of the creatures. It was all black except one white paw, and seemed as honest and decent a beast as could be, and Tom would as soon have suspected it of being any more than it really seemed to be as he would one of his own children themselves, like many other folk, perhaps, who, may be, have cats of the same kind, little thinking it. Well, the cat had been with him some years when a strange thing occurred. One night Johnny was going home late from the churchyard, where he had been digging a grave for a person who had died on a sudden, throwing the grave on Johnny's hands unexpectedly, so that he had to stop working at it by the light of a lantern to have it ready for the next day's burying. Well, having finished his work, and having put his tools in the shed in a corner of the yard, and having locked them up safe, he began to walk home pretty brisk, thinking would his wife be up and have a bit of fire for him, for the night was cold, a keen wind blowing over the fields. He hadn't gone far before he comes to a gate at the roadside, and there seemed to be a strange shadow about it, in which Johnny saw, as it might be, a lot of little gleaming fires dancing about, while some stood steady, just like flashes of light from little windows in buildings all on fire inside. Says Johnny to himself, for he was not a man to be easily frightened, being accustomed by his calling to face things which might upset other folk, ""'Hullo! What's here? Here's a thing I never saw before."" And with that he walks straight up to the gate, while the shadow got deeper and the fires brighter the nearer he came to it. Well, when he came right up to the gate he finds that the shadow was just none at all, but nine black cats, some sitting and some dancing about, and the lights were the flashes from their eyes. When he came nearer he thought to scare them off, and he calls out, ""Sh -- sh -- sh,"" but never a cat stirs for all of it. ""I'll soon scatter you, you ugly varmin,"" says Johnny, looking about him for a stone, which was not to be found, the night being dark and preventing him seeing one. Just then he hears a voice calling, '""Johnny Reed!"" ""Hullo!"" says he, ""Who's that wants me?"" ""Johnny Reed,"" says the voice again. ""Well,"" says Johnny, ""I'm here,"" and looking round and seeing no one, for no one was about 'tis true. ""Was it one of you,"" says he, joking like, to the cats, ""as was calling me?"" ""Yes, of course,"" answers one of them, as plain as ever Christian spoke. ""It's me as has called you these three times."" Well, with that, you may be sure, Johnny begins to feel curious, for 'twas the first time he had ever been spoken to by a cat, and he didn't know what it might lead to exactly. So he takes off his hat to the cat, thinking that it was, perhaps, best to show it respect, and, seeing that he was unable to guess with whom he was dealing, hoping to come off all the better for a little civility. ""Well, sir,"" says he, ""what can I do for you?"" ""It's not much as I want with you,"" says the cat, ""but it's better it'll be with you if you do what I tell you. Tell Dan Ratcliffe that Peggy Poyson's dead."" ""I will, sir,"" says Johnny, wondering at the same time how he was to do it, for who Dan Ratcliffe was he knew no more than the dead. Well, with that all the cats vanished, and Johnny, running the rest of the way home, rushes into his house, smoking hot from the fright and the distance he had to go over. ""Nan,"" says he to his wife, the first words he spoke, ""who's Dan Ratcliffe?"" ""Dan Ratcliffe,"" says she. ""I never heard of him, and don't know there's any one such living about here."" ""No more do I,"" says he, '""but I must find him wherever he is."" Then he tells his wife all about how he had met the cats, and how they had stopped him and given him the message. Well, his cat sits there in front of the fire looking as snug and comfortable as a cat could be, and nearly half asleep, but when Johnny comes to telling his wife the message the cats had given him, then it jumped up on its feet, and looks at Johnny, and says, ""What! Is Peggy Poyson dead? Then it's no time for me to be here."" And with that it springs through the door and vanishes, nor was ever seen again from that day to this. ""And did the sexton ever find Dan Ratcliffe,"" I asked. Never. He searched high and low for him about, but no one could tell him of such a person, though Johnny looked long enough, thinking it might be the worse for him if he didn't do his best to please the cats. At last, however, he gave the matter up. Then, what was the meaning of the cat's message? It's hard to tell; but many folk thought, and I'm inclined to agree with them, that Dan Ratcliffe was Johnny's own cat, and no one else, looking at the way he acted, and no other of the name being known. Who Peggy Poyson was no one could tell, but likely enough it was some relative of the cat, or may be someone it was interested in, for it's little we know concerning the creatures and their ways, and with whom and what they're mixed up.",England,"Source: [Charles John Tibbits], Folk-Lore and Legends: English (London: W.

He stopped his horse and looked round, but could see no one. Thinking that his imagination must have deceived him, he began to move on, but was again arrested by the voice. A second time he stopped and looked round, but with no more success than the first. Beginning to feel alarmed, he pushed his horse forward, but was a third time stopped by the voice. He now summoned up all his courage and asked who it was that called, and what was required of him. The voice immediately answered, ""Go home directly and tell P'tit Colin that Grand Colin is dead."" Wondering what could be the meaning of this, he made the best of his way home, and, on his arrival, sent for Le Petit Colin, to whom he communicated what had befallen him. The boy replied, ""What! Is Le Grand Colin dead? Then I must leave you,"" and immediately turned round to depart. ""Stop,"" said Mess Dumaresq, ""I must pay you your wages.""

"Death of an Underground Person, or of the King of the Cats",6070b,The King of the Cats,"A man once, in a fit of passion, cut off the head of the domestic pussy, and threw it on the fire. On which the head exclaimed, in a fierce voice, ""Go tell your wife that you have cut off the head of the King of the Cats; but wait! I shall come back and be avenged for this insult,"" and the eyes of the cat glared at him horribly from the fire. And so it happened; for that day year, while the master of the house was playing with a pet kitten, it suddenly flew at his throat and bit him so severely that he died soon after. A story is current also, that one night an old woman was sitting up very late spinning, when a knocking came to the door. ""Who is there?"" she asked. No answer; but still the knocking went on. ""Who is there?"" she asked a second time. No answer; and the knocking continued. ""Who is there?"" she asked the third time, in a very angry passion. Then there came a small voice, ""Ah, Judy, agrah, let me in, for I am cold and hungry; open the door, Judy, agrah, and let me sit by the fire, for the night is cold out here. Judy, agrah, let me in, let me in!"" The heart of Judy was touched, for she thought it was some small child that had lost its way, and she rose up from her spinning, and went and opened the door -- when in walked a large black cat with a white breast, and two white kittens after her. They all made over to the fire and began to warm and dry themselves, purring all the time very loudly; but Judy said never a word, only went on spinning. Then the black cat spoke at last, ""Judy, agrah, don't stay up so late again, for the fairies wanted to hold a council here tonight, and to have some supper, but you have prevented them; so they were very angry and determined to kill you, and only for myself and my two daughters here you would be dead by this time. So take my advice, don't interfere with the fairy hours again, for the night is theirs, and they hate to look on the face of a mortal when they are out for pleasure or business. So I ran on to tell you, and now give me a drink of milk, for I must be off."" And after the milk was finished the cat stood up, and called her daughters to come away. ""Good-night, Judy, agrah,"" she said. ""You have been very civil to me, and I'll not forget it to you. Good-night, goodnight."" With that the black cat and the two kittens whisked up the chimney; but Judy looking down saw something glittering on the hearth, and taking it up she found it was a piece of silver, more than she ever could make in a month by her spinning, and she was glad in her heart, and never again sat up so late to interfere with the fairy hours, but the black cat and her daughters came no more again to the house. Many years ago, long before shooting in Scotland was a fashion as it is now, two young men spent the autumn in the very far north, living in a lodge far from other houses, with an old woman to cook for them. Her cat and their own dogs formed all the rest of the household. One afternoon the elder of the two young men said he would not go out, and the younger one went alone, to follow the path of the previous day's sport looking for missing birds, and intending to return home before the early sunset. However, he did not do so, and the elder man became very uneasy as he watched and waited in vain till long after their usual supper-time. At last the young man returned, wet and exhausted, nor did he explain his unusual lateness until, after supper, they were seated by the fire with their pipes, the dogs lying at their feet, and the old woman's black cat sitting gravely with half-shut eyes on the hearth between them. Then the young man began as follows:-- ""You must be wondering what made me so late. I have had a curious adventure to-day. I hardly know what to say about it. I went, as I told you I should, along our yesterday's route. A mountain fog came on just as I was about to turn homewards, and I completely lost my way. I wandered about for a long time, not knowing where I was, till at last I saw a light, and made for it, hoping to get help. As I came near it, it disappeared, and I found myself close to a large old oak-tree. I climbed into the branches the better to look for the light, and, behold! it was beneath me, inside the hollow trunk of the tree. I seemed to be looking down into a church, where a funeral was in the act of taking place. I heard singing, and saw a coffin, surrounded by torches, all carried by ---- But I know you won't believe me if I tell you!"" His friend eagerly begged him to go on, and laid down his pipe to listen. The dogs were sleeping quietly, but the cat was sitting up apparently listening as attentively as the man, and both young men involuntarily turned their eyes towards him. ""Yes,"" proceeded the absentee,"" it is perfectly true. The coffin and the torches were both borne by cats, and upon the coffin were marked a crown and scepter!"" He got no further; the cat started up shrieking, ""By Jove! old Peter's dead! and I'm the King o' the Cats!"" rushed up the chimney and was seen no more.",Ireland Scotland,"Source: Lady [Jane Francesca Elgee] Wilde, Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland (Boston: Ticknor and Company, 1888), pp. 153-54.

"Death of an Underground Person, or of the King of the Cats",6070b,The Troll Turned Cat,"About a quarter of a mile from Soröe lies Pedersborg, and a little farther on is the town of Lyng. Just between these towns is a hill called Bröndhöi (Spring-hill), said to be inhabited by the troll-people. There goes a story that there was once among these troll-people of Bröndhöi an old cross-grained curmudgeon of a troll, whom the rest nick-named Knurremurre (Rumble-grumble), because he was evermore the cause of noise and uproar within the hill. The Knurremurre having discovered what he thought to be too great a degree of intimacy between his young wife and a young troll of the society, took this in such ill part, that he vowed vengeance, swearing he would have the life of the young one. The latter, accordingly, thought it would be his best course to be off out of the hill till better times; so, turning himself into a noble tortoise-shell tom-cat, he one fine morning quitted his old residence, and journeyed down to the neighboring town of Lyng, where he established himself in the house of an honest poor man named Plat. Here he lived for a long time comfortable and easy, with nothing to annoy him, and was as happy as any tom-cat or troll crossed in love well could be. He got every day plenty of milk and good grout to eat, and lay the whole day long at his ease in a warm arm-chair behind the stove. Plat happened one evening to come home rather late, and as he entered the room the cat was sitting in his usual place, scraping meal-grout out of a pot, and licking the pot itself carefully. ""Harkye, dame,"" said Plat, as he came in at the door, ""till I tell you what happened to me on the road. Just as I was coming past Bröndhöi, there came out a troll, and he called out to me, and said, The moment the cat heard these words, he tumbled the pot down on the floor, sprang out of the chair, and stood up on his hind-legs. Then, as he hurried out of the door, he cried out with exultation, ""What! is Knurremurre dead? Then I may go home as fast as I please.""

"Death of an Underground Person, or of the King of the Cats",6070b,Torke's Child Is Dead / Kilian's Child Is Dead,"Near Westerhausen there are dwarf caves. Ages ago dwarfs lived there, and they were very active in the region. Once a peasant was driving from Halberstadt to Börneke, which lies about a half hour from Westerhausen. As he was approaching Mount Tekenberg, someone shouted to him, ""Wedgehead, tell Torke to come home. His child is dead!"" He looked around, but peering far and wide he could not see anyone who could have called out. So he drove home, and after his arrival there, while seated at his table, it kept going around in his head that someone had shouted to him and that he had seen no one. So he said to his wife, ""Just think, as I was approaching Mount Tekenberg, someone shouted to me, Wedgehead, tell Torke to come home. His child is dead!'"" He had scarcely said this when someone called out from the best room, ""Is that so? Then I must go there at once!"" Then they heard something fall. They went into the room and found there a bag. It was filled with dough from their baking trough. There were also many dwarfs in Mount Kuckuksberg near Westerhausen and in Mount Steinberg near Börneke. They were thick-headed people with black faces. They wore three-cornered hats. They sometimes helped humans and sometimes harmed them. When Old Fritz [Frederick the Great of Prussia] came to power, he did not want them in his country any more, and he exiled them to the other side of the Black Sea. Thus they all emigrated, and nothing more has been heard about them since then. Formerly, however, there were many stories about them. For example, once a peasant was driving past Mount Kuckuksberg when someone shouted to him, ""Leave your wagon and your horses here, and run home quickly, and tell Kilian he should come here. His child is dead!"" The peasant did that. Arriving at home, he gave the message, and suddenly the bread dough fell down from above, and someone said that in the future they should make three crosses on the bread when they leave the dough overnight, and then the dwarfs would not be able to take it away. For this reason, to this very day three crosses are made on bread.",Germany,"Source: A. Kuhn and W.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,Fitcher's Bird,"Once upon a time there was a sorcerer who was a thief. He disguised himself as a poor man and went begging from house to house. A girl came to the door and brought him a piece of bread. He touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket. Then he carried her to his house where everything was splendid, and he gave her everything that she wanted. One day he said, ""I have to take care of something away from home. I will be away for a while. Here is an egg. Take good care of it. Carry it with you at all times. And here is a key, but at the risk of your life, do not go into the room that it opens. But as soon as he had gone, she unlocked the door and went into the room. In the middle there was a large basin. In it there were dead and dismembered people. She was so terrified that she dropped the egg, which she was holding in her hand, into the basin. She quickly took it out again and wiped off the blood, but it reappeared in an instant. She could not get the egg clean, no matter how much she wiped and scrubbed. When the man returned, he asked for the egg and the key. He looked at them and knew that she had been in the blood chamber. ""You did not heed my words,"" he said angrily, ""and now you are going into the chamber against your will."" With that he seized her, led her into the room, cut her up in pieces, and threw her into the basin with the others. Sometime later the man went begging again. He captured the second daughter from the house, and the same thing happened to her as to the first one. She too opened the forbidden door, dropped the egg into the blood, and was cut to pieces and thrown into the basin. Then the sorcerer wanted to have the third daughter. He captured her in his pack basket, carried her home, and at his departure gave her the egg and the key. However, the third sister was clever and sly. First of all, she put the egg in a safe place, and then she went into the secret chamber. When she saw her sisters in the basin, she found all of their parts and put each one back in its right place: head, body, arm, and leg. The parts started to move, and then they joined together, and the two sister came back to life. She took them both out of the room and hid them. When the man returned and found that the egg was free of blood, he asked her to become his bride. She said yes, but told him that first he would have to carry a basket filled with gold on his back to her parents, and that meanwhile she would be getting ready for the wedding. Then she told her sisters to get help from home. She put them into the basket and covered them over with gold. Then she said to the man, ""Carry this away. And don't you dare stop to rest. If you do, I'll be able to see through my window."" He lifted the basket onto his back and started off, but it was so heavy that the weight nearly killed him. He wanted to rest a little, but one of the girls inside the basket called out, ""I can see through my window that you are resting. Walk on at once!"" He thought it was his bride calling out, so he got up and walked on. Every time he wanted to rest, he heard the call, and had to continue on. Meanwhile, back at his house, his bride dressed up a skull and placed it in the attic window. Then she invited all the sorcerer's friends to the wedding. Then she dipped herself in a barrel of honey, cut open the bed, and rolled in the feathers so that no one would be able to recognize her. In this strange disguise, she left the house and started down the path. Soon she met some of the guests, who said, ""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I'm coming from Fitcher's house."" ""And what is his young bride doing?"" ""She's cleaning the house from bottom to top. Right now she is looking out of the attic window."" Then she also met the bridegroom, who was returning home. ""You, Fitcher's bird, where are you coming from?"" ""I'm coming from Fitcher's house."" ""And what is my young bride doing?"" ""She's cleaning the house from bottom to top. Right now she is looking out of the attic window."" The bridegroom looked up, and saw the disguised skull. Thinking it was his bride, he waved to it.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,How the Devil Married Three Sisters,"Once upon a time the devil was seized with a desire to marry. He therefore left hell, took the form of a handsome young man, and built a fine large house. When it was completed and furnished in the most fashionable style he introduced himself to a family where there were three pretty daughters, and paid his addresses to the eldest of them. The handsome man pleased the maiden, her parents were glad to see a daughter so well provided for, and it was not long before the wedding was celebrated. When he had taken his bride home, he presented her with a very tastefully arranged bouquet, led her through all the rooms of the house, and finally to a closed door. ""The whole house is at your disposal,"" said he, ""only I must request one thing of you; that is, that you do not on any account open this door."" Of course the young wife promised faithfully; but equally, of course, she could scarcely wait for the moment to come when she might break her promise. When the devil had left the house the next morning, under pretence of going hunting, she ran hastily to the forbidden door, opened it, and saw a terrible abyss full of fire that shot up towards her, and singed the flowers on her bosom. When her husband came home and asked her whether she had kept her promise, she unhesitatingly said ""Yes."" But he saw by the flowers that she was telling a lie, and said, ""Now I will not put your curiosity to the test any longer. Come with me. I will show you myself what is behind the door."" Thereupon he led her to the door, opened it, gave her such a push that she fell down into hell, and shut the door again. A few months after he wooed the next sister for his wife, and won her; but with her everything that had happened with the first wife was exactly repeated. Finally he courted the third sister. She was a prudent maiden, and said to herself, ""He has certainly murdered my two sisters; but then it is a splendid match for me, so I will try and see whether I cannot be more fortunate than they."" And accordingly she consented. After the wedding the bridegroom gave her a beautiful bouquet, but forbade her, also, to open the door which he pointed out. Not a whit less curious than her sisters, she, too, opened the forbidden door when the devil had gone hunting, but she had previously put her flowers in water. Then she saw behind the door the fatal abyss and her sisters therein. ""Ah!"" she exclaimed, ""poor creature that I am; I thought I had married an ordinary man, and instead of that he is the devil! How can I get away from him?"" She carefully pulled her two sisters out of hell and hid them. When the devil came home he immediately looked at the bouquet, which she again wore on her bosom, and when he found the flowers so fresh he asked no questions; but reassured as to his secret, he now, for the first time, really loved her. After a few days she asked him if he would carry three chests for her to her parents' house, without putting them down or resting on the way. ""But,"" she added, ""you must keep your word, for I shall be watching you."" The devil promised to do exactly as she wished. So the next morning she put one of her sisters in a chest, and laid it on her husband's shoulders. The devil, who is very strong, but also very lazy and unaccustomed to work, soon got tired of carrying the heavy chest, and wanted to rest before he was out of the street on which he lived; but his wife called out to him, ""Don't put it down; I see you!"" The devil went reluctantly on with the chest until he had turned the corner, and then said to himself, ""She cannot see me here; I will rest a little."" But scarcely had he begun to put the chest down when the sister inside cried out, ""Don't put it down; I see you still!"" Cursing, he dragged the chest on into another street, and was going to lay it down on a doorstep, but he again heard the voice, ""Don't lay it down, you rascal; I see you still!"" ""What kind of eyes must my wife have,"" he thought, ""to see around corners as well as straight ahead, and through walls as if they were made of glass!"" and thus thinking he arrived, all in a perspiration and quite tired out, at the house of his mother-in-law, to whom he hastily delivered the chest, and then hurried home to strengthen himself with a good breakfast. The same thing was repeated the next day with the second chest. On the third day she herself was to be taken home in the chest. She therefore prepared a figure which she dressed in her own clothes, and placed on the balcony, under the pretext of being able to watch him better; slipped quickly into the chest, and had the maid put it on the devil's back. ""The deuce!"" said he; ""this chest is a great deal heavier than the others; and today, when she is sitting on the balcony, I shall have so much the less chance to rest."" So by dint of the greatest exertions he carried it, without stopping, to his mother-in-law, and then hastened home to breakfast, scolding, and with his back almost broken. But quite contrary to custom, his wife did not come out to meet him, and there was no breakfast ready. ""Margerita, where are you?"" he cried, but received no answer. As he was running through the corridors, he at length looked out of a window and saw the figure on the balcony. ""Margerita, have you gone to sleep? Come down. I am as tired as a dog, and as hungry as a wolf."" But there was no reply. ""If you do not come down instantly I will go up and bring you down,"" he cried, angrily; but Margerita did not stir. Enraged, he hastened up to the balcony, and gave her such a box on the ear that her head flew off, and he saw that the head was nothing but a milliner's form, and the body, a bundle of rags. Raging, he rushed down and rummaged through the whole house, but in vain; he found only his wife's empty jewel box. ""Ha!"" he cried; ""she has been stolen from me and her jewels, too!"" and he immediately ran to inform her parents of the misfortune. But when he came near the house, to his great surprise he saw on the balcony above the door all three sisters, his wives, who were looking down on him with scornful laughter. Three wives at once terrified the devil so much that he took his flight with all possible speed. Since that time he has lost his taste for marrying.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (London: Macmillan and Company 1885), no. 16, pp. 78-81.",NA,NA
How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,Peerifool,"The princess was always asking him why he was taking her mother's kale. He was saying to her, if she was not quiet he would take her too. As soon as he had filled his cubby he took her by a leg and an arm and threw her on the top of his cubby of kale and away home he went with her. When he got home he told her what work she had to do; she had to milk the cow and put her up to the hills called Bloodfield, and then she had to take wool, and wash and tease it and comb and card, and spin and make claith [cloth]. When the giant went out she milked the cow and put her to the hills. Then she put on the pot and made porridge to herself. As she was supping it, a great many peerie [little] yellow-headed folk came running, calling out to give them some. She said: When she came to work the wool, none of that work could she do at all. The giant came home at night and found she had not done her work. He took her and began at her head, and peeled the skin off all the way down her back and over her feet. Then he threw her on the couples [rafters] among the hens. The same adventure befell the second girl. If her sister could do little with the wool she could do less. When the giant came home he found her work not done. He began at the crown of her head and peeled a strip of skin all down her back and over her feet, and threw her on the couples beside her sister. They lay there and could not speak nor come down. The next night the youngest princess said she would take a blanket about her and go to watch what had gone away with her sisters. Ere long, in came a giant with a big cubby, and began to cut the kale. She was asking why he was taking her mother's kale. He was saying if she was not quiet he would take her too. He took her by a leg and an arm and threw her on the top of his cubby and carried her away. Next morning he gave her the same work as he had given her sisters. When he was gone out she milked the cow and put her to the high hills. Then she put on the pot and made porridge to herself. When the peerie yellow-headed folk came asking for some she told them to get something to sup with. Some got heather cows and some got broken dishes; some got one thing, and some another, and they all got some of her porridge. After they were all gone a peerie yellow-headed boy came in and asked her if she had any work to do; he could do any work with wool. She said she had plenty, but would never be able to pay him for it. He said all he was asking for it was to tell him his name. She thought that would be easy to do, and gave him the wool. When it was getting dark an old woman came in and asked her for lodging. The princess said she could not give her that, but asked her if she had any news. But the old woman had none, and went away to lie out. There is a high knowe [knoll] near the place, and the old woman sat under it for shelter. She found it very warm. She was always climbing up, and when she came to the top she heard someone inside saying, "" Tease, teasers, tease; card, carders, card; spin, spinners, spin, for Peerie Fool, Peerie Fool is my name."" There was a crack in the knowe, and light coming out. She looked in and saw a great many peerie folk working, and a peerie yellow-headed boy running round them calling out that. The old woman thought she would get lodging if she went to give this news, so she came back and told the princess the whole of it. The princess went on saying ""Peerie Fool, Peerie Fool,"" till the yellow-headed boy came with all the wool made into claith. He asked what was his name, and she guessed names; and he jumped about and said, ""No."" At last she said, ""Peerie Fool is your name."" He threw down the wool and ran off very angry. As the giant was coming home he met a great many peerie yellow-headed folk, some with their eyes hanging on their cheeks, and some with their tongues hanging on their breasts. He asked them what was the matter. They told him it was working so hard pulling wool so fine. He said he had a good wife at home, and if she was safe, never would he allow her to do any work again. When he came home she was all safe, and had a great many webs lying all ready, and he was very kind to her. Next day when he went out she found her sisters, and took them down from the couples. She put the skin on their backs again, and she put her eldest sister in a cazy [basket], and put all the fine things she could find with her, and grass on the top. When the giant came home she asked him to take the cazy to her mother with some food for her cow. He was so pleased with her he would do anything for her, and took it away. Next day she did the same with her other sister. She told him she would have the last of the food she had to send her mother for the cow ready next night. She told him she was going a bit from home, and would leave it ready for him. She got into the cazy with all the fine things she could find, and covered herself with grass. He took the cazy and carried it to the queen's house. She and her daughters had a big boiler of boiling water ready. They couped [overturned] it about him when he was under the window, and that was the end of the giant.",Scotland,"Source: G. F. Black and Northcote W.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Cobbler and His Three Daughters (Blue Beard),"He answers him, ""Even if I shall tell you, I shall get no relief."" ""Yes, yes; who knows? Tell it."" ""I have three daughters, and I have not work enough to maintain them. I have famine in the house."" ""If it is only that, we will manage it. You will give me one of your daughters, and I will give you so much money."" The father was, very grieved to make any such bargain; but at last he comes down to that. He gives him his eldest daughter. This gentleman takes her to his palace, and, after having passed some time there, he said to her that he has a short journey to make -- that he will leave her all the keys, that she might see everything, but that there is one key that she must not make use of -- that it would bring misfortune on her. He locks the door on the young lady. This young girl goes into all the rooms, and finds them very beautiful, and she was curious to see what there was in that which was forbidden. She goes in, and sees heaps of dead bodies. Judge of her fright! With her trembling she lets the key fall upon the ground. She trembles for the coming of her husband. He arrives, and asks her if she has entered the forbidden chamber. She tells him ""Yes."" He takes her and puts her into an underground dungeon; hardly, hardly did he give her enough to eat (to live on), and that was human flesh. This cobbler had finished his money, and he was again melancholy. The gentleman meets him again, and says to him, ""Your other daughter is not happy alone; you must give me another daughter. When she is happy, I will send her back; and I will give you so much money."" The father did not like it; but he was so poor that, in order to have a little money, he gives him his daughter. The gentleman takes her home with him, like the other. After some days he said to her too, ""I must take a short journey. I will give you all the keys of the house, but do not touch such a key of such a room."" He locks the house door, and goes off, after having left her the food she needed. This young girl goes into all the rooms, and, as she was curious, she went to look into the forbidden chamber. She was so terribly frightened at the sight of so many dead bodies in this room, that she lets the key fall, and it gets stained. Our young girl was trembling as to what should become of her when the master should come back. He arrives, and the first thing he asks, ""Have you been in that room?"" She told him ""Yes."" He takes her underground, like her other sister. This cobbler had finished his money, and he was in misery; when the gentleman comes to him again, and says to him, ""I will give you a great deal of money if you will let your daughter come to my house for a few days; the three will be happier together, and I will send you the two back again together."" The father believes it, and gives him his third daughter. The gentleman gives him the money, and he takes this young girl, like the others. At the end of some days he leaves her, saying that he is going to make a short journey. He gives her all the keys of the house, saying to her, ""You will go into all the rooms except this one,"" pointing out the key to her. He locks the outside door, and goes off. This young girl goes straight, straight to the forbidden chamber; she opens it, and think of her horror at seeing so many dead people. She thought that he would kill her too, and, as there were all kinds of arms in this chamber, she takes a sabre with her, and hides it under her dress. She goes a little further on, and sees her two sisters almost dying with hunger, and a young man in the same condition. She takes care of them as well as she can till the gentleman comes home. On his arrival, he asks her, ""Have you been in that room?"" She says, ""Yes;"" and, in giving him back the keys, she lets them fall on the ground, on purpose, and at the instant that this gentleman stoops to pick them up, the young lady cuts off his head (with her sword). Oh, how glad she was! Quickly she runs to deliver her sisters and that young man, who was the son of a king. She sends for her father, the cobbler, and leaves him there with his two daughters, and the youngest daughter goes away with her young gentleman, after being married to him.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Secret Room,"There the bull gave her a large bunch of keys, and told her that she could go anywhere in the house she liked except one room. He showed her the key to this room, and told her that she must not unlock the door to which it belonged. Then the bull went away and left her. The girl took the keys and roamed from one beautiful room to another, until she had seen all except the forbidden room. This she wanted to see more than she had any of the others. At last her curiosity became so great that she opened the door and went inside. What was her horror to discover that the room was full of headless bodies hung on all sides. Quickly she locked the door and ran downstairs. But she had some blood on the key, on her hand, and on her shoes. As she was trying the best she knew how to get the blood off, along came a big black cat, which said to her, ""Mew, mew, mew! Give me a dish of bread and milk, and I will tell you how to get the blood off your shoes."" ""Go away, you old black thing! I am not going to bother with you."" So the cat went away, and pretty soon the bull came. ""Let me see your keys!"" said he. ""How came the blood on this one?"" Then he asked to see her hands and her shoes. When he saw blood on them too, he knew that she had disobeyed him; so, as he had done with all the others who had disobeyed him, he cut her head off and hung her body up with the others in the forbidden room. The next day, when the mother and her two remaining daughters again sat spinning in the sun, they again saw the bull in the cabbage-patch. The mother sent the second daughter just as she had sent the first, and exactly the same things happened to her. The third day the mother and the youngest daughter sat spinning in the sun, when the mother looked up and saw the bull a third time in the cabbage patch. ""Take your distaff and run, child, run!"" cried the mother. So the youngest daughter ran, and the bull ran. The bull ran and she ran until they came to the great house on the edge of the wood. There the bull gave her a bunch of keys, and told her that she might open every door in the house except the one whose key he showed her. Then the bull went away. The youngest daughter did just as her sisters had done, and went into all the rooms except the forbidden one. She kept wondering what could be in there, until her curiosity became so great that she unlocked the door and went in. She, too, was so horrified that she quickly shut the door and ran downstairs, but with the tell-tale blood on the key, on her hand, and on her shoes. To her came the big black cat, who said, ""Mew, mew, mew! Give me a dish of bread and milk, and I will tell you how to get the blood off your shoes."" Instead of telling the cat to go away, as her sisters had done, she went and got some bread and milk for him. When the cat had finished eating, he said, ""If you will go into the attic, you will find there a sickle. Take it, rub it on the key, on your hand, and on your shoes, while you say, 'Blood, be gone! Blood, be gone!""' The girl went to the attic, found the sickle, and did with it as the cat had told her to do, saying, ""Blood, be gone! blood, be gone!"" Even as she spoke the last word, the blood-stains disappeared. Then the girl went downstairs, where she found the bull waiting for her. ""Let me see your keys,"" he said, ""and your hands and your shoes!"" When he saw that she had no blood-stains upon her, he suddenly changed from a bull into a beautiful prince. ""I was bewitched,"" he said, ""by a girl who loved me, but whom I wouldn't marry because I didn't love her. I killed many a girl when I was a bull; but now we will have the bodies taken care of, and then we will be married."" So they buried the bodies, and then were married and lived happily ever after.","New York, USA","Source: Emelyn E.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Three Chests: The Story of the Wicked Old Man of the Sea,"""Ouch! Ouch!"" the farmer cried. ""Let me go!"" Wetehinen only held on more tightly. ""Yes, I'll let you go,"" he said, ""but only on this condition: that you give me one of your daughters for wife!"" ""Give you one of my daughters? Never!"" ""Very well, then I'll never let go!"" wicked old Wetehinen declared and with that he began jerking at the beard as if it were a bell rope. ""Wait! Wait!"" the fanner spluttered. Now he didn't want to give one of his daughters to wicked old Wetehinen -- of course not! But at the same time he was in Wetehinen's power and he realized that if he didn't do what the old reprobate demanded he might lose his life and so leave all three of his daughters orphans. Perhaps for the good of all he had better sacrifice one of them. ""All right,"" he said, ""let me go and I'll send you my oldest daughter. I promise."" So Wetehinen let go his beard and the farmer scrambled to his feet and hurried home. ""My dear,"" he said to his oldest daughter, ""I left a bit of the harness down at the lake. Like a good girl will you run down and get it for me."" The eldest daughter went at once and when she reached the water's edge, old Wetehinen reached up and caught her about the waist and carried her down to the bottom of the lake where he lived in a big house. At first he was kind to her. He made her mistress of the house and gave her the keys to all the rooms and closets. He went very carefully over the keys and pointing to one he said, ""That key you must never use for it opens the door to a room which I forbid you to enter."" The eldest daughter began keeping house for old Wetehinen and spent her time cooking and cleaning and spinning much as she used to at home with her father. The days went by and she grew familiar with the house and began to know what was in every room and every closet. At first she felt no temptation to open the forbidden door. If old Wetehinen wanted to have a secret room, well and good. But why in the world had he given her the key if he really didn't want her to open the door? The more she thought about it the more she wondered. Every time she passed the room she stopped a moment and stared at the door. It looked just exactly like the doors that led into all the other rooms. ""I wonder why he doesn't want me to open just that door?"" she kept asking herself. Finally one day when old Wetehinen was away she thought, ""I don't believe it would matter if I opened that door just a little crack and peeped in once! No one would know the difference!"" For a few moments she hesitated, then mustered up courage enough to turn the key in the forbidden lock and throw open the door. The room was a storeroom with boxes and chests and old jars piled up around the wall. That was unexciting enough, but in the middle of the floor was something that made her start when she saw what it was. It was blood -- that's what it was, a pool of dark red blood! She was about to slam the door shut when she saw something else that made her pause. This was a lovely shining ring that lay in the midst of the pool. ""Oh!"" she thought to herself, ""what a beautiful ring! If I had it I'd wear it on my finger!"" The longer she looked at it, the more she wanted it. ""If I'm very careful,"" she said, ""I know I could reach over and pick it up without touching the blood."" She tiptoed cautiously into the room, wrapped her skirts tightly about her legs, knelt down on the floor, and stretched her arm over the pool. She picked up the ring very carefully but even so she got a few drops of blood on her fingers. ""No matter!"" she thought. ""I can wash that off! And see the lovely ring!"" But later, after she had the door again locked, when she tried to wash the blood off, she found she couldn't. She tried soap, she tried sand, she tried everything she could think of, but without success. ""I don't care!"" she thought to herself. ""If Wetehinen sees the blood, I'll just tell him I cut my finger by accident."" So when Wetehinen came home, she hid the ring and pretended nothing was the matter. After supper Wetehinen put his head in her lap and said, ""Now, my dear, scratch my head and make me drowsy for bed."" She began scratching his head as she had many nights before but, at the first touch of her fingers, he cried out, ""Stop! You're burning my ear! There must be some blood on your fingers! Let me see!"" He reached up and caught her hand and, when he saw the blood stains, he flew into a towering rage. ""I thought so! You've been in the forbidden room!"" He jumped up and without allowing her time to say a word he just cut off her head then and there with no more concern than if she had been a mosquito! After that he took the body and the severed head and threw them into the forbidden room and locked the door. ""Now then,"" he growled, ""she won't disobey me again!"" This was all very well but now he had no one to keep house for him and cook and scratch his head in the evening and soon he decided he'd have to get another wife. He remembered that the farmer had two more daughters, so he thought to himself that now he'd marry the second sister. He waited his chance and one day when the farmer was out in his boat fishing, old Wetehinen came up from the bottom of the lake and clutched the boat. When the poor old farmer tried to row back to shore he couldn't make the boat move an inch. He worked and worked at the oars and wicked old Wetehinen let him struggle until he was exhausted. Then he put his head up out of the water and over the side of the boat and as though nothing were the matter he said, ""Hullo!"" ""Oh!"" the farmer cried, wishing he were safe on shore, ""it's you, is it? I wondered what was holding my boat."" ""Yes,"" wicked old Wetehinen said, ""it's me and I'm going to hold your boat right here on this spot until you promise to give me another of your daughters."" What could the farmer do? He pleaded with Wetehinen but Wetehinen was firm and the upshot was that before the farmer again walked dry land he had promised Wetehinen his second daughter. Well, when he got home, he pretended he had forgotten his ax in the boat and sent his second daughter down to the lake to get it. Wicked old Wetehinen caught her as he had caught her sister and carried her home with him to his house at the bottom of the lake. Wetehinen treated the second sister just exactly as he had the first, making her mistress of the house and telling her she might use every key but one. Like her sister she, too, after a time gave way to the temptation of looking into the forbidden room and when she saw the shining ring lying in the pool of blood of course she wanted it and of course when she reached to get it she dabbled her fingers in the blood. So that was the end of her, too, for wicked old Wetehinen when he saw the blood stains just cut her head right off and threw her body and the severed head into the forbidden room beside the body and head of her sister and locked the door. Time went by and the farmer was living happily with his youngest daughter when one day while he was out chopping wood he found a pair of fine birch bark brogues. He put them on and instantly found himself, walking away from the woods and down to the lake. He tried to stop but he couldn't. He tried to walk in another direction but the brogues carried him straight down to the water's edge and out into the lake until he was in waist deep. Then he heard a gruff voice saying, ""Hullo, there! What are you doing with my brogues?"" Of course it was wicked old Wetehinen who had played that trick to get the farmer into his power again. ""What do you want this time?"" the poor farmer cried. ""I want your youngest daughter,"" Wetehinen said. ""What! My youngest daughter!"" ""Yes."" ""I won't give her up!"" the farmer declared. ""I don't care what you do to me. I won't give her up!"" ""Oh, very well!"" Wetehinen said, and immediately the brogues which had been standing still while they talked started walking again. They carried the farmer out into the lake farther and farther until the water was up to his chin. ""Wait -- wait a minute!"" he cried. The brogues stopped walking and Wetehinen said, ""Well, do you promise to give her to me?"" ""No!"" the farmer began. ""She's my last daughter and -- "" Before he could say more, the brogues walked on and the water rose to his nose. In desperation he threw up his hands and shouted, ""I promise! I promise!"" So when he got home that day he said to his youngest daughter whose name was Lisa, ""Lisa, my dear, I forgot my brogues at the lake. Like a good girl won't you run and get them for me?"" So Lisa went to the lake and Wetehinen of course caught her and carried her down to his house as he had her two sisters. Then the same old story was repeated. Wetehinen made Lisa mistress of the house and gave her keys to all the doors and closets with the same prohibition against opening the door of the forbidden room. ""If I am mistress of the house,"" Lisa said to herself, ""why should I not unlock every door?"" She waited until one day when Wetehinen was away from home, then went boldly to the forbidden room, fitted the key in the lock, and flung open the door. There lay her two poor sisters with their heads cut off. There in the pool of blood sparkled the lovely ring, but Lisa paid no heed to it. ""Wicked old Wetehinen!"" Lisa cried. ""I suppose he thinks that ring will tempt me, but nothing will tempt me to touch that awful blood!"" Then she rummaged about, opening boxes and chests, and turning things over. In a dark corner she found two pitchers, one marked Water of Life, the other Water of Death. ""Ha! This is what I want!"" she cried, taking the pitcher of the Water of Life. She set the severed heads of her sisters in place and then with the magic water brought them back to life. She used up all the Water of Life, so she filled the pitcher marked Water of Life with the water from the other pitcher, the Water of Death. She hid her sisters each in a big wooden chest, she shut and locked the door of the forbidden room, and Wetehinen when he came home found her working at her spinning wheel as though nothing unusual had happened. After supper Wetehinen said, ""Now scratch my head and make me drowsy for bed."" So Lisa scratched his wicked old head and she did it so well that he grunted with satisfaction. ""Uh! Uh!"" he said. ""That's good! Now just behind my right ear! That's it! That's it! You're a good girl, you are! You're not like some of them who do what they're told not to do! Now behind the other ear! Oh, that's fine! Yes, you're a good girl, and if there's anything you want me to do just tell me what it is."" ""I want to send a chest of things to my poor old father,"" Lisa said. ""Just a lot of little nothings -- odds and ends that I've picked up about the house. I'd be ashamed to have you open the chest and see them. I do wish you'd carry the chest ashore tomorrow and leave it where my father will find it."" ""All right, I will,"" Wetehinen promised. He was true to his word. The next morning he hoisted one of the chests on his shoulder, the one that had in it the eldest sister. He trudged off with it, and tossed it up on shore at a place where he was sure the farmer would find it. Lisa then wheedled him into carrying up the second chest that had in it the second sister. This time Wetehinen wasn't so good-natured. ""I don't know what she can always be sending her father!"" he grumbled. ""If she sends another chest I'll have to look inside and see."" Now Lisa, when the second sister was safely delivered, began to plan her own escape. She pulled out another empty chest and then one evening after she had succeeded in making old Wetehinen comfortable and drowsy she begged him to carry this also to her father. He grumbled and protested but finally promised. ""And you won't look inside, will you? Promise me you won't!"" Lisa begged. Wetehinen said he wouldn't, but he intended to just the same. Well, the next morning as soon as Wetehinen went out, Lisa took the churn and dressed it up in some of her own clothes. She carried it to the top of the house and perched it on the ridge of the roof before a spinning wheel. Then she herself crept inside the third chest and waited. When Wetehinen came home he looked up and saw what he thought was Lisa spinning on the roof. ""Hullo!"" he shouted. ""What are you doing up there?"" Lisa, in the chest, answered in a voice that sounded as if it came from the roof: ""I'm spinning. And you, Wetehinen, my dear, don't forget the chest that you promised to carry to my poor old father. It's standing in the kitchen."" Wetehinen grumbled but because of his promise he hoisted the chest on his shoulder and started off. When he had gone a little way he thought to put it down and take a peep inside. Instantly Lisa's voice, sounding as if it came from the roof, cried out, ""No! No! You promised not to look inside!"" ""I'm not looking inside!"" Wetehinen called back. ""I'm only resting a minute!"" Then he thought to himself, ""I suppose she's sitting up there so she can watch me!"" When he had gone some distance farther, he thought again to set down the chest and open the lid but instantly Lisa's voice, as from a long way off, called out: ""No! No! You promised not to look inside!"" ""Who's looking inside?"" he called back, pretending again he was only resting. Every time he thought it would be safe to put down the chest and open the lid, Lisa's voice cried out: ""No! No! You promised not to !"" ""Mercy on us!"" old Wetehinen fumed to himself, ""who would have thought she could see so far!"" On the shore of the lake when he threw down the chest in disgust he tried one last time to raise the lid. Instantly Lisa's voice cried out: ""No! No! You promised not to!"" ""I'm not looking inside!"" Wetehinen roared, and in a fury he left the chest and started back into the water. All the way home He grumbled and growled, ""A nice way to treat a man, always making him carry chests! I won't carry another one no matter how much she begs me!"" When he came neat home he saw the spinning wheel still on the roof and the figure still seated before it. ""Why haven't you got my dinner ready?"" he called out angrily. The figure at the spinning wheel made no answer. ""What's the matter with you?"" Wetehinen cried. ""Why are you sitting there like a wooden image instead of cooking my dinner?"" Still the figure made no answer and in a rage Wetehinen began climbing up the roof. He reached out blindly and clutched at Lisa's skirt and jerked it so hard that the churn came clattering down on his head. It knocked him off the roof and he fell all the way to the ground and cracked his wicked old head wide open. ""Ouch! Ouch!"" he roared in pain. ""Just wait till I get hold of that Lisa!"" He crawled to the forbidden room and poured over himself the water that was in the pitcher marked Water of Life. But it wasn't the Water of Life at all, it was the Water of Death, and so it didn't help his wicked old cracked head at all. In fact it just made it worse and worse and worse. Lisa and her sisters were never again troubled by him nor was any one else that lived on the shores of that lake. ""Wonder what's become of wicked old Wetehinen?"" people began saying.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Three Sisters Who Were Taken into the Mountain,"Once upon a time there was an old widow who lived, with her three daughters, far away from the rest of the world, next to a mountain. She was so poor that her only animal was a single hen, which she prized as the apple of her eye. It was always cackling at her heels, and she was always running to look after it. One day, all at once, the hen was gone. The old woman went out, and walked around and around the cottage, looking and calling for her hen, but it was gone, and could not be found. So the woman said to her oldest daughter, ""You must just go out and see if you can find our hen, for we must have it back, even if we have to fetch it out of the mountain."" The daughter was ready enough to go, so she set off and walked up and down, and looked and called, but she could not find the hen. Suddenly, just as she was about to give up the hunt, she heard someone calling out from a cleft in the rock: So she went into the cleft to see what it was, but she had barely set foot inside, when she fell through a trapdoor, deep, deep down, into an underground cavern. When she got to the bottom she went through many rooms, each finer than the one before it; but in the innermost room of all, a large ugly troll came to her and asked, ""Will you be my sweetheart?"" ""No! I will not,"" she said. She wouldn't have him for any price! All she wanted was to get above ground again as fast as ever she could, and to find her lost hen. Then the troll got so angry that he picked her up, twisted her head off, and then threw both the head and body into the cellar. While this was going on, her mother sat at home waiting and waiting, but no daughter came. After she had waited a bit longer, and neither heard nor saw anything of her daughter, she told her middle daughter to go out and look for her sister, and, she added, ""Give our hen a call at the same time."" So the second sister had to set off, and the very same thing happened to her. She was looking and calling, and suddenly she too heard a voice calling from from the cleft in the rock: She thought that this was strange, and went to see what it was. She too fell through the trapdoor, deep, deep down, into the cavern. She too went from room to room, and in the innermost one the troll came to her and asked if she would be his sweetheart? No, she would not. All she wanted was to get above ground again, and hunt for her lost hen. The troll got angry, and picked her up, twisted her head off, and threw both head and body into the cellar. Now, when the old woman had sat and waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her second daughter, and could neither see nor hear anything of her, she said to the youngest, ""Now, you must go out and look for your sisters. It was silly to lose the hen, but it would be sillier still to lose both your sisters. Of course, you can give the hen a call at the same time."" You see, the old woman's heart was still set on her hen. Yes, the youngest was ready to go, and she walked up and down, hunting for her sisters and calling the hen, but she could neither see nor hear anything of them. She too came to the cleft in the rock, and heard something say: She thought that this was strange, so she too went to see what it was, and she too fell through the trapdoor, deep, deep down, into a cavern. When she reached the bottom she went from one room to another, each grander than the one before it; but she wasn't at all afraid, and took time to look carefully about her. As she was peeping into this and that, she saw the trapdoor into the cellar, and looked down it, and what should she see there but her dead sisters. She barely had time to slam to the trapdoor before the troll came to her and asked, ""Will you be my sweetheart?"" ""With all my heart,"" answered the girl, for she saw very well how it had gone with her sisters. When the troll heard that, he brought her the finest clothes in the world. Indeed, she had only to ask, and she got whatever she wanted, because the troll was so glad that someone would be his sweetheart. One day, after she had been there a little while, she was looking very gloomy and downcast, so the troll asked her what was the matter, and why she was so sad. ""Ah!"" said the girl, ""it's because I can't get home to my mother. I know that she has very little to eat and drink, and she has no one with her."" ""Well!"" said the troll, ""I can't let you go to see her; but just stuff some meat and drink into a sack, and I'll carry it to her."" With many thanks, she said that she would do that. However, she put a lot of gold and silver into the bottom of the sack, then laid a little food on top. She told the ogre the sack was ready, but that he must be sure not to look into it. He gave his word not to look inside, and set off. As the troll walked off, she peeped out at him through a chink in the trapdoor. When he had gone a little way, he said, ""This sack is very heavy. I'll just see what is inside."" He was about to untie the the sack, when the girl called out to him, ""I can still see you! I can still see you!"" ""The devil you can!"" said the troll; ""you must have mighty sharp eyes!"" And the troll did not try to look into it again. When he reached the widow's cottage, he threw the sack in through the cottage door, saying, ""Here you have meat and drink from your daughter; she doesn't want for anything."" After the girl had been in the mountain a good bit longer, one day a billy goat fell down the trapdoor. ""Who sent for you, you long bearded beast!"" said the troll, in an awful rage, and he picked up the goat, twisted his head off, and threw him into the cellar. ""Oh!"" said the girl, ""why did you do that? I might have had the goat to play with down here."" ""Well!"" said the troll, ""you don't need to be so down in the mouth about it. I can bring the billy goat back to life again."" So saying, he took down a flask that was hanging on the wall, put the billy goat's head on his body again, and smeared it with some ointment from flask, and he was as well and as lively as before. ""Aha!"" said the girl to herself; ""that flask is worth something -- that it is."" When she had been in the mountain some time longer, on a day when the troll was away, she took her oldest sister, put her head on her shoulders, smeared her with some of the ointment from the flask, just as she had seen the troll do with the billy goat, and in an instant her sister came to life again. The girl stuffed her into a sack, laid a little food over her, and when the troll came home, she said to him, ""Dear friend! Now do go home to my mother with a morsel of food again. I'm certain that the poor thing is both hungry and thirsty, and besides that, she's all alone in the world. But you must not look into the sack."" He said that he would carry the sack, and that he would not look into it. But when he had gone a little way, he thought that the sack was getting very heavy; and when he had gone a bit further he said to himself, ""Come what will, I must see what's inside this sack, for however sharp her eyes may be, she can't see me all this way off."" But just as he was about to untie the sack, the girl inside the sack called out, ""I can still see you! I can still see you!"" ""The devil you can!"" said the ogre; ""then you must have mighty sharp eyes,"" for he thought it was the girl inside the mountain who was speaking. So he didn't dare so much as to peep into the sack again, but carried it straight to her mother as fast as he could, and when he got to the cottage door he threw it in through the door, and cried out, ""Here you have meat and drink from your daughter; she wants for nothing."" When the girl had been in the mountain a while longer, she did the very same thing with her other sister. She put her head on her shoulders, smeared her with ointment from the flask, brought her to life, and put her into the sack. This time she crammed in also as much gold and silver as the sack would hold, laying just a little food on top. ""Dear friend,"" she said to the troll, ""you really must run home to my mother with a little food again; and don't look into the sack."" Yes, the troll was eager to do as she wished, and he gave his word too that he wouldn't look into the sack; but when he had gone a little way he began to think that the sack was getting very heavy, and when he had gone a bit further, he could scarce stagger along under it, so he set it down, and was just about to untie the string and look into it, when the girl inside the sack cried out, ""I can still see you! I can still see you!"" ""The devil you can,"" said the troll, ""then you must have mighty sharp eyes."" Well, he did not dare to try to look into the sack, but hurried straight to the girl's mother. When he got to the cottage he threw the sack in through the door, and roared out, ""Here you have food from your daughter; she wants for nothing!"" After the girl had been there a good while longer, on a day when the troll had decided to go out for the day, the girl pretended to be sick. She moaned and complained. ""There's no need for you to come home before twelve o'clock tonight,"" she said, ""for I won't be able to have supper ready before then. I'm just too sick!"" As soon as the troll was out of the house, she stuffed some of her clothes with straw, and stood this straw girl in the corner by the chimney, with a broom in her hand, so that it looked just as though she herself were standing there. After that she stole off home, and got a marksman to stay in the cottage with her mother. So when the clock struck twelve, or thereabouts, the troll came home, and the first thing he said to the straw girl was, ""Give me something to eat."" But she did not answer him. ""Give me something to eat, I say!"" called out the troll, ""for I am almost starved."" But she did not have a word for him. ""Give me something to eat!"" roared out the ogre the third time. ""I think you'd better open your ears and hear what I say, or else I'll wake you up, I will!"" But the girl stood just as still as ever; so he flew into a rage, and gave her such a slap in the face, that the straw flew all about the room. When he saw that he had been tricked, he began to hunt everywhere. When he came to the cellar, and found both the girl's sisters missing, he soon figured out what had happened, and ran off to the cottage, saying, ""I'll soon pay her for this!"" But when he reached the cottage, the marksman fired off his piece. The troll did not dare go into the house, for he thought it was thunder [Thor]. So he set off for home again as fast as he could run; but just as he reached the trapdoor, the sun rose and he exploded. There's a lot of gold and silver down there still, if you only knew where the trapdoor is!",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Popular Tales from the Norse, translated by George Webbe Dasent (New York: D.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Tiger's Bride,"After she had called out this a few times, a tiger suddenly appeared and asked what she wanted; she explained her difficulty and the tiger undertook to lift the load on to her head, if she would really give him her daughter in marriage. She promised and with the help of the tiger took up the bundle and went home. Two or three days after, the tiger presented himself at her house and was duly married to the daughter. After the wedding the couple started for the tiger's home; all the way the unhappy bride wept und sang: ""How far off is our home, big head?"" ""You can just see the mouth of the cave,"" answered the tiger and in a short time they came to a large cave. Then the tiger told her to set to work and cook a feast while he went off and invited his friends to come and share it.

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,The Widow and Her Daughters,"There was a great gray horse who was coming every day to the yard to eat the kail. Said the eldest of the daughters to her mother, ""I will go to the yard today, and I will take the spinning-wheel with me, and I will keep the horse out of the kail."" ""Do,"" said her mother. She went out. The horse came; she took the distaff from the wheel and she struck him. The distaff stuck to the horse, and her hand stuck to the distaff. Away went the horse till they reached a green hill, and he called out, ""Open, open, oh green hill, and let in the king's son; open, open, oh green hill, and let in the widow's daughter."" The hill opened, and they went in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and she lay down that night. Early on the morrow, when he rose, he was going to hunt. He gave her the keys of the whole house, and he said to her that she might open every chamber inside but the one. ""By all she ever saw not to open that one."" That she should have his dinner ready when he should come back, and that if she would be a good woman that he would marry her. When he went away she began to open the chambers. Every one, as she opened it, was getting finer and finer, till she came to the one that was forbidden. It seemed to her, ""What might be in it that she might not open it too."" She opened it, and it was full of dead gentlewomen, and she went down to the knee in blood. Then she came out, and she was cleaning her foot; and though she were cleaning it, still she could not take a bit of the blood off it. A tiny cat came where she was, and she said to her, ""If she would give a little drop of milk that she would clean her foot as well as it was before. ""Thou! Ugly beast! Be off before thee. Dost thou suppose that I won't clean them better than thou?"" ""Yes, yes, take thine own way. Thou wilt see what will happen to thee when himself comes home."" He came home, and she set the dinner on the board, and they sat down at it. Before they ate a bit he said to her, ""Wert thou a good woman today?"" ""I was,"" said she. ""Let me see thy foot, and I will tell thee whether thou wert or wert not."" She let him see the one that was clean. ""Let me see the other one,"" said he. When he saw the blood, ""Oh! ho!"" said he. He rose and took the axe and took her head off, and he threw her into the chamber with the other dead people. He laid down that night, and early on the morrow he went to the widow's yard again. Said the second one of the widow's daughters to her mother, ""I will go out today, and I will keep the gray horse out of the yard."" She went out sewing. She struck the thing she was sewing on the horse. The cloth stuck to the horse, and her hand stuck to the cloth. They reached the hill. He called as usual to the hill; the hill opened, and they went in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and they lay down that night. Early in the morning he was going to hunt, and he said to her that she should open every chamber inside but one, and ""by all she ever saw"" not to open that one. She opened every chamber till she came to the little one, and because she thought, ""What might be in that one more than the rest that she might not open it?"" She opened it, and it was full of dead gentlewomen, and her own sister amongst them. She went down to the knee in blood. She came out, and she was cleaning herself, and the little cat came round about, and she said to her, ""If thou wilt give me a tiny drop of milk I will clean thy foot as well as it over was."" "" Thou! Ugly beast! Begone. Dost thou think that I will not clean it myself better than thou?"" ""Thou wilt see,"" said the cat, ""what will happen to thee when himself comes home."" When he came she set down the dinner, and they sat at it. Said he, ""Wert thou a good woman today?"" ""I was,"" said she. ""Let me see thy foot, and I will tell thee whether thou wert or wert not."" She let him see the foot that was clean. "" Let me see the other one,"" said he. She let him see it. ""Oh! ho!"" said he, and he took the axe and took her head off. He lay down that night. Early on the morrow, said the youngest one to her mother, as she wove a stocking, ""I will go out with my stocking today, and I will watch the gray horse. I will see what happened to my two sisters, and I will return to tell you."" ""Do,"" said her mother, ""and see thou dost not stay away."" She went out, and the horse came. She struck the stocking on the horse. The stocking stuck to the horse, and the band stuck to the stocking. They went away, and they reached the green hill. He called out as usual, and they got in. He warmed water for her feet, and made a soft bed for her limbs, and they lay down that night. On the morrow he was going to hunt, and he said to her, ""If she would behave herself as a good woman till he returned, that they would be married in a few days."" He gave her the keys, and he said to her that she might open every chamber that was within but that little one, ""but see that she should not open that one."" She opened every one, and when she came to this one, because she thought, ""what might be in it that she might not open it more than the rest?"" She opened it, and she saw her two sisters there dead, and she went down to the two knees in blood. She came out, and she was cleaning her feet, and she could not take a bit of the blood off them. The tiny cat came where she was, and she said to her, ""Give me a tiny drop of milk, and I will clean thy feet as well as they were before."" ""I will give it, thou creature; I will give thee thy desire of milk if thou will clean my feet"" The cat licked her feet as well as they were before. Then the king came home, and they set down his dinner, and they sat at it Before they ate a bit, he said, to her, ""Wert thou a good woman today?"" ""I was middling,"" said she; I have no boasting to make of myself."" ""Let me see thy feet,"" said he. She let him see her feet. ""Thou wert a good woman,"" said he; ""and if thou holdest on thus till the end of a few days, thyself and I will be married."" On the morrow he went away to hunt. When he went away the little cat came where she was. ""Now, I will tell thee in what way thou wilt be quickest married to him,"" said the cat. ""There are,"" said she, ""a lot of old chests within. Thou shall take out three of them; thou shalt clean them. Thou shalt say to him next night, that he must leave these three chests, one about of them, in thy mother's house, as they are of no use here; that there are plenty here without them; thou shalt say to him that he must not open any of them on the road, or else, if he opens, that thou wilt leave him; that thou wilt go up into a tree top, and that thou wilt be looking, and that if he opens any of them that thou wilt see. Then when he goes hunting, thou shalt open the chamber, thou shalt bring out thy two sisters; thou shalt draw on them the magic club, and they will be as lively and whole as they were before; thou shalt clean them then, and thou shall put one in each chest of them, and thou shalt go thyself into the third one. Thou shalt put of silver and of gold, as much in the chests as will keep thy mother and thy sisters right for their lives. When he leaves the chests in thy mother's house, and when he returns he will fly in a wild rage; he will then go to thy mother's house in this fury, and he will break in the door; be thou behind the door, and take off his head with the bar; and then he will be a king's son, as precious as he was before, and he will marry thee. Say to thy sisters, if he attempts the chests to open them by the way, to call out, 'I see thee, I see thee,' and that he will think that thou wilt be calling out in the tree."" When he came home he went away with the chests, one after one, till he left them in her mother's house. When he came to a glen, where he thought she in the tree could not see him, he began to let the chest down to see what was in it; she that was in the chest called out, ""I see thee, I see thee!"" "" Good luck be on thy pretty little head,"" said he, "" if thou canst not see a long way!"" This was the way with him each journey, till he left the chests altogether in her mother's house. When he returned home on the last journey, and saw that she was not before him, he flew in a wild rage; he went back to the widow's house, and when he reached the door he drove it in before him. She was standing behind the door, and she took his head off with the bar. Then he grew a king's son, as precious as ever came; there he was within, and they were in great gladness. She and himself married, and they left with her mother and sisters, of gold and silver, as much as left them well for life.",Scotland,"Source: John Francis Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands: Orally Collected, vol. 2 (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1860), pp. 265-70.","Campbell's source: ""From Mrs. MacGeachy, Farmer's Wife, Islay.""

How the Devil Married Three Sisters,0311,Zerendac,"When the woodcutter went home at dusk, he boasted of the bargain to his wife, and next morning, took the girl to a certain cave and there gave her over to the stranger, who said that his name was Abu Freywar. As soon as the woodman was gone, Abu Freywar said to her, ""You must be hungry, eat these."" So saying, he took a knife and cut off both his ears, which he gave to her together with a nasty-looking loaf of black bread. The girl refusing such food, he hung her up by the hair from the ceiling of a chamber in the cave, which had meanwhile become a magnificent palace. Next day, Abu Freywar went again to the forest and found the woodcutter. ""I want your second daughter for my brother,"" he said. ""Here is the money. Bring her to the cave tomorrow."" The woodcutter, delighted at his great good fortune, brought his second daughter to Abu Freywar, and directly he had gone, Abu Freywar gave the girl his ears, which had grown afresh, to eat. She said she was not hungry just then, but would keep them to eat by-and-by. When he went out of the room, she tried to deceive him by hiding his ears under a carpet on the floor. When he returned and asked if she had eaten them, she said ""Yes."" But he called out, ""Ears of mine, are you hot or cold? ""and they answered promptly, ""Cold as ice, and lying under the carpet."" Whereupon Abu Freywar, in a rage hung her up beside her sister. He then went and asked for the youngest daughter, whose name was Zerendac, saying, that he wanted her for another brother. But the girl, a spoilt child, refused to go unless she might take with her a pet kitten and a box in which she kept her treasures. Hugging those, she went with Abu Freywar to the cave. She proved wiser than her sisters. When her husband's back was turned, she gave his ears to the cat which devoured them eagerly, while she ate some food which she had brought from home. When the ogre returned and cried as of wont, ""Ears of mine, are you hot or cold?"" He received the answer, ""As hot as can be in this snug little stomach,"" and this pleased him so that from that time he began to grow very fond of Zerendac. After she had lived some days with him, he said, ""I must go on a journey. There are forty rooms in this palace. Here are the keys, with which you may open any door you please except that to which this golden key belongs,"" and with that he took his departure. Zerendac amused herself in his absence with opening and examining the locked- up rooms. On entering the thirty-ninth, she happened to look out of the window which opened on to a burial ground, and was terrified to see her husband, who was a ghoul, devouring a corpse that he had just dug out of a grave with his long claw- like nails. She was so fascinated with the sight that (hidden behind the window curtain), she watched him at his horrible repast. A few minutes later she saw him start and hide himself behind a monument in the cemetery. He had been disturbed by the approach of a funeral. As the procession approached she heard one of the bearers say, ""Let us be off as soon as possible, lest the ghoul which haunts this place get hold of us,"" and she could see that the whole company seemed very anxious. This discovery caused the girl great uneasiness. She was anxious to know what was in the fortieth room, and the discovery she had made as to the real character of her husband prompted her to solve the mystery at any cost. She took the golden key and opened the door. She found her two sisters still alive and dangling from the ceiling by their hair. She cut them down, fed them, and as soon as their health was restored, sent them back to her parents. Abu Freywar returned next day, but not for long. He left home a few days later, telling his wife she might invite any of her relations whom she cared to see. Accordingly she invited many of her friends and relatives, who came to see her, but heard nothing of her troubles. It was well for her that she did not complain, for her visitors were not the persons they seemed to be, but simply her husband in various shapes assumed in order to entrap her. He succeeded at last in the form of her grandmother to whom she was beginning to tell all her sorrows; when the old woman became Abu Freywar and, taking a poisoned nail, drove it into her breast. The wound did not kill her, but it caused her to swoon away. No sooner was she unconscious than the monster put her into a chest and sank it in the sea. Now the son of the sultan of that land was fond of boating and fishing, and this prince happened to cast a large net from a boat close to the place where the chest in which she was lay at the bottom of the sea. The net, happening to enclose the chest, was hauled in with the greatest difficulty. The sultan's son had it drawn into the boat, and, before opening it, said to his attendants, ""If it contains money or jewels, you may have them all; but should it contain anything else, it is mine."" He was greatly shocked when he saw its actual contents, and mourned the sad fate of that lovely girl. He had her body carried to his mother's chamber, to be honorably prepared for burial. During the process, the nail being found and removed, Zerendac sneezed and came to life again. She married the prince, and in course of time bore him a daughter. But one day, when she was alone with the child, the wall of her room suddenly split open, and Abu Freywar appeared. Without a word to the mother, he snatched up the infant and swallowed it, disappearing as suddenly as he had come. Zerendac was so bewildered by this fresh misfortune that, when asked where the baby had gone, she could only weep despairingly. Her second child, a son, and the third, another daughter, were torn from her in the same horrible manner. On this last occasion, the cruel ogre smeared the poor mother's face with her child's blood. She washed it off, but, in her hurry and anguish, missed a slight stain beneath her under lip. Her husband and her mother-in-law, already very suspicious, judged of course that she was a ghoul and had devoured her offspring. Zerendac told her story, but no one would believe it. Her husband, being loth to put her to death, ordered her to be imprisoned in a small underground chamber, and, at his mother's suggestion, sought another bride. Hearing of the beauty of the daughter of a neighboring sultan, he went to ask for her. But before setting out he sent for the mother of his lost children, and asked her what she would like him to bring her when he came back. She asked for a box of aloes [Arabic sebr, also meaning ""patience""], for a box of henna [the same word means ""tenderness""], and a dagger. Her request was granted, and when the prince returned from his betrothal to the sultan's daughter, he brought with him these things for Zerendac. She opened the boxes, one by one, saying, ""O box of sebr, you have not in you more patience than I have shown. O box of henna, you cannot be gentler than I have been,"" and was just going to stab herself with the dagger, when the wall of her prison opened and Abu Frey war appeared, leading a handsome boy and two lovely girls. ""Live!"" he cried, ""I have not killed your children. Here they are."" He then by his magic made a secret staircase connecting her dungeon with the great hall of the palace. Having done this, he seized the dagger and slew himself. When the festivities in connection with the prince's marriage began, Zerendac sent the three children, richly dressed in clothes which Abu Freywar had left with her, up the staircase, telling them to amuse themselves without respect for the guests or the furniture. Accordingly they did all the damage they could think of; but the mother of the prince was slow to punish them, because they were pretty, and reminded her of her son at their age. But at last, losing patience, she was going to strike one of them when they all shouted at once, ""Ya sitt Ubdûr, shun keyf el kamr btadûr,"" which means, ""O Lady Full-Moon, look how the moon is turning round."" Everyone rushed to the window, and while their backs were turned the children vanished. On the actual wedding day the children appeared again when their father was present, ran about, breaking china and glass, and did all the damage they could think of. The prince forbade them. They replied haughtily, ""This is our house, and everything here belongs to us and to our parents."" ""What do you mean by that?"" inquired the prince. The children answered by leading their father down the secret staircase to Zerendac, who explained who they really were and how they came there. The prince, greatly moved, embraced her tenderly and swore to be true to her till his life's end. The sultan's daughter was returned, with excuses and a satisfactory present, to her father; and the prince and Zerendac lived happy ever after.",Palestine,"Source: J. E.

The Devil (or Ogre) and the Gun,1157,How the Devil Played the Flute,"They came to a large oak tree where a man in a green jacket and with a green cap was lying asleep. A bag was hanging next to him from the tree, from which were protruding all kinds of game: hares, woodcocks, and wild ducks. Next to the bag there was a gun. The little devil ran up and examined everything closely. Picking up the gun, he asked his father what it was. The old devil wrinkled his forehead and said, ""That is a flute, my son. When people play on it, wild animals run up to them, and they only have to catch them."" ""That I have to see,"" said the little devil. ""You should play something for me on it."" ""It takes two, my son. One to blow and one to finger."" ""Then you can blow, and I will finger,"" said the whippersnapper. So the old one had to put the barrel into his mouth, whether he wanted to or not, because he had spoiled the little fellow rotten. The old one blew, and the whippersnapper fingered and fingered, but not a single tone came out. ""You have to press down on the keys, you stupid boy,"" said the old one. The little devil pushed against the hammer, then there came such a blow that the old one was struck to the ground, for the entire load of shot hit him in the throat. The young one ran away, terrified. The old one soon recovered and ran after his boy, for the sound of the gun had awakened the man. ""That was not a beautiful tone,"" said the whippersnapper. ""You pressed the wrong key,"" said the old one, ""and the flute was dusty, so all the dust flew into my throat.""",Germany,"Source: Johann Wilhelm Wolf, ""Wie der Teufel auf der Flöte blies,"" Deutsche Hausmärchen (Göttingen: Dieterich'sche Buchhandlung, 1851), pp. 438-39.",NA,Translated by D.

The Devil (or Ogre) and the Gun,1157,The Origin of the Jack-o'-Lantern,"One morning Sion was on his way to Llanfair-Fechan, carrying a flail on his shoulder, for he had corn there, when whom should he meet but his old friend from the pit, with a bag on his back, and in it two little devils like himself. After conversing for some time they began to quarrel, and presently were in the midst of a terrible fight. Sion fell to basting the devils with his flail, until the bag containing the two little ones went all to pieces, and the two tumbling out, fled for their lives to Rhiwgyfylchi, which village is considered to this day a very wicked place from this fact. Sion then went his way rejoicing, and did not for a long time encounter his adversary. Eventually, however, they met, and this time Sion had his gun on his shoulder. ""What's that long thing you're carrying?"" inquired the devil. ""That's my pipe,"" said Sion. Then the devil asked, ""Shall I have a whiff out of it?"" ""You shall,"" was Sion's reply, and he placed the mouth of his gun in the devil's throat and drew the trigger. Well; that was the loudest report from a gun that was ever heard on this earth. ""Ach!-tw!-tw!"" exclaimed the smoker, ""your pipe is very foul,"" and he disappeared in a flame. After a lapse of time, Sion met him again in the guise of a gentleman, but the Welshman knew it was the tempter. This time he made a bargain for which he was ever afterwards sorry, i.e., he sold himself to the devil for a sum down, but with the understanding that whenever he could cling to something the devil should not then control him. One day when Sion was busily gardening, the evil one snatched him away into the air without warning, and Sion was about giving up all hopes of again returning to earth, when he thought to himself, ""I'll ask the devil one last favor."" The stupid devil listened. ""All I want is an apple,"" said Sion, ""to moisten my lips a bit down below; let me go to the top of my apple tree, and I'll pick one."" ""Is that all?"" quoth the diawl, and consented. Of course Sion laid hold of the apple tree, and hung on. The devil had to leave him there. But the old reprobate was too wicked for heaven, and the devil having failed to take him to the other place, he was turned into a fairy, and is now the jack-o'- lantern. Return to D. L.

Straightening a Curly Hair,1175,Tapai and the Brahman,"He came near, and feeling the genial influence of the flame from afar, incautiously shouted ""Tapai, tapai,"" meaning ""I am warmed, I am warmed."" Alas, the creatures round the fire were maleficent ghosts, hideous, distorted, grinning, sworn enemies of mankind, shouting obscene words with the nasal utterance which marks their race. Moreover, one of them was named Tapai, and the ghostly assemblage were mightily vexed at a mortal's familiar use of their comrade's name. They threatened him with instant death. The Brahman, in terror, felt for his sacred thread, but it had slipped down. He strove to repeat the holy names of the gods, but his memory was paralyzed with fear. But finally the thread came into his hand, and taking heart, he boldly asserted that he knew Tapai quite well, seeing that Tapai and his ancestors for three generations had been the slaves of his family. ""Well,"" cried Tapai, ""if he can tell me the names of my ancestors, I will become his bond servant."" To which the keen-witted priest replied, ""How can I be expected to know the names of all the slaves of my ancestors? But I have them recorded in a ledger at home."" On which he was allowed to depart on condition that he returned on the third day to answer to Tapai's challenge. Otherwise not only he but his family would perish at the hands of the man-eating bhutas. The Brahman went home, saved for the moment, indeed, but filled with despair for the future. For two miserable days the wretched priest could neither eat nor sleep, and his wife and daughter and infant son shared his anxiety. The third night, when his family slept, the miserable man went forth to hang himself in the jungle rather than face his ghostly foes. But on the very tree he chose for his suicide were two dark forms. He shuddered, he stood still, but he listened. It was Tapai and his wife, and the latter, with true feminine curiosity, was asking her husband the names of his forebears. Of course Tapai had to tell, as every husband does when his wife presses him. He recited the following verse: Such was the verse which the Brahman committed to memory, and groping his way home through the dark forest, faced life with a new confidence. Next evening he went to the ghostly rendezvous, and the unlucky Tapai followed him home, his submissive slave. But there was one condition. Tapai would perform all tasks given to him from dawn till nightfall. But he must be kept occupied all the time. At first the condition seemed easy to fulfil. The bhuta was ordered to build a palace, raise a noble temple, dig a tank, procure a bridegroom for the Brahman's daughter, etc., etc. But there are limits to human desires and human inventiveness, and even the Brahman was, in spite of all the luxury with which he was now surrounded, a harassed and perplexed mortal. He was like to die of sheer worry and anxious thought, when his wife came to his rescue. She plucked a curly hair from her husband's eyebrow. ""Give that to the creature,"" she said, ""and tell him to straighten it."" The poor demon, for once, was at his wit's end. He pulled the hair, and pressed it, and wetted it. But all in vain. The moment it was released, it curled up again. Finally, at nightfall, the good Brahman released Tapai, as Prospero released Ariel, and then he and his family lived happily afterwards!",India,"Source: J. D.

Straightening a Curly Hair,1175,The Brahmarâkshas and the Hair,"In a certain village there lived a very rich landlord who owned several villages, but was such a great miser that no tenant would willingly cultivate his lands, and those he had gave him not a little trouble. He was indeed so vexed with them that he left all his lands untilled, and his tanks and irrigation channels dried up. All this, of course, made him poorer and poorer day by day. Nevertheless, he never liked the idea of freely opening his purse to his tenants and obtaining their good will. While he was in this frame of mind a learned Sanayâsi [holy man] paid him a visit, and on his representing his case to him, he said, ""My dear son, I know an incantation (mantra) in which I can instruct you. If you repeat it for three months day and night, a Brahmarâkshas will appear before you on the first day of the fourth month. Make him your servant, and then you can set at naught all your petty troubles with your tenants. The Brahmarâkshas will obey all your orders, and you will find him equal to one hundred servants."" Our hero fell at his feet and begged to be instructed at once. The sage then sat facing the east and his disciple the landlord facing the west, and in this position formal instruction was given, after which the Sanayâsi went his way. The landlord, mightily pleased at what he had learnt, went on practicing the incantation, till, on the first day of the fourth month, the great Brahmarâkshas stood before him. ""What do you want, sir, for my hands?"" said he. ""What is the object of your having propitiated me for these three months?"" The landlord was thunderstruck at the huge monster who now stood before him and still more so at his terrible voice, but nevertheless said, ""I want you to become my servant and obey all my commands."" ""Agreed,"" answered the Brahmarâkshas in a very mild tone, for it was his duty to leave off his impertinent ways when anyone who had performed the required penance wanted him to become his servant. ""Agreed. But you must always give me work to do. When one job is finished you must at once give me a second, and so on. If you fail, I shall kill you."" The landlord, thinking that he would have work for several such Brahmarâkshasas, was pleased to see that his demoniacal servant was so eager to help him. He at once took him to a big tank, which had been dried up for several years, and pointing it out spoke as follows, ""You see this big tank; you must make it as deep as the height of two palmyra trees and repair the embankment wherever it is broken."" ""Yes, my master, your orders shall be obeyed,"" humbly replied the servant and fell to work. The landlord, thinking that it would take several months, if not years, to do the work in the tank, for it was two kos long and one kos broad, returned delighted to his home, where his people were awaiting him with a sumptuous dinner. When evening was approaching, the Brahmarâkshas came to inform his master that he had finished his work in the tank. He was indeed astonished and feared for his own life. ""What! Finished the work in one day which I thought would occupy him for months and years. If he goes on at this rate, how shall I keep him employed. And when I cannot find it for him he will kill me!"" Thus he thought and began to weep. His wife wiped the tears that ran down his face, and said, ""My dearest husband, you must not lose courage. Get out of the Brahmarâkshas all the work you can and then let me know. I'll give him something that will keep him engaged for a very very long time, and then he'll trouble us no more."" But her husband only thought her words to be meaningless and followed the Brahmarâkshas to see what he had done. Sure enough the thing was as complete as could be, so he asked him to plow all his lands, which extended over twenty villages! This was done in two ghatikas! The landlord now grew hopeless. ""What more work have you for me?"" roared the Brahmarâkshas, as he found that his master had nothing for him to do, and that the time for his eating him up was approaching. ""My dear friend,"" said he, ""my wife says she has a little job to give you. Do it please now. I think that is the last thing I can give you to do, and after it, in obedience to the conditions under which you took service with me, I must become your prey! At this moment his wife came to them, holding in her left hand a long hair, which she had just pulled out from her head, and said, ""Well Brahmarâkshas, I have only a very light job for you. Take this hair, and when you have made it straight, bring it back to me."" The Brahmarâkshas calmly took it, and sat in a pîpal tree to make it straight. He rolled it several times on his thigh and lifted it up to see if it became straight; but no, it would still bend! Just then it occurred to him that goldsmiths, when they want to make their metal wires straight, have them heated in fire; so he went to a fire and placed the hair over it, and of course it frizzled up with a nasty smell! He was horrified! ""What will my master's wife say if I do not produce the hair she gave me?"" So he became mightily afraid, and ran away. This story is told to explain the modern custom of nailing a handful of hair to a tree in which devils are supposed to dwell, to drive them away.",India,"Source: Georgiana Kingscote and Natêsá Sástrî, Tales of the Sun; or, Folklore of Southern India (London and Calcutta: W.

Straightening a Curly Hair,1175,The Devil and the Farmer,"The devil once called on a farmer and asked him if he could give him a job. ""What can you do?"" said the farmer. ""Oh! anything about a farm,"" said the devil. ""Well, I want a man to help me thresh a mow of wheat,"" says the farmer. ""All right,"" says the devil, ""I'm your man."" When they got to the barn, the farmer said to the devil, ""Which do you want to do, thresh or throw down?"" ""Thresh,"" said the devil. So the farmer got on top of the mow and began to throw down the sheaves of wheat onto the barn floor, but as fast as he could throw them down, the devil with one stroke of his flail knocked all the grain out of them and sent the sheaves flying out of the barn door. The farmer thought he had got a queer sort of a thresher man; and as he couldn't throw down fast enough for him, he says to him, ""Will you come and throw down?"" ""All right,"" says the devil. So the farmer gets down off the mow by the ladder, but the devil, he just gives a leap up from the barn floor to the top of the mow without waiting to go up the ladder. ""Are you ready?"" says the devil. ""Yes,"" says the farmer. With that the devil sticks his fork into as many sheaves as would cover the barn floor and throws them down. ""That'll do for a bit,"" says the farmer. So the devil sat down and waited till the farmer had threshed that lot, and when he was ready again, he threw another floor full; and before night they'd finished threshing the whole mow of wheat. The farmer couldn't help thinking a good deal about his new man, for he'd never seen such a one before. (He didn't know it was the devil, you know, because he took care not to let the farmer see his cloven foot.) So in the morning he got up early and went and spoke to a cunning man about it. The cunning man said it must be the devil that had come to him, and as he had asked him in, he couldn't get rid of him unless he could give him a job that he couldn't do. Soon after the farmer got home again, his new man wanted to know what he was to do that day, and the farmer thought he'd give him a teaser, so he says, ""Go into the barn, look, and count the number of grains there are in that pile of wheat that we threshed out yesterday."" ""All right,"" says old Nick, and off he went. In a few minutes he comes back and says, ""Master, there are so many"" (naming ever so many thousand or millions and odd, I don't know how many). ""Are you sure you counted them all?"" says the farmer. ""Every grain,"" says Satan. Then the farmer ordered him to go and fill a hogshead barrel full of water with a sieve. So off he shoots again, but soon comes back and tells the farmer he'd done it; and sure enough he had. And every job the farmer set him to do was the same. The poor farmer didn't know what to make of it, for though he was getting his work done up so quick, he didn't like his new man's company. However, the farmer thought he'd have another try to trick him, and told the devil he wanted him to go with him mowing next morning. ""All right,"" says the old one. ""I'll be there, master."" But as soon as it was night, the farmer went to the field, and in the part the devil was to mow, he drove a lot of harrow tines into the ground amongst the grass. In the morning they got to the field in smart time, and began to mow. The farmer he took his side, and told the devil to begin on the other, where he'd stuck in the harrow tines, you know. Well, at it went the devil, who but he, and soon got in among the stuck-up harrow tines, but they made no odds. His scythe went through them all, and the only notice on them he took was to say to the farmer every time he'd cut one of them through, ""a burdock, master,"" and kept on just the same. The poor farmer, he got so frightened at last, he threw down his scythe and left the devil to finish the field. As luck would have it, soon after he got home, a Gypsy woman called at the farm house, and seeing the farmer was in trouble, asked him what was the matter. So he up and told her all about it. ""Ah, master,"" she says to him when he had told her all about it, ""you have got the devil in your house sure enough, and you can only get rid of him by giving him something to do that he can't manage."" ""Well, woman,"" says the farmer, ""what's the use of telling me that? I tried everything I can think of, but darned if I can find him any job that he can't do."" ""I'll tell you what to do,"" says the Gypsy woman, ""When he comes home, you get the missus to give him one of her curly hairs, and then send him to the blacksmith's shop to straighten it on the blacksmith's anvil. He'll find he can't do that, and he'll get so wild over it, that he'll never come back to you again."" The farmer was very thankful to the Gypsy woman and said he'd try her plan. So by and by in comes the old fellow, and says, ""I have finished the mowing, master. What else have you got for me to do?"" ""Well, I can't think of another job just now,"" says the farmer, ""but I think the missus has got a little job for you."" So he called the missus, and she gave the devil a curly hair lapped up in a bit of paper, and told him to go to the blacksmith's shop and hammer that there hair straight; and when it was straight to bring it back to her. ""All right, missus,"" the devil says, and off he shot. When he got to the blacksmith's shop, he hammered and hammered at that there hair on the anvil, but the more he hammered the crookeder the hair got; so at last he threw down the hammer and the hair, and bolted, and never went back to the farmer again.",England,"Source: J.

Straightening a Curly Hair,1175,Tricking the Devil,"A young man made the following contract with the devil: The devil was to provide the man with money. In return, at a predetermined time the man was to give the devil work that would keep him busy an entire day. If the man were able to do this, then the devil would have given him the money for nothing. If he were not able to do this, then the man would belong to the devil, and the latter would be able to take him away. It came to pass that the time lapsed just as the man was celebrating his wedding. A boy came up to him and told him that a strange gentleman was outside who wanted to speak with him. The man immediately remembered the devil and did not go. The boy returned and called for him again, but still he did not go. Then the devil came inside personally and demanded either a task or the man himself. The man showed him a field of clover and told him to mow it. This would have taken a single man several days, but the devil finished it in an instant and demanded another task. Then the man took a bushel of clover seeds, scattered them over the field, and told the devil to gather them back up. It was a simple matter for him, and he was finished in a half hour. The man became terrified when the devil asked for yet another task. Then the man's bride noticed her husband's concern and said, ""What is the matter? Why do you keep running in and out?"" The man confessed everything to her and told her of the danger that he now faced. The bride said, ""I will help you. You should have told me about it earlier!"" Plucking out one of her short curly hairs, she gave it to her husband and said, ""Take this to the devil and demand that he straighten it!"" The man did this. The devil made an ugly face, then picked and pulled and bent away at the hair. He even placed it on an anvil and tried to pound it straight with a hammer, but it was all for nothing. The devil was not able to complete this task that day. The hair remained curly and crooked, and he was tricked out of his prize.",Germany,"Source: Ernst Meier, Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Schwaben (Stuttgart: C. P.

Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,Kilgrim Bridge,"Regarding the building of this [Kilgrim] bridge is the following curious legend: Many bridges having been built on this site by the inhabitants, none had been able to withstand the fury of the floods until his ""Satanic Majesty"" promised to build a bridge which would defy the fury of the elements, on condition that the first living creature who passed over should fall a sacrifice to his ""Sable Majesty."" Long did the inhabitants consider, when the bridge was complete, as to who should be the victim. A shepherd, more wise than his neighbors, owned a dog called Grim. This man having first swum the river, whistled for the dog to follow. Poor Grim unwittingly bounded across the bridge and thus fell a victim to his ""Sable Majesty.""

Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Devil's Bridge,"In the valley of Montafon, the bridge of the village broke down, or rather the swollen torrent carried it away; and as the parish was anxious to restore it as soon as possible, the villagers of course being unable to pass to and from Schruns, on the other side of the river, for all their daily wants, they applied to the village carpenter, and offered him a large sum of money if he would rebuild the bridge in three days' time. This puzzled the poor fellow beyond description; he had a large family and now his fortune would be made at once; but he saw the impossibility of finishing the work in so short a time, and therefore he begged one day for reflection. Then he set to work to study all day, up to midnight, to find out how he could manage to do the work within the specified time; and as he could find out nothing, he thumped the table with his fist, and called out, ""To the devil with it! I can find out nothing."" In his anger and annoyance he was on the point of going to bed, when all at once a little man wearing a green hat entered the room, and asked, ""Carpenter, wherefore so sad?"" and then the carpenter told him all his troubles. The little fellow replied, ""It is very easy to help you. I will build your bridge, and in three days it shall be finished, but only on the condition that the first soul out of your house who passes over the bridge shall be mine."" On hearing this, the carpenter, who then knew with whom he had to do, shuddered with horror, though the large sum of money enticed him, and he thought to himself, ""After all, I will cheat the devil,"" and so he agreed to the contract. Three days afterwards the bridge was complete, and the devil stood in the middle, awaiting his prey. After having remained there for many days, the carpenter at last appeared himself, and at that sight the devil jumped with joy; but the carpenter was driving one of his goats, and as he approached the bridge, he pushed her on before him, and called out, ""There you have the first soul out of my house,"" and the devil seized upon the goat. But, oh, grief and shame! First disappointed, and then enraged, he dragged the poor goat so hard by her tail that it came out, and then off he flew, laughed at and mocked by all who saw him. Since that time it is that goats have such short tails. A Swiss herdsman who often visited his girlfriend had either to make his way across the Reuss River with great difficulty or to take a long detour in order to see her. It happened that once he was standing on a very high precipice when he spoke out angrily, ""I wish that the devil were here to make me a bridge to the other side!"" In an instant the devil was standing beside him, and said, ""If you will promise me the first living thing that walks across it, I will build a bridge for you that you can use from now on to go across and back. The herdsman agreed, and in a few moments the bridge was finished. However, the herdsman drove a chamois across the bridge ahead of himself, and he followed along behind. The deceived devil ripped the animal apart and threw the pieces from the precipice. The bridge builder, being aware of the extreme gullibility of the fiend, consented, but outwitted him, for as soon as the bridge was completed, he brought a black goat, and placing it before him, pushed it across the bridge. Beelzebub's imp, in his rage at being outwitted, grasped the goat by the horns, and hurled it through the floor of the bridge. Every old Alsatian who comes from this part of Alsace will solemnly aver that the hole is still there, because all efforts at repairing the breach are frustrated by Beelzebub's imps. One day in the olden time, old Megan of Llandunach stood by the side of the river Mynach feeling very sorry for herself. The Mynach was in flood, and roared down the wooded dingle in five successive falls, tumbling over three hundred feet in less than no time. Just below the place where Megan was standing, there was a great cauldron in which the water whirled, boiled, and hissed as if troubled by some evil spirit. From the cauldron the river rushed and swirled down a narrow, deep ravine, and if the old woman had had an eye for the beauties of nature, the sight of the seething pot and the long shadowy cleft would have made her feel joyous rather than sorrowful. But Megan at this time cared for none of these things, because her one and only cow was on the wrong side of the ravine, and her thoughts were centered on the horned beast which was cropping the green grass carelessly just as if it made no difference what side of the river it was on. How the wrong-headed animal had got there Megan could not guess, and still less did she know how to get it back. As there was no one else to talk to, she talked to herself. ""Oh dear, what shall I do?"" she said. ""What is the matter, Megan?"" said a voice behind her. She turned round and saw a man cowled like a monk and with a rosary at his belt. She had not heard anyone coming, but the noise of the waters boiling over and through the rocks, she reflected, might easily have drowned the sound of any footsteps. And in any case, she was so troubled about her cow that she could not stop to wonder how the stranger had come up. ""I am ruined,"" said Megan. ""There is my one and only cow, the sole support of my old age, on the other side of the river, and I don't know how to get her back again. Oh dear, oh dear, I am ruined."" ""Don't you worry about that,"" said the monk. ""I'll get her back for you."" ""How can you?"" asked Megan, greatly surprised. ""I'll tell you,"" answered the stranger. ""It is one of my amusements to build bridges, and if you like, I'll throw a bridge across this chasm for you."" ""Well, indeed,"" said the old woman, ""nothing would please me better. But how am I to pay you? I am sure you will want a great deal for a job like this, and I am so poor that I have no money to spare, look you, no indeed."" ""I am very easily satisfied,"" said the monk. ""Just let me have the first living thing that crosses the bridge after I have finished it, and I shall be content."" Megan agreed to this, and the monk told her to go back to her cottage and wait there until he should call for her. Now, Megan was not half such a fool as she looked, and she had noticed, while talking to the kind and obliging stranger, that there was something rather peculiar about his foot. She had a suspicion, too, that his knees were behind instead of being in front, and while she was waiting for the summons, she thought so hard that it made her head ache. By the time she was halloed for, she had hit upon a plan. She threw some crusts to her little dog to make him follow her, and took a loaf of bread under her shawl to the riverside. ""There's a bridge for you,"" said the monk, pointing proudly to a fine span bestriding the yawning chasm. And it really was something to be proud of. ""H'm, yes,"" said Megan, looking doubtfully at it. ""Yes, it is a bridge. But is it strong?"" ""Strong?"" said the builder, indignantly. ""Of course it is strong."" ""Will it hold the weight of this loaf?"" asked Megan, bringing the bread out for underneath her shawl. The monk laughed scornfully. ""Hold the weight of this loaf? Throw it on and see. Ha, ha!"" So Megan rolled the loaf right across the bridge, and the little black cur scampered after it. ""Yes, it will do,"" said Megan. ""And, kind sir, my little dog is the first live thing to cross the bridge. You are welcome to him, and I thank you very much for all the trouble you have taken."" ""Tut, the silly dog is no good to me,"" said the stranger, very crossly, and with that he vanished into space. From the smell of brimstone which he had left behind him, Megan knew that, as she had suspected, it was the devil whom she had outwitted. And this is how the Bad Man's Bridge came to be built. The highway between Pateley Bridge and Grassington crosses, in the parish of Burnsall, the deep dell in which runs the small river Dibb, or Dibble, by a bridge known in legend as the Devil's Bridge. It might reasonably be supposed that Deep-Dell Bridge, or Dibble Bridge, was the correct and desirable designation, but legend and local tradition will by no means have it so, and account for the less pleasant name in the following manner. In the days when Fountain's Abbey was in its prime, a shoemaker and small tenant of part of the abbey lands, named Ralph Calvert, resided at Thorp-sub-Montem, and journeyed twice a year along this road to pay his rent to the abbot, dispose of the fruits of his six months' handiwork, and return the shoes entrusted to him on his previous visit for repair, and bring back with him, on his return, a bag well filled with others that needed his attention. The night before setting out on one of these occasions, he had a fearful dream, in which he struggled with the devil, who, in this wild, rocky ravine, amid unpleasant surroundings, endeavored to thrust Ralph into a bag, similar to the one in which he carried his stock-in-trade. This he and his wife feared boded no good. In the morning, however, he started on his journey, and duly reached the abbey, assisted at the service, did his business with the abbot and brethren, and then started, with his well filled bag, on his return homewards. When he arrived near home, in the deep ravine, where on previous occasions he had found but a small brook which he could easily ford, he now found a mountain torrent, through which he only with difficulty and some danger made his way. Having accomplished the passage, he sat down to rest and to dry his wetted garments. As he sat and contemplated the place, he could not but recall how exactly it corresponded with the spot seen in his dream, and at which the author of evil had tried to bag him. Dwelling on this brought anything but pleasant thoughts, and to drive them away, and to divert his mind, he struck up a familiar song, in which the name of the enemy finds frequent mention, and the refrain of which was: He was unaware of any presence but his own. But, to his alarm, another voice than his added a further line: Ralph thought of his dream. Then he fancied he saw the shadow of a man on the road. Then from a projecting corner of a rock he heard a voice reading over a list of delinquents in the neighborhood, with whom he must remonstrate -- Ralph's own name among the rest. Not to be caught eavesdropping, Ralph feigned sleep. But after a time was aroused by the stranger, and a long conversation ensued, the upshot of which was, after they had entered into a compact of friendship, that Satan informed the shoemaker who he was and inquired of the alarmed man if there was anything that he could do for him. Ralph looked at the swollen torrent and thought of the danger he had lately incurred in crossing it, and of his future journeys that way to the abbey. And then he said, ""I have heard that you are an able architect. I should wish you to build a bridge across this stream. I know you can do it."" At nightfall Ralph reached his home at Thorpe, and related his adventure to his wife, and added, ""In spite of all that is said against him, the Evil One is an honest gentleman, and I have made him promise to build a bridge at the Gill Ford on the road to Pateley. If he fulfils his promise, St. Crispin bless him."" The news of Ralph's adventure and of the promise soon spread among the neighbors, and he had no small amount of village chaff and ridicule to meet before the eventful Saturday -- the fourth day -- arrived. At last it came. Accompanied by thirty or forty of the villagers, Ralph made his way to the dell, where, on arrival, picture their astonishment at the sight! Lo, a beautiful and substantial bridge spanned the abyss! Surveyor, and mason, and priest pronounced it to be perfect. The latter sprinkled it with holy water, caused a cross to be placed at each approach to it, and then declared it to be safe for all Christian people to use. So it remained until the Puritan Minister of Pateley, in the time of the Commonwealth, discerning the story to be a Popish legend, caused the protecting crosses to be removed as idolatrous. After that time, neither the original builder nor any other person seems to have thought fit to keep the bridge in ""good and tenantable"" repair, and in time it fell into so disreputable and dangerous a condition, that the liberal and almost magic-working native of the parish -- Sir William Craven, Lord Mayor of London in the reign of the 1st James -- took the matter in hand and built upon the old foundations a more terrestrial, but not less substantial and enduring, structure. Still men call it the Devil's Bridge.","Austria Switzerland Switzerland/France Wales Wales Yorkshire, England","Source: Marie Alker Günther, Tales and Legends of the Tyrol (London: Chapman and Hall, 1874), pp. 179-81.

Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Devil's Bridge at Kirkby,"A cow belonging to a poor woman had strayed across the river at some convenient wading place, and not having returned with the town herd at milking time, the woman went forth to seek her. In the meantime the water had risen considerably, and, not being able to cross the river, the woman was in a dilemma, for her good man, a laborer, and her cow, were on the opposite side. At this juncture the devil, in human form, appeared on the other bank, no doubt assuming the soft guile of the tempter, promised to build a bridge, on condition that the first living thing which passed over should become his lawful prize; to this the woman gladly assented. Darkness deepened rapidly -- necessary for diabolical thought and deed, which in this instance was frustrated by the forethought of the woman, whose husband or herself had been singled out for the victim which was to propitiate the building of the bridge. At the appointed hour she returned, bringing with her a dog, and a delicious morsel wherewith to tempt it. The bridge was complete, and there stood his sable majesty, anxiously awaiting his victim. Suddenly, across the bridge, she threw the tempting morsel, and after it sprang the dog. The devil, seeing how cleverly he had been outwitted, gave forth a terrific howl, which aroused all the inhabitants in the old town, who at once rushed down to the river to ascertain the cause, thinking there had been an earthquake, instead of which they were agreeably astonished to find a substantial bridge, across which the woman, accompanied by her husband and dog, were driving the cow. And there still stands the remarkable structure to witness or attest the truth, as story says, if I lie, and as a further proof, below the bridge is still to be seen the Devil's Neck Collar -- a rock with a large perforation, which he lost from his neck in that wild unearthly plunge from the bridge, on finding his hellish scheme thwarted.",England,"Source: Edmund Bogg, A Thousand Miles of Wandering along the Roman Wall, the Old Border Region, Lakeland, and Ribblesdale (Leeds: Edmund Bogg, 1898), pp. 229-30.",NA,NA
Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Devil's Bridge in Cardiganshire,"The building story of the Devil's Bridge in Cardiganshire runs briefly thus: An old woman who had lost her cow spied it on the other side of the ravine, and was in great trouble about it, not knowing how to get over where the animal was. The devil, taking advantage of her distress, offered to throw a bridge over the ravine, so that she might cross and get her cow; but he stipulated that the first living creature to cross the bridge should be his. The old woman agreed; the bridge was built; and the devil waited to see her cross. She drew a crust of bread from her pocket, threw it over, and her little black dog flew after it. ""The dog's yours, sir,"" said the dame; and Satan was discomfited. In the story told of the old bridge over the Main at Frankfort, a bridge-contractor and his troubles are substituted for the old woman and her cow; instead of a black dog a live rooster appears, driven in front of him by the contractor. The Welsh Satan seems to have received his discomfiture good-naturedly enough; in the German tale he tears the fowl to pieces in his rage. In Switzerland, every reader knows the story told of the devil's bridge in the St. Gotthard pass. A new bridge has taken the place, for public use, of the old bridge on the road to Andermatt, and to the dangers of the crumbling masonry are added superstitious terrors concerning the devil's power to catch any one crossing after dark. The old Welsh bridge has been in like manner superseded by a modern structure; but I think no superstition like the last noted is found at Hafod.",Wales,"Source: Wirt Sikes, British Goblins: Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends, and Traditions, 2nd edition (London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, 1880), pp. 205-206.",NA,NA
Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Devil's Bridge in Lake Galenbeck,"In Lake Galenbeck (in the vicinity of Friedland) there is a tongue of land, probably artificial, that stretches about to the middle of the lake. It is called the devil's bridge, and is said to be the remains of a bridge started, but never completed, by the devil. A shepherd had to drive his herd completely around the lake in order to reach his pasture. This annoyed him, and one day he wished with a curse that a bridge went across the lake. He had scarcely uttered this wish when a man appeared before him. The man promised to build a bridge in one night, before the rooster crowed three times, under the condition that the shepherd would then belong to him. The shepherd entered into this agreement. That evening when he arrived home, he told his wife what had happened. She said nothing, but at midnight she went to the chicken coop and awakened the rooster, who thought that it was already morning, and crowed three times. The devil heard this. He was not finished with his work, and angrily flew off through the air without completing the bridge.",Germany,"Source: Karl Bartsch, ""Die Teufelsbrücke im Gahlenbeker See,"" Sagen, Märchen und Gebräuche aus Meklenburg [Mecklenburg], vol. 1 (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1879), no. 555, p. 400.",Bartsch's source: Fräulein W.

Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Legend of the Devil's Bridge,"According to legend, the head construction worker supervising the building of the bridge was worried about not completing the work on time. Thus, he made a pact with the devil: in exchange for his help to finish the bridge in one night, the devil demanded the soul of the first passerby to cross the bridge. However, feeling remorseful about giving a person's soul to the devil, the construction worked consulted with the local priest and they decided to have a dog cross the bridge first. Furious, the devil plunged into the river with the dog, never to be seen again. It is said that the dog, a white Maremma sheepdog, is sometimes seen walking on the bridge in the evenings at the end of October, and that he is the devil still looking for the soul of the head construction worker. Probably commissioned by the Countess Matilda of Tuscany in the 11th century, the Ponte della Maddalena, a remarkable example of medieval engineering, used to be on the Via Francigena, one of the most important pilgrimage routes in the Middle Ages. It took on the name of Ponte della Maddalena around 1500, because a statue of Mary Magdalene stood at the foot of the bridge in an oratory (now the statue is in the parish church of Borgo a Mozzano).",Tuscany,"Source: Italy Magazine.

Devil's Bridge Legends,1191,The Sachsenhäuser Bridge at Frankfurt,"There are two arches in the middle of the Sachsenhäuser Bridge. At the top they are closed partially only with wood which, in time of war, can easily be removed so that the connection can be destroyed without blasting. The following legend is told about this bridge: The builder had agreed to complete the bridge by a certain date. As the date approached he saw that it would be impossible to meet the deadline. With only two days remaining, in his fear he called upon the devil and asked him for help. The devil appeared to him and offered to complete the bridge during the last night if the builder would deliver to him the first living being that crossed the bridge. The contract was settled, and during the last night the devil completed the bridge. In the darkness no human eye saw how he did it. At the break of day the builder came and drove a rooster across the bridge ahead of himself, thus delivering it to the devil. However, the latter had expected a human soul, and when he saw that he had been deceived he angrily grabbed the rooster, ripped it apart, and threw it through the bridge, thus causing the two holes that to the present day cannot be mortared shut. Any repair work that is completed during the day just falls apart the next night.

Dividing Souls in the Graveyard,1791,Mother Elston's Bag of Nuts,"One fine night, after a neighbouring ""revel,"" three men rather the worse for drink came by, and saw some sheep in a field close to the churchyard. The thought struck them that here was a good opportunity for helping themselves, and while one man went into the church porch to keep watch, the others went to steal the sheep. Now, the man in the porch had brought a lot of nuts from the revel, and while waiting he began to eat them. Just then the sexton came by and heard nuts being cracked, sure enough. So off he ran to the vicarage to fetch the parson, who agreed to come at once. Unfortunately he was afflicted with St. Vitus' dance and could not walk, being obliged to go in a perambulator. ""Have you my perambulator?"" said the parson. ""No, sir; I don't naw where he's to,"" replied the sexton. ""Never mind; this little way you can carry me on your back,"" said the parson. So off they set, and just inside the churchyard they heard the nuts still being cracked. The sexton stopped. ""Go a little nearer,"" urged the parson. The sexton went a little nearer. ""Go a little nearer still""; and the sexton still went a little nearer. Then the parson began saying something to lay the ghost. But the man in the porch thought they were one of his mates with a sheep. ""Is he fat?"" he called. And the sexton was so frightened that he dropped the parson and ran away as fast as he could. But St. Vitus' dance comes with a fright and goes with a fright, they say, and the parson was quite cured from that minute, and could walk as well as ever he could after.",England (Devonshire),"Source: P.

Dividing Souls in the Graveyard,1791,The Bag of Nuts,"One of them said to the other, ""Where are you going?""

He said, ""I'm going to steal a fat sheep out of this field. Wait here till I come back."" Then the other man got the nuts that were under his dead mother's head, and stood in the church porch cracking them. In those days it was the custom to ring a bell at a certain time in the evening, and just as the man was cracking the nuts the sexton came into the churchyard to ring it. But when he heard the cracking of the nuts in the porch he was afraid, and ran to tell the parson, who only laughed at him, and said, ""Go and ring, fool."" However, the sexton was so afraid, that he said he would not go back unless the parson would go with him. After much persuasion the parson agreed to go, but he had the gout very badly, and the sexton had to carry him on his back. When the man in the porch who was cracking the nuts saw the sexton coming into the churchyard with the parson on his back he thought it was the man who had just gone out to steal the sheep, and had returned with a sheep on his back. So he bawled out, ""Is it a fat one?"" When the sexton heard this he was so frightened that he threw the parson down and said, ""Aye, and thou canst take it if thou lik'st.""

Dividing Souls in the Graveyard,1791,The Miller and the Tailor,"It so happened that on the very night after the burial a miller in a white coat came to the dead man's garden to steal a bag of nuts; and as he went along he met with a tailor in a black coat, an unthrifty fellow, and discovered to him his scheme. The tailor confessed in his turn that that same night he planned stealing a sheep. It was determined between them that each should effect his purpose, and that they should meet, later on, in the church porch, the one who came first to tarry for the other. The miller gathered his nuts, and was the first to reach the porch; and while he waited for the tailor, he sat down and cracked nuts. It being about nine o'clock, the sexton came to ring the curfew; and when he looked, and saw a man in the porch dressed in white and cracking nuts, he weened that it was the farmer risen from his grave, cracking the nuts that had been buried along with him, and sped home in all haste and told a cripple, who lived in the same house what he had beheld. This cripple, when he heard the sexton so speak, reproved him, and said that, were it in his power to go to the place, he would conjure the spirit. ""By my faith, if thou art not afraid, I will carry thee on my back,"" said the sexton. And the sexton took the cripple on his back, and brought him to the churchyard; whereupon the miller in the porch, seeing one approach with something on his back, and weening it had been the tailor with the sheep, rose up, and came toward them, saying, ""Is he fat? Is he fat?"" The sexton, hearing these words, cast down the cripple, and said, ""Fat or lean, take him as he is,"" and vanished; and the cripple by miracle was made whole, and ran as fast as the sexton, or faster. The miller, perceiving that there were two, and that one ran from the other, thought that one was the owner of the sheep and had espied the tailor stealing it; and lest somebody might have seen him steal the nuts out of the orchard, he left the shells behind him, and hied home to his mill. Presently came the tailor with the sheep on his back to seek him, as it had been arranged; and when he saw nought but nutshells, he concluded, as was indeed the truth, that the miller had gone home. So, throwing his sheep once more over his shoulder, he walked toward the mill. Meanwhile the sexton, when he ran away, went not to his own house, but to the parish priest, to whom he shewed how the spirit of the dead man was seated in the church porch eating nuts; and they both proceeded back together to the place, that the priest might conjure the spirit. The priest put on his stole and surplice, and took holy water with him; and as they went along, the tailor with the white sheep on his back met them, and in the dusk, taking the priest in his white surplice to be the miller in his white coat, shouted to him, ""By God! I have him! I have him!"" meaning the sheep which he had stolen. But the priest, seeing the tailor all in black and a white thing on his shoulder, imagined it to be the devil bearing away the spirit of the man that had just been buried, and ran away at full speed, the sexton following at his heels. The tailor judged that the two had been following him to take him for stealing the sheep, and thought that the miller might have got into trouble for stealing the nuts. So he went on toward the mill, to see if he could be of any use to the miller, and to hear what news. When he rapped at the mill-door, the miller called out, ""Who is there?"" The tailor answered and said, ""By God! I have caught one of them, and made him sure, and tied him fast by the legs."" Then the miller feared that the tailor had been taken and secured by the constable, and that he had now come to fetch him away for stealing the nuts; wherefore he ran out at a backdoor as fast as ever he could. The tailor heard the door open, and going to the other side of the mill saw the miller posting off; and for a few moments he stood musing there with his sheep on his back. The parish priest and the sexton, who had been hiding near the mill for fear of the spirit of the dead man, presently caught sight of the black tailor and the white sheep again, and fled in dismay, and the priest, not knowing the ground, leapt into a ditch, where the mud almost reached his chin. Then the tailor, perceiving that the miller ran one way and the sexton another, and that the priest cried for assistance, and supposing that it was the constable, who had come at last to arrest him, cast down the sheep, and also disappeared. Thus each man suffered misfortune, because some had done what was wrong and others what was foolish, and all were afraid without cause; and a good deal was owing to the time when it happened, for it was in the night that all this strange game of errors was played.",England,"Source: W.

Dividing Souls in the Graveyard,1791,Tom Daly and the Nut-Eating Ghost,"Tom Daly while alive was in the employ of a gentleman living at Drummond Castle. Young Tom got the father's place, and he looked on his godfather as he would on his own father, for the father and godfather had been great friends always, and Tom's mother was as fond of the godfather as she was of her own husband. Four years after old Tom died the godfather followed him. He was very fond of chestnuts, and when he came to die he asked his friends to put a big wooden dish of them in his coffin, so he might come at the nuts in the next world. They carried out the man's wishes. The godfather was buried, and the bedridden widow mourned for him as much as for her own husband. The young man continued to work for the gentleman at Drummond Castle, and in the winter it was often late in the evening before he could come home. There was a shortcut from the gentleman's place through a grove and past the graveyard. Young Tom was going home one winter night, the moon was shining very brightly. While passing the graveyard he saw a man on a big tomb that was in it, and he cracking nuts. Young Daly saw that it was on his godfather's tomb the man was, and when he remembered the nuts that were buried with him he believed in one minute that it was the godfather who was before him. He was greatly in dread then, and ran off as fast as ever his legs could carry him. When he reached home he was out of breath and panting. ""What is on you,"" asked the mother, ""and to be choking for breath?"" ""Sure I saw my godfather sitting on the tomb and he eating the nuts that were buried with him."" ""Bad luck to you,"" said the mother; ""don't be belying the dead, for it is as great a sin to tell one lie on the dead as ten on the living."" ""God knows,"" said Tom, ""that I'd not belie my godfather, and 'tis he that is in it; and hadn't I enough time to know him before he died?"" ""Do you say in truth, Tom, that 'tis your godfather?"" ""As sure as you are my mother there before me 'tis my godfather that's in the graveyard cracking nuts."" ""Bring me to him, for the mercy of God, till I ask him about your own father in the other world."" ""I'll not do that,"" said Tom. ""What a queer thing it would be to bring you to the dead."" ""Isn't it better to go, Tom dear, and speak to him? Ask about your father, and know is he suffering in the other world. If he is, we can relieve him with masses for his soul."" Tom agreed at last, and, as the mother was a cripple, all he could do was to put a sheet around her and take her on his back. He went then towards the graveyard. There was a great thief living not far from Kenmare, and he came that night towards the estate of the gentleman where Tom was working. The gentleman had a couple of hundred fat sheep that were grazing. The thief made up his mind to have one of the sheep, and he sent an apprentice boy that he had to catch one, and said that he'd keep watch on the top of the tomb. As he had some nuts in his pockets, the thief began to crack them. The boy went for the sheep, but before he came back the thief saw Tom Daly, with his mother on his back. Thinking that it was his apprentice with the sheep, he called out, ""Is she fat?"" Tom Daly, thinking it was the ghost asking about the mother, dropped her and said, ""Begor, then, she is, and heavy!"" Away with him, then, as fast as ever his two legs could carry him, leaving the mother behind. She, forgetting her husband and thinking the ghost would kill and eat her, jumped up, ran home like a deer, and was there as soon as her son. ""God spare you, mother, how could you come!"" cried Tom, ""and be here as soon as myself?"" ""Sure I moved like a blast of March wind,"" said the old woman; ""'tis the luckiest ride I had in my life, for out of the fright the good Lord gave me my legs again.""",Ireland,"Source: Jeremiah Curtin, Tales of the Fairies and of the Ghost World: Collected from Oral Tradition in South-West Munster (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1895), pp. 54-57.",NA,NA
Doctor Know-All,1641,Black Robin,"There was once an old man in North Wales called Robin Ddu, or Black Robin. He pretended to be a wizard, and though he had no magical power, he was so cunning that he made people believe he had, and his fame spread over the whole of Wales. A lady in the Vale of Towy lost three precious gems. They had been given to her by a dead sister, and she valued them all the more on that account. Every search was made for them, but they could not be found. The lady had not heard of the Well of Llanbedrog. (By means of that it is quite easy to discover who has stolen your property. All you have to do is to kneel by it, and after throwing in a bit of bread, name all whom you suspect. When the thief's name is mentioned, the bread sinks.) But she had heard of Black Robin, and at last she decided to send for him. She dispatched a servant to North Wales to offer him fifty pounds if he would restore her lost diamonds to her, and Robin traveled south with the messenger. When he arrived, he said he would not begin his work unless fifty pounds were given to him beforehand. ""Fifty pounds is a lot of money,"" said the lady. ""I should like to test your power before giving it you."" To this Robin reluctantly agreed. The lady put a tame robin redbreast under a dish on the table. Sending for the supposed magician, she asked him to say what was under the vessel. He did not know what to say or do, and thought the best thing he could do was to confess his ignorance. ""Robin is caught,"" he said. Thinking he referred to the bird and not to himself, the lady was astounded at what she regarded as a wonderful display of power, and Robin was too cunning to confess. The money was paid over, and the process of finding the gems began. First of all he inquired carefully into all the circumstances of the disappearance of the gems, cross-examining all the inmates of the house minutely. This investigation convinced him that one of the servants had stolen them, but for some time he could not find out the actual thief. One day, as he was taking the air with one of the menservants, he happened to enter the churchyard. The sexton in digging a grave had come across a quantity of old bones, among them being a skull. Robin took the skull back with him to his room, and his startled companion told the servants' hall about it. Then Robin called all the servants to him, and looking very stern, ""Tomorrow night,"" said he, ""I will summon a legion of devils, and they will punish the guilty with all the tortures of hell. But the innocent shall not suffer with the guilty. Take these,"" and with this he handed to each a tooth which he had wrenched from the skull. ""By Friday morning"" (it was then Wednesday) ""the guilty, after suffering unspeakable anguish and pain, will be as dead as the body from which these teeth have been taken. But I will not invoke my devils if the gems are brought to me before midnight, nor will I disclose to any living soul who took them."" Sure enough, before midnight on Thursday a trembling maidservant brought the diamonds to his room. The next thing to devise was how to restore them to their owner without disclosing the manner in which hey had been recovered, and at the same time in such a way as to reflect credit on himself as a magician. Looking out of his window in the morning he saw a flock of geese feeding in a field not far from the mansion. Going out he took with him a small piece of bread, in which he placed the stones. He threw the piece of bread to the gander, which at once greedily swallowed it. Some time after, summoning the lady, ""Kill that gander,"" he said, ""and you will find inside him your lost treasure."" This was done and the diamonds were found. ""They were dropped on the floor and accidentally swept out with the dust,"" he explained, ""and this greedy bird swallowed them. By means of the skull which the sexton dug out of the grave on Wednesday I was able to divine the mystery.""",Wales,"Source: W. Jenkyn Thomas, The Welsh Fairy Book (London: T.

Doctor Know-All,1641,Crab,"There was once a king who had lost a valuable ring. He looked for it everywhere, but could not find it. So he issued a proclamation that if any astrologer could tell him where it was he would be richly rewarded. A poor peasant by the name of Crab heard of the proclamation. He could neither read nor write, but took it into his head that he wanted to be the astrologer to find the king's ring. So he went and presented himself to the king, to whom he said, ""Your majesty must know that I am an astrologer, although you see me so poorly dressed. I know that you have lost a ring and I will try by study to find out where it is."" ""Very well,"" said the king, ""and when you have found it, what reward must I give you?"" ""That is at your discretion, your majesty."" ""Go, then, study, and we shall see what kind of an astrologer you turn out to be."" He was conducted to a room, in which he was to be shut up to study. It contained only a bed and a table on which were a large book and writing materials. Crab seated himself at the table and did nothing but turn over the leaves of the book and scribble the paper so that the servants who brought him his food thought him a great man. They were the ones who had stolen the ring, and from the severe glances that the peasant cast at them whenever they entered, they began to fear that they would be found out. They made him endless bows and never opened their mouths without calling him ""Mr. Astrologer."" Crab, who, although illiterate, was, as a peasant, cunning, all at once imagined that the servants must know about the ring, and this is the way his suspicions were confirmed. He had been shut up in his room turning over his big book and scribbling his paper for a month, when his wife came to visit him. He said to her, ""Hide yourself under the bed, and when a servant enters, say, 'That is one.' When another comes, say, 'That is two,' and so on."" The woman hid herself. The servants came with the dinner, and hardly had the first on entered when a voice from under the bed said, ""That is one."" The second one entered; the voice said, ""That is two,"" and so on. The servants were frightened at hearing that voice, for they did not know where it came from, and held a consultation. One of them said, ""We are discovered. If the astrologer denounces us to the king as thieves, we are lost."" ""Do you know what we must do?"" said another. ""Let us hear."" ""We must go to the astrologer and tell him frankly that we stole the ring, and ask him not to betray us, and present him with a purse of money. Are you willing?"" ""Perfectly."" So they went in harmony to the astrologer, and making him a lower bow than usual, one of them began, ""Mr. Astrologer, you have discovered that we stole the ring. We are poor people and if you reveal it to the king, we are undone. So we beg you not to betray us, and accept this purse of money."" Crab took the purse and then added, ""I will not betray you, but you must do what I tell you, if you wish to save your lives. Take the ring and make that turkey in the courtyard swallow it, and leave the rest to me."" The servants were satisfied to do so and departed with a low bow. The next day Crab went to the king and said to him, ""Your majesty must know that after having toiled over a month I have succeeded in discovering where the ring has gone to."" ""Where is it, then?"" asked the king. ""A turkey has swallowed it."" ""A turkey? Very well, let us see."" They went for the turkey, opened it, and found the ring inside. The king, amazed, presented the astrologer with a large purse of money and invited him to a banquet. Among the other dishes, there was brought on the table a plate of crabs. Crabs must then have been very rare, because only the king and a few others knew their name. Turning to the peasant the king said, ""You, who are an astrologer, must be able to tell me the name of these things which are in this dish."" The poor astrologer was very much puzzled, and, as if speaking to himself, but in such a way that the others heard him, he muttered, ""Ah! Crab, Crab, what a plight you are in!"" All who did not know that his name was Crab rose and proclaimed him the greatest astrologer in the world.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 109, pp. 314-16.",NA,NA
Doctor Know-All,1641,Doctor and Detective,"There was once an old farmer who had a great deal of turf, which he sold to customers in town. One day, when he drove to town with a large wagonload, he chanced to meet a doctor. This worthy man came walking along in a stately manner, with a long pipe in his mouth, a cane in his hand, and a doctor's hat on his head. Under his arm he had a thick doctor-book. He was wrapped in a long, loose mantle. The farmer tipped his hat reverently, whereupon the doctor addressed him and said that he would like to buy the turf. They talked back and forth for some time, and finally came to an agreement in regard to the price. The farmer was to have the long mantle, the pipe and the cane, the doctor's hat and the book, and the doctor was to receive the turf. The bargain was closed. The farmer secured the doctor's articles and the doctor the farmer's turf, and then each went his own way. It was late before the farmer returned home to his wife. She asked him at once if he had made a good bargain. When he produced the entire doctor's outfit she was not at all pleased, but wept, and asked, plaintively, how they would now obtain their bread and butter, since he had received no money for the turf. Her husband did his best to comfort her, saying that in a little while they would have all that they needed, for now he had decided to take up a doctor's profession. He put on the mantle and the doctor's hat, and with the long pipe dangling from between his teeth he sat from morning to night reading diligently in the large doctor-book. He looked exactly like a real doctor. No one would notice the slightest difference. But, nevertheless, no one came to consult him. Thinking the reason might be that no one knew of him, he at length decided to place a sign above his door stating, ""Here Lives the Greatest Doctor in the World,"" as he was sure this would at once turn the general attention towards him. He began to paint these letters on an old board. But as he had a very faint idea of writing -- in fact, this was the first time he had ever tried the art -- he wrote instead, ""Here Lives the Greatest Detective in the World."" A few days afterwards the king happened to pass the house of the ""Greatest Detective."" ""What in all the world is written on that sign?"" said he, dispatching one of his servants over to examine it closely. The servant reported that the sign advertised the greatest detective in the world. ""Well,"" said the king, ""I shall remember him and employ his services some day."" Some time after, it happened that a thief entered the royal stables and stole two of the king's best horses. A thorough search was made throughout the land, both for the thief and the horses, but without success. At length someone reminded the king of the detective whose house they had passed. ""Exactly so!"" cried the king. ""Now we shall find both thief and horses."" He at once bid one of his men go and seek the wise man's advice in the difficult problem. The man rode back, found the house, knocked at the door, and walked in. Here he saw the detective sitting in front of the table, reading in the large doctor-book. He took off his hat, bowed politely, and presented the king's compliments. ""I have come,"" he said, ""to ask --"" ""That is all very well,"" interrupted the doctor. ""I know it already."" ""Oh yes, of course you do,"" answered the messenger. ""Will you kindly direct me where to go and find them?"" ""Ye-es,"" replied the wise man, turning the leaves in the large book before him. ""I will tell you what to do. Wait a moment."" Now he took out a slip of paper which he had found among the leaves in the book, folded it, and handed it to the messenger, directing him to go to the drugstore and have this prescription filled. ""Take the medicine promptly,"" he concluded, ""then you will find them!"" He looked just as wise and important as any doctor in the land and waved his hand graciously at the messenger as a sign that the audience was at an end. The messenger lost no time in having the prescription filled, and as soon as the medicine was in his hand he took a drink from the bottle, and rode along as rapidly as he could, anxious to return to the king and relate his interview with the extraordinary man who seemed to know all beforehand. He had not gone very far, however, before the medicine began to act. Of a sudden he was seized with a terrible headache, and was obliged to seek refuge in a house near the road, where he was very kindly received. Thinking that a little rest would do him good, he lay down on a sofa in a room facing the yard. The headache became more and more severe, however, and the poor fellow cursed the wise man and his medicine with all his heart. But just as he complained of his evil fate, he heard the neighing of a horse in the stable across the yard. He arose quietly and approached the window, listening attentively, as the neighing seemed familiar to him. Now the horse neighed once more. His doubts vanished, and as the same moment his headache seemed to also completely vanish. Silently he opened the window, jumped into the yard, crept into the stable, and at once found the stolen horses, which he immediately untied. A few hours later he stood before the king, who did not know how to praise and reward the wisdom of the Great Detective before whom nothing was, of course, concealed. He lost no time in sending him two hundred dollars as a token of his high esteem and his gratitude. When the doctor received the money he said to his wife that a doctor's trade seemed to be a very easy one, and she answered that his bargain, which had seemed to her a foolish one, was, after all, quite satisfactory so far. Some time passed, when one day a beautiful gold ring belonging to the princess was stolen. A diligent search was made, but it seemed to have vanished altogether, with the thief. At length the Great Detective was named to the king as the right man to be consulted in this difficult affair. His majesty lost no time in sending a beautiful carriage and a messenger, with an invitation to the great man. Would he kindly assist in finding the gold ring which had been stolen? ""Yes, I know it all,"" said he to the messenger who stood before him, bowing politely, ""and I am willing to come."" So he entered the carriage in his complete doctor's outfit, followed by his wife, whereupon they drove to the royal palace. The king himself stepped forward and opened the carriage door to the worthy couple, bowing and scraping and making himself agreeable. He invited them to partake of a dinner. The following day they would begin the search for the ring. The wise man assented to this, and they proceeded to the dinner table, which was, of course, laid in a splendid and gorgeous manner. The doctor whispered to his wife that she must remember how many dishes they had. When all had been seated, the door was opened and in came the servant with the first dish. The wise man looked at his wife, nodded, and said, ""This is the first one."" He did not see -- in fact no one did -- that the servant turned as pale as a sheet, but busied himself with doing justice to the excellent things before him. The servant, however, was fearfully frightened, and before returning to the kitchen he stopped behind the chair of the Great Detective, plucking him by the sleeve in order to attract his attention, but without apparent result. The dismayed man had nothing to do but return to the kitchen. He was one of the thieves, and, with two other servants, had stolen the ring and buried it in the royal gardens under a large apple tree. Pale and trembling from fear, he told his two friends how the Great Detective had said to his wife, ""This is the first one"" -- meaning of course, the first thief. As the second servant was to carry in the next dish, his two comrades told him to do his best and ask the wise man to step into the kitchen. Perhaps he could be induced to spare their lives. As the servant entered the dining hall, the doctor said to his wife, ""This is the second one."" She nodded. The servant grew white from fear and pulled him from behind by the sleeve. The great man thought, however, of nothing but the dishes, and did not feel the servant's endeavor to attract his attention. Thus the poor fellow was obliged to return to the kitchen without having accomplished his errand. When the third servant entered, the doctor said to his wife, ""This is the third one."" The servant pulled him, however, so violently by the sleeve that he turned in his chair, asking what he wanted. ""Would he,"" whispered the unfortunate man, ""go with him into the kitchen?"" So he arose and followed him. When he entered the kitchen the three servants implored him to spare them. He was right. They had stolen the ring. The wise man looked keenly at the three culprits, bit his lips, and said that of course he had know it all the time. They were great rascals who deserved a severe punishment. He did not know whether he could really save them from the gallows. They now fell upon their knees and implored him to show mercy. They would be willing to give back the ring and pay him two hundred dollars if he would agree to keep their secret. This he promised, and before leaving them he told them to put the ring into a cake and serve it to the king's dog the next morning. They promised to do as he bid them. Next morning the king began to speak of the lost ring. The Great Detective assumed his most important air, looked around him, and finally fixed his glance upon the big dog which was walking about on the floor. They were just eating breakfast, and when one of the servants carried around the dishes he stole a glance at the doctor and nodded, thus assuring him that the dog had eaten the cake. ""Can you tell me where to find the thief and the ring?"" pursued the king. ""Both are in this room!"" answered he. The king looked around in great astonishment. ""Both in this room?"" repeated he. ""There is the thief,"" continued the doctor, pointing to the dog. Now the king was thoroughly amazed, and even angry. He thought the wise man made fun of him. ""Kill the thief,"" said the doctor, sternly, ""and you will be sure to find the ring."" They did so at once, and, indeed, found the ring in the stomach of the animal. The wise man received a great sum of money from the king, and afterward the three servants paid him the two hundred dollars which they had promised him for keeping their secret. But from this day the doctor became so famous that no one dared to steal. His very name frightened the thieves and made them control their evil instincts. Although he was no more called upon to detect stolen goods, he had already earned money enough for the rest of his lifetime. He lived happily many years, honored by everyone in the land.",Denmark,"Source: J. Christian Bay, Danish Folk Tales (New York and London: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1899), pp. 111-18.",NA,NA
Doctor Know-All,1641,Doctor Cure-All,"When he was coming away, says he to the doctor, ""Musha, sir, would you lend me one of these fine-bound books for about a quarter of a year or so, and I'll return it honestly?"" ""What is the book to be about?"" says the doctor, ""and what do you want with it?"" ""I don't care what it's about,"" says he, ""and I'll tell you when I return it the use I'll make of it."" The doctor laughed, and gave him a well-looking wolume, but I don't know no more nor the fagot-cutter himself what was in it. ""A fine thing,"" says he, ""to be slavin' oneself as I do for my bit and sup, and see what grandeur that man is in for doing nothing at all, as a body might say."" When he got home, he removed bag and baggage into the town after selling his little furniture, and buying a shute of broad cloth, and a Caroline hat, and a Barcelona hankecher. He got a painter to put up a sign-board with DOCTOR CURE-ALL over his door, put some bottles on a shelf, and sat down at his little round table with his book before him. Well, he soon got custom, but all the cures he knew was bowl almanac [Bole-Armeniac], salts and senna, castor oil, and sugar and soap for plasters. But he was so courageous in promising cures, and so many got well, no thanks to him, and there was so many that there was nothing amiss with at all, that he soon got a great name. He even recovered stolen things, for he gave out that he knew by his books who had them, and the thieves used to bring them unknownst to him, and give him some money for not telling on them. Well, there was a gentleman in the neighbourhood that had a very valuable ring taken from him, and he sent for Dr. Cure-all to find out the thief for him. ""I'll find him out,"" says he, ""if he's above ground, but it can't be done in a minute. I'll have to see where you kept it, and get a lock of hair from everyone in the house, and study my conjurin' book for eight days. The ninth morning you'll have the ring safe and sound. I'll have to stay on the premises the whole time."" ""Very good,"" says the gentleman. Well, he lived like a fighting cock for five days, but I give you my word he began then to get uneasy, for no one about the house seemed inclined to confess, though he gave out from the beginning that he'd have his hand on the thief the evening of the eighth day. The evening of the sixth he was walking in the paddock near the hedge, and he was muttering to himself, ""Three days only now, and be this and be that there goes one of 'em!"" says he in an angry voice. Well, there was three rogues of servants concerned in the robbery, and one of them was padrowlin' [patrolling] in the cabbage-garden the other side of the hedge the same minute. He never drew rein till he got to the other fellows, and says he, ""We're discovered as sure as fate."" Well, they talked and they talked, and didn't know what to do till next evening, when the second of 'em was close by the hedge, and what did he hear but the doctor cry out, ""And there goes the second of 'em!"" Well, they were more frightened now than before, and came to the point of confessing if the doctor knew there was three of 'em. The next evening the poor man was walking sorrowful enough in the same place. ""Ovoch!"" was he saying to himself, ""there was only three evenings of the time left since I took my walk here to give the thief an opportunity of talking to me,"" and then his heart was so bitter he cried out, ""Here is the third of 'em!"" ""Docthor, docthor,"" says a voice the other side of the hedge, ""you're a considherate man; here's the ring and a guinea-note along with it. Keep our secret."" ""You don't deserve it, you unlucky rogue, for delaying so long. The master 'ud have you in the stone-jug [gaol] tomorrow only for your late repentance."" Well, the whole family were assembled in the big parlour next morning, and the doctor sitting very stately in an arm-chair. ""Who is the robber?"" says the master. ""I know the robber, and the place he hid the ring,"" says the doctor, ""but I can only reveal one. Which is it to be?"" The master, of course, chose to get his valuable ring. ""Well, then,"" says he, ""go to the hen-house wherever that is; I don't know. Put your right hand on the little board that's inside over the door, and in the middle of it you'll find what you're in search of."" Out went the mistress and the little girl that minded the fowl, and there the ring was sure enough. Well, there was great joy, you may depend, and very great honour was paid to the wise man, but the master's brother that came that day on a visit, wouldn't give the doctor any credit at all. ""Wait till dinner time,"" says he ""and if I don't astonish his weak mind, you may say what you like."" Well, the brother and his servant were cooking something very secretly in the kitchen before dinner time, and when that was over, and the doctor's health was drunk, and himself greatly praised, says the brother, ""Doctor, I'll praise you more than all the family if you tell me what's in this covered plate."" Ah, wouldn't anyone pity the poor man at that moment? ""No use,"" says he to himself, ""in throwing sand in people's eyes any longer."" Then speaking out loud, says be, ""Ah, sir, let the fox go as far as he pleases, he'll be cotch [caught] at last."" ""Well,"" says the gentleman, ""I see I must give it up. It's a bit of a fox sure enough!"" He lifted the cover for an instant, and then threw plate and cover and fox out of the window. And that's the way with the world.

Doctor Know-All,1641,Doctor Know-All,"Once upon a time there was a poor peasant by the name of Crab who drove two oxen with a load of wood into town where he sold it to a doctor for two thalers. He received his money just as the doctor was sitting down to eat. When the peasant saw how well the doctor ate and drank, his heart took a longing for the same things, and he decided that he would like to have been a doctor. He stood there for a while, and then asked if he too could not become a doctor. ""Certainly,"" said the doctor, ""in no time at all."" ""What do I have to do?"" asked the peasant. First of all, buy yourself an ABC-book, one that has a picture of a rooster up front. Second, sell your wagon and your two oxen and buy yourself some clothing and other things that doctors use. Third, have yourself a sign painted with the words 'I am Doctor Know-All' and nail it above the door to your house."" The peasant did everything he was told to do. After he had doctored a little -- but not very much -- some money was stolen from a great and wealthy nobleman. Someone told him about the Doctor Know-All who lived in such and such a village, and who must know where the money had gone. So the nobleman had his carriage hitched up, rode out to the village, and asked him if he were Doctor Know-All. ""Yes, that I am."" ""Then you must come with me and recover my stolen money."" ""Yes, but my wife Grete must come along too."" The nobleman agreed and had them take their places in his carriage. They rode away together. They arrived at the nobleman's court just at mealtime, and the nobleman invited him to eat. ""Yes, but include my wife Grete,"" he replied, and the two of them sat down behind the table. When the first servant brought out a platter of fine food the peasant nudged his wife and said, ""Grete, that's the first one,"" meaning the meal's first course. However, the servant thought that he meant, ""That's the first thief,"" and because that is indeed what he was, he took fright, and outside he said to his comrades, ""The doctor knows everything. It's going to go badly for us. He said that I'm the first one."" The second one did not want to go inside at all, but finally he had to, and when he entered, the peasant nudged his wife and said, ""Grete, that's the second one."" This servant took fright as well, and went outside. It did not go any better for the third one. Once again the peasant said, ""Grete, that's the third one."" The fourth one brought in a covered platter, and the nobleman told the doctor that he should demonstrate his art by guessing what it contained. It was crabs. The peasant looked at the platter, and seeing no way out of his dilemma, he said to himself, ""Oh, poor Crab!"" Hearing this, the nobleman called out, ""If he knows that then he must know who has the money as well!"" The servant grew very fearful and motioned to the doctor to go outside. There all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money. They offered to give it all to him and a handsome sum in addition, if he would not turn them in. Otherwise they would all hang. They showed him where the money was hidden. The doctor was satisfied with this, and he went back inside and sat down again at the table. ""My lord,"" he said, ""Now I will look in my book to see where the money is hidden. However, the fifth servant climbed into the stove in order to hear if the doctor knew anything else. The doctor leafed back and forth in his book looking for the picture of the rooster. Not finding it, he said, ""I know that you are in there. Come on out."" The man in the stove thought that the doctor was talking to him, and terrified, he jumped out, saying, ""The man knows everything!"" Then Doctor Know-All showed the nobleman where the money was, but he did not tell who had stolen it. Thus he received a large reward from each side and became a famous man.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Doktor Allwissend,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, vol. 2 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 98, pp. 69-71.",NA,Translated by D.

Doctor Know-All,1641,Harisarman,"There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in a former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bridegroom, and merrymakers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron. While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him. Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his wife at night, ""It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge."" He said this to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on which his master's son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find the horse, though they searched in every direction. Then, while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him, ""My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences. He can get the horse back for you. Why do you not ask him?"" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who said, ""Yesterday I was forgotten, but today, now the horse is stolen, I am called to mind,"" and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words, ""I forgot you, forgive me,"" and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of pretended diagrams, and said, ""The horse has been placed by thieves on the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring it."" When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman. Then Harisarman was honored by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honored by Sthuladatta. Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his reputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to gain time, and said, ""I will tell you tomorrow,"" and then he was placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there was a maid named Jihva (which means tongue), who, with the assistance of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the palace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was about. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said, ""Oh tongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment in full."" When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard, ""Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession."" When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly, ""Depart, I know all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me."" When he said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But Harisarman reflected in his astonishment, ""Fate brings about, as if in sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear."" Thus thinking, he passed the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the king, by some skillful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden, and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate tree, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages. But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear, ""How can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied the books of magic. You may be certain that this is a specimen of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some new artifice."" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman, ""Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do you great honor today."" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of ""Froggie"" which his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out, ""This is a fine pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless self."" The people there, when they heard him say that, raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the object presented to him, and murmured, ""Ah! a great sage, he knows even about the frog!"" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world.",India,"Source: Jacobs, Indian Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1892), no. 11, pp. 85-89.","Jacobs' source: Somadeva, Kathá Sarit Ságara; or, Ocean of the Streams of Story.

Doctor Know-All,1641,John the Conjurer,"It so happened that a great quantity of plate was stolen from the king's palace, and notwithstanding the most diligent search it was impossible to find out who were the perpetrators of the robbery. As a last resource the king was counselled to order the famous magician to be brought to him, as nothing could be hidden from this man, although, it was remarked, he would not always display his power save only when he was in the humour to do so. The king ordered the magician to be brought into his presence; and the man, as may be imagined, when he came before his Majesty, was nearly dead from fright. The king informed him that he was to be shut up in prison for three days, and that if at the end of those three days he had not discovered the authors of the robbery, he would have him hanged as a liar and an impostor. ""I may as well prepare myself for death,"" thought John Cigarron, when he found himself in prison. ""Never would I have held myself forth as a magician if I had known what it would cost me. Only three days of life left to me; not one more nor one less! A nice scrape you've got into, John Cigarron!"" The truth was, that the plate had been stolen by three of the king's pages, who were the very youths charged to take the prisoner his food. When the first of them took his evening meal to the cell, John Cigarron, alluding to the three days to which his existence was limited by the king, exclaimed: The others would not believe it; but on the second day, when another of the three pages entered the cell with the food, and heard John Cigarron exclaiming sadly: ""You are right,"" he said to his companions. ""He knows, and we are lost!"" So when it came to pass on the following day that the third had to take the food in, and heard John Cigarron saying in despair: The three days having passed, the king commanded the magician to be brought into his presence, and the man entered with much pomposity. ""Well,"" said the king, ""do you bring me news of my lost property?"" ""Sire,"" responded John Cigarron, with great bombast, ""I am too noble and too philanthropic to betray anyone, but I confide in your Majesty being contented with my skill and power if the stolen plate be restored."" ""Yes, yes,"" replied the king, ""I shall be satisfied if the plate be given up. Where is it?"" John Cigarron drew himself up and responded, as he made a majestic gesture: ""Let someone go to the cell in which I was confined, and it will be found there."" This was done, and the plate, which had been carried there by the pages, was found. The king was struck with admiration, and took such interest in John Cigarron's fate, that he appointed him Chief Magician, Royal Diviner, and Soothsayer in Ordinary. But all this was far from gratifying to the office-bearer, who trembled with dread at the thought of what might present itself upon the next occasion when his Majesty should require his scientific services, and when, he feared, he might not emerge with such flying colours. And his fears were not quite groundless; for one day when the king was walking in his gardens he thought he would like another proof of his Chief Magician's skill, so he presented himself to him suddenly, with his hand closed, and asked him what he had in it. On hearing this unexpected question, the poor fellow was quite stupefied, and exclaimed: ""Sire, the game is up, Cigarron is in your hands now!"" A cry of admiration escaped from the king, who opened his hand and displayed what was in it; it was a large cigar (cigarron)! In his enthusiasm the king told the lucky conjurer to ask whatever he wished for; and whatever it should be, he gave him his royal word that he would grant it. In reply, John Cigarron said: ""Then, sire, I beg that you will never again put my powers of divination to the test!""",Spain,"Source: Fernan Caballero, The Bird of Truth and Other Fairy Tales (London: W.

Doctor Know-All,1641,Suan's Good Luck,"When she reached home, he cried, ""Mother, I know what you bought in the market today."" He then told her, article by article. This same thing happened so repeatedly, that his mother began to believe in his skill as a diviner. One day the ring of the datu's [village chieftain's] daughter disappeared. All the people in the locality searched for it, but in vain. The datu called for volunteers to find the lost ring, and he offered his daughter's hand as a prize to the one who should succeed. Suan's mother heard of the proclamation. So she went to the palace and presented Suan to the datu. ""Well, Suan, tomorrow tell me where the ring is,"" said the datu. ""Yes, my lord, I will tell you, if you will give your soldiers over to me for tonight,"" Suan replied. ""You shall have everything you need,"" said the datu. That evening Suan ordered the soldiers to stand around him in a semicircle. When all were ready, Suan pointed at each one of them, and said, ""The ring is here, and nowhere else."" It so happened that Suan fixed his eyes on the guilty soldier, who trembled and became pale. ""I know who has it,"" said Suan. Then he ordered them to retire. Late in the night this soldier came to Suan, and said, "" I will get the ring you are in search of, and will give it to you if you will promise me my safety."" ""Give it to me, and you shall be safe,"" said Suan. Very early the next morning Suan came to the palace with a turkey in his arms. ""Where is the ring? "" the datu demanded. ""Why, sir, it is in this turkey's intestines,"" Suan replied. The turkey was then killed, and the ring was found inside it. ""You have done very well, Suan. Now you shall have my daughter's hand,"" said the datu. So Suan became the princess's husband. One day the datu proposed a bet with anyone who wished to prove Suan's skill. Accordingly another datu came. He offered to bet seven cascos [cargo boats] of treasure that Suan could not tell the number of seeds that were in his orange. Suan did not know what to do. At midnight he went secretly to the cascos. Here he heard their conversation, and from it he learned the number of seeds in the orange. In the morning Suan said boastfully, ""I tell you, your orange has nine seeds."" Thus Suan won the whole treasure. Hoping to recover his loss, the datu came again. This time he had with him fourteen cascos full of gold. He asked Suan to tell him what was inside his golden ball. Suan did not know what to say. So in the dead of night he went out to the cascos, but he could learn nothing there. The next morning Suan was summoned into the presence of the two datus. He had no idea whatever as to what was in the ball; so he said scornfully, ""Nonsense!"" ""That is right, that is right!"" shouted a man. ""The ball contains nine cents."" Consequently Suan won the fourteen cascos full of gold. From now on, nobody doubted Suan's merit.",Philippines,"Source (books.google.com): Dean S.

Doctor Know-All,1641,The Charcoal Burner,"But one day he had got a kiln of charcoal ready burnt, and he set out for town with some loads of it and sold them. When he had done his business, he loitered down some of the streets and looked about him. On his way home he fell in with some neighbors and other people from the same parish, and he talked and bragged to them about all that he had seen in town. The most remarkable thing he saw, he said, was the great number of parsons he met, and all the people in the streets took off their hats to them. ""I wish I was a parson,"" he said, ""perhaps the people would take off their hats to me too; now, they don't appear to see me at all."" ""Well, your clothes are black enough, anyhow,"" said his neighbors; ""but now that we are on the way, we may as well call in at the sale at the old parson's, and get a glass with the others, and you can buy yourself a gown and ruff at the same time."" Yes, he did so, and when he came home he hadn't a penny left. ""I suppose you have brought both money and good manners home with you from town this time?"" said his wife. ""Good manners! yes, I should think so,"" said the charcoal burner. ""Just look here! I am a parson now. Here is both the gown and the ruff!"" ""Yes, very likely!"" said his wife; ""strong beer makes big words, it appears! You don't care how things go!"" ""You shouldn't boast or bother about the coals you are burning, till they are ready,"" answered the husband. But one day a great many people, dressed like parsons, passed the charcoal burner's house on their way to the palace, and it was plain to see that something was going to take place there, so the charcoal burner thought he would go as well, and put on the old parson's clothes. His wife thought it would be wiser of him to stay at home, for even if he got the chance to hold a horse for some grand person, she was afraid the sixpence he got for it would vanish down his throat, which usually was the case. ""Yes, everybody talks about the drink, but no one about the thirst, do they, mother?"" said the husband; ""the more one drinks, the more one thirsts,"" and with that he started for the palace. All the strangers were invited to come into the presence of the king, and the charcoal burner entered with the others. The king then told them that he had lost his most costly ring, and he felt sure it had been stolen. He had therefore called together all the learned clergy in the country, to hear if any of them could tell him who the thief was. And the king promised that he would handsomely reward the one who could tell him about it; if he was a curate, he should get a living; if he was a rector, he should be made a dean; if he was a dean, he should be made a bishop; and if he was a bishop, he should be the first man after the king. So the king went from one to the other, and asked them all if they could tell him who the thief was, and when he came to the charcoal burner, he said, ""Who are you?"" ""I am the wise parson and the true prophet,"" said the charcoal burner. ""Then you can tell me who has taken my ring?"" said the king. ""Well, it isn't beyond sense and reason, that what has happened in the dark might be brought to light,"" said the charcoal burner; ""but it isn't every year that the salmon plays in the fir-tops. I have now been studying and working for seven years to get bread for myself and my family, but I haven't got a living yet, so if the thief is to be found, I must have plenty of time and paper, for I must write and reckon early and late."" Yes, he should have as much time and paper as he wished, if he only could find the thief. So he got a room to himself in the palace, and before long they found out that he must know something more than writing a sermon, for he used so much paper that it lay about in heaps; but there wasn't one who could make out a word of all he had written, for it was only pothooks and marks like a crow's toes. But the time wore on, and he could not find any trace of the thief. So the king got tired of waiting, and told him that if he couldn't find the thief in three days, he should lose his life. ""Ah, but he that rules must not be hasty, but wait till his temper cools,"" said the charcoal burner. ""One can't begin and rake out the coals, till they are thoroughly burnt and the fire has gone out."" But the king stuck to what he said, and the charcoal burner felt his life wasn't worth much. Now it so happened, that it was three of the king's servants who waited upon him day by day in turn that had stolen the ring between them. So one day, when one of the servants came into his room and cleared away the table after supper, and was just about leaving the room, the charcoal burner heaved a deep sigh and looked after him and said, ""There goes the first of them."" But he only meant the first of the three days he still had to live. ""This parson knows all about it,"" said the servant, when he got his comrades by themselves, and told them that the parson had said, ""that he was the first of them."" The second servant, who was to wait upon him the next day, was to notice what he would say then, and sure enough, as he was going out after having cleared the table, the charcoal burner gazed steadily at him, sighed and said, ""There goes the second of them."" So the third servant was to observe what happened the third day; it got worse and worse he thought, for when the servant came to the door and was going out with all the plates and dishes, the charcoal burner folded his hands and said, ""There goes the third of them,"" and then he sighed as if his heart would break. The servant came breathlessly out to his comrades and told them it was clear enough that the parson knew all about it, and so they went into his room and fell on their knees before him, and prayed and begged of him, that he would not tell it was they who had taken the ring; they would give him a hundred dollars each, if he only would not bring them into trouble. He promised faithfully, that no one should get into trouble if he got the money, the ring, and a lump of porridge. He put the ring into the porridge, and told one of them to give it to the biggest pig belonging to the king. Next morning the king came; it was easy to see he would not be played with; he would know all about the thief. ""Well, I have written and reckoned far and wide,"" said the charcoal burner, ""but I find it's not a man who has stolen the ring."" ""Pooh! Who is it then?"" said the king. ""Oh, it's that big pig which belongs to your majesty,"" said the charcoal burner. Well, they brought out the pig and killed it, and, sure enough, the ring was found inside it. So the charcoal burner got a living, and the king was so pleased that he gave him a farm and horse and a hundred dollars in the bargain. It did not take the charcoal burner long to move, and the first Sunday after he had settled in his parish he was going to church to read his first sermon. But before he started he had to get some breakfast, and so he put the sermon on the bread plate; but he made a mistake and took the sermon instead of the bread, and dipped it into the soup, and when he felt it was so tough to chew, he gave it all to his dog, and the dog made short work of it and swallowed it all. When he found out his mistake, he was at a loss what to do. But he had to go to church, for his congregation was waiting for him; and when he came there, he went straight up into the pulpit He put on such a grand air while he was getting ready for the sermon, that all thought he must be a very fine preacher. But when he did begin, it wasn't so very fine after all. ""The words, my dear brethren, which you were going to hear this day, have gone to the dogs; but come again, some other Sunday, my dear parishioners, and you shall hear something else! And thus endeth this sermon!"" Well, all the people thought he was a queer parson, for they had never heard such a sermon; but then they thought he might improve, and if not -- why, they would know how to deal with him. Next Sunday the church was so crowded by people who wanted to hear the new parson, that there was scarcely room for them all in the church. As soon as the parson arrived, he went straight up into the pulpit, and then he stood for some time without saying a word, but all at once he made a start and cried out, ""I say, old mother Berit, why do you sit so far back in the church?"" ""Oh, my boots are in such a bad state, your reverence!"" said she. ""But you could have got an old pig's skin and made yourself a new pair of boots, and then you could have come to the front like other decent people. Besides, I wish you would all consider which way you are going, for I see that some of you, when you are coming to church, come from the north, and others come from the south, and the same when you leave church; but I suppose you stop and gossip on the way, and then they wonder at home what has become of you. Yea! who knows what will become of us all? And then I have to give notice, that the old parson's widow has lost her black mare. She had fetlocks round her hoofs, and a long mane, and more of this kind which I shan't mention in this place. And then I have a big hole in my old breeches pocket, which I know, but you don't! But whether any of you have a piece of some stuff, which would suit the hole, neither you nor I know."" Some of the people were well satisfied with the sermon, and believed that he in time would make a good parson, but most of them thought it was really too bad; and when the dean came round on one of his visits, they complained to him of the parson and said that such sermons were never heard before, and one of them happened to recollect the last one about the old widow's mare and repeated it all to the dean. ""That was a very good sermon,"" said the dean. ""He spoke very likely in parables and impressed upon you to seek the light and to shun the darkness and its deeds, when he spoke about those who were walking on the broad or the narrow road; and particularly do I consider his notice about the old widow's mare a splendid parable as to how it will fare with us all in the end. The breeches pocket with the hole in it referred to his wants, and the piece of stuff was the offerings and gifts he expected from his congregation,"" said the dean. ""Yes, we thought as much,"" they said. ""It was all about his offerings, sure enough!"" And so the dean said that he thought the parish had got such a good, sensible parson, that they should not complain of him, and the end was, that they got no other parson; but as time wore on he got worse instead of better, and so they complained to the bishop. Well, after a long time the bishop came round on a visitation, but the charcoal burner had been in the church the day before without anybody knowing of it, and had sawed the pulpit in several places, so it only hung together when one walked up the steps carefully. So when the congregation had assembled, and the parson was to preach before the bishop, he stole quietly up the steps and began his sermon in his usual style, but after having gone on for some time he spoke up, threw up his arms, and cried out, ""If there is any one here, who has any evil deed or thought in his mind, it were better he left this place, for today, this very day, there will be a fall, the like of which has not taken place since the creation of the world."" And with that he struck the pulpit with his hands, and down tumbled both pulpit and parson with such a crash, that the congregation took to their heels and ran out of the church, as if the day of judgment had come. So the bishop told the people that he wondered that the congregation could complain of a parson, who was so gifted and had such wisdom, that he could prophesy things that were to come. He thought he ought at least to be dean, and it was not long before he was made one. There was no help for it; they had to put up with him. Now it so happened, that the king and queen in that country had no children, but when the king heard that he was to have one he was curious to know whether he was to get a son and heir to his broad lands and acres, or if he only would get a princess. So all the learned men in the land were called to the palace to say which it would be. But as none of them were able to do this, both the king and the bishop happened to think of the new dean, and it did not take long till they had him brought before them and began questioning him. No, he could not tell, he said, for it wasn't easy to guess what no one could know anything about. ""Well, well!"" said the king, ""I don't care whether you know it or not; but you are the wise parson and the true prophet, who can foretell things to come, and if you won't tell me, you'll lose both your gown and your ruff! But never mind, I'll give you a trial first,"" and so he took the biggest silver tankard he had and went down to the sea shore with the parson. ""Can you tell me now, what I have got in this tankard?"" said the king; ""and if so, you can tell me the other thing I asked you as well,"" and he held the lid of the tankard tight. The charcoal burner wrung his hands in despair and cried, ""Oh, you unfortunate crawling crab of this earth, what have you now in return for all your toil and trouble!"" ""Ah, there you see! You did know it after all!"" said the king, for he had put a crab in the tankard. So the charcoal burner had to go back to the palace, where he was shown, into the queen's drawing room. He took a chair and sat down in the middle of the room, while the queen walked up and down the floor. ""One should never make a stall for the unborn calf, and never quarrel about the baby's name before it is born,"" said the charcoal burner, ""but I never saw anything like this before; when the queen comes towards me, I fancy it will be a prince, and when she walks away from me, it seems to me as if it will be a princess."" It turned out in time to be twins, and so the charcoal burner had made a lucky hit that time also. And thus for telling what no one could know anything about he got loads of money, and he became next man to the king.

Doctor Know-All,1641,The Cobbler Turned Doctor,"One day, however, he fell very ill; and the king of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy. Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretense of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it. Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless.

Doctor Know-All,1641,The Four Jogis,"This did not help the other three, but, further on, some frogs jumped into a pond as they passed by, and one of the others at once said: ""I know what I shall say! I shall say 'Plumpety plump! Down he has sat.'"" A little later, they saw a pig wallowing in the mud, and the third Jogi called out: ""I have it! I shall say 'Rub away, rub away! Now some more water! Rub away, rub away! I know, my boys, what you are going to do.'"" The fourth Jogi was still in perplexity but, when they came in sight of the raja's city, he exclaimed ""I know what I shall say: 'Highways and byeways, what a big city! The kotwal is going his rounds, his rounds.'"" Then they got a man to write down these four forms of address on a sheet of paper and presented it to the raja. The raja took it, and read it, and could not make head or tail of it. And when the four Jogis saw him looking so puzzled, they got frightened and took to their heels, for they could not read themselves and were not sure of what the paper really contained. Now the raja's chief officer was a Tehsildar, and he had also a barber, who shaved him every day. And that evening after the Jogis had run away, the Tehsildar proposed to the barber that, when shaving the raja the next morning, he should cut the raja's throat and they could then divide the kingdom between them, and the barber consented. Not content with this, the Tehsildar and the palace chowkidar that same night tried to break into the raja's palace and steal his money and jewelry. They began to cut a hole through the mud wall of the raja's room, but it chanced that the raja was so puzzled by the paper which the Jogis had put into his hand, that he kept on reading it over and over again, and just as the Tehsildar and chowkidar had half cut their way through the wall, they heard the raja saying: ""See, he throws up the earth, scrapety, scrape!"" At once they concluded that they had been heard and they crouched down; the raja went on: ""Plumpety, plump! Down he has sat."" This made them think that they had been seen and the chowkidar crept to the door to listen. He heard the raja saying: "" Highways and byeways, what a big city! The kotwal is going his rounds, his rounds!"" Then the chowkidar felt sure that he was discovered and he ran off with the Tehsildar, without completing their burglary. The next morning the barber went to shave the raja, and, while he was sharpening the razor, the raja again began to study the mysterious paper, murmuring ""Rub away, rub away, now some more water. Rub away, rub away! I know my boy what you are going to do."" The Barber thought that the raja referred to his rubbing water over his face for shaving, and concluded that the Tehsildar had revealed the plot; so he threw himself at the raja's feet and confessed everything, swearing that the Tehsildar and not he was to blame. The raja at once sent for the chowkidar to take the Tehsildar and Barber to prison. When the chowkidar came in he found the raja repeating ""See he throws up the earth, scrapety, scrape!"" He at once concluded that the raja was referring to the burglary and he fell on his knees and confessed all that had happened. This was news to the raja, but he went and saw the place where the wall had been partly cut through, and then he sent all the guilty men to prison and despatched messengers to look for the Jogis who had been the means of saving his life and property; but the Jogis had been so frightened and had run away so far, that they were never found.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 58, pp. 181-83.",NA,NA
Doctor Know-All,1641,The Stolen Treasure,"Once upon a time three jars full of money were stolen from a raja's palace. As all search was fruitless the raja at last gave notice that whoever could find them should receive one half of the money. The offer brought all the jans [witch-finders] and ojhas in the country to try their hand, but not one of them could find the treasure. The fact was that the money had been stolen by two of the raja's own servants, and it fell to the duty of these same two men to entertain the ojhas who came to try and find the money. Thus they were able to keep watch and see whether any of them got on the right track. Not far from the raja's city lived a certain tricky fellow. From his boyhood he had always been up to strange pranks, and he had married the daughter of a rich village headman. At the time that the raja's money was stolen his wife was on a visit to her father, and after she had been some time away, he went to fetch her home. However, on his way, he stopped to have a flirtation with a girl he knew in the village, and the result was that he did not get to his father-in-law's house till long after dark. As he stood outside he heard his wife's relations talking inside, and from their conversation he learned that they had killed a capon for supper, and that there was enough for each of them to have three slices of capon and five pieces of the vegetable which was cooked with it. Having learned this he opened the door and went in. The household was amazed at his arriving so late at night, but he explained that he had dreamed that they had killed a capon and were having a feast, and that there was enough for them each to have three slices of capon and five pieces of vegetable, so he had come to have a share. At this his father-in-law could do nothing but have another fowl killed and give him supper. He was naturally astonished at the trickster's powers of dreaming and insisted that he must certainly go and try his luck at finding the raja's stolen money. The trickster was taken aback at this, but there was no getting out of it. So the next morning he set out with his father-in-law to the raja's palace. When they arrived they were placed in charge of the two guilty servants, who offered them refreshments of curds and parched rice. As he was washing his hands after eating, the trickster ejaculated, ""Find or fail, I have at any rate had a square meal."" Now the two servants were named Find and Fail, and when they heard what the trickster said, they thought he was speaking of them, and had by some magic already found out that they were the thieves. This threw them into consternation, and they took the trickster aside and begged him not to tell the raja that they were the thieves. He asked where they had put the money, and they told him that they had hidden it in the sand by the river. Then he promised not to reveal their guilt, if they would show him where to find the money when the time came. They gladly promised and took him the raja. The trickster pretended to read an incantation over some mustard see, and then taking a bamboo went along tapping the ground with it. He refused to have a crowd with him ,because they would spoil the spell, but Find and Fail followed behind him and showed him where to go. So he soon found the jars of money and took them to the raja, who according to his promise gave him half their contents.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 68, pp. 206-208.",NA,NA
Dream Bread,1626,Comical History of Three Dreamers,"The tricking townsmen seeing this, said between themselves, ""We have but little bread, and this companion of ours is a great eater; on which account it is necessary we should think how we may eat this little bread without him."" When they had made it and set it to bake, the tradesmen seeing in what manner to cheat the countryman, said, ""Let us all sleep, and let him that shall have the most marvelous dream betwixt all three of us, eat the bread."" This bargain being agreed upon, and settled between them, they laid down to sleep. The countryman, discovering the trick of his companions, drew out the bread half baked, ate it by himself, and turned again to sleep. In a while, one of the tradesmen, as frightened by a marvelous dream, began to get up, and was asked by his companion, why he was so frightened. He answered, ""I am frightened and dreadfully surprised by a marvelous dream: it seemed to me that two angels, opening the gates of heaven, carried me before the throne of God with great joy."" His companion said, ""This is a marvelous dream, but I have seen another more marvelous, for I saw two angels, who carried me over the earth to hell."" The countryman hearing this, made as if he slept; but the townsmen, desirous to finish their trick, awoke him; and the countryman, artfully as one surprised, answered, ""Who are these that call me?"" They told him, ""We are thy companions."" He asked them, ""How did you return?"" They answered, ""We never went hence; why d'ye talk of our return?"" The countryman replied, ""It appeared to me that two angels, opening the gates of heaven, carried one of you before our Lord God, and dragged the other over the earth to hell, and I thought you never would return hither, as I have never heard that any had returned from paradise, nor from hell, and so I arose and eat the bread by myself.",Spain,"Source: John Aubrey, Miscellanies upon Various Subjects, 5th edition (London: Reeves and Turner, 1890), pp. 68-69.","Aubrey's source: ""From an old edition of Lazarillo de Tormes.""

Dream Bread,1626,Of the Deceits of the Devil,"""Should this loaf,"" they said to each other, ""be divided amongst us, there will not be enough for any one. Let us then take counsel together, and consider how the bread is to be disposed of."" ""Suppose we sleep upon the way,"" replied one of them; ""and whosoever hath the most wonderful dream shall possess the loaf?"" The other two acquiesced, and settled themselves to sleep. But he who gave the advice arose while they were sleeping and eat up the bread, not leaving a single crumb for his companions. When he had finished he awoke them. ""Get up quickly,"" said he, ""and tell us your dreams."" ""My friends,"" answered the first, ""I have had a very marvelous vision. A golden ladder reached up to heaven, by which angels ascended and descended. They took my soul from my body, and conveyed it to that blessed place, where I beheld the Holy Trinity, and where I experienced such an overflow of joy as eye hath not seen nor ear heard. This is my dream."" ""And I,"" said the second, ""beheld the devils with iron instruments, by which they dragged my soul from the body, and plunging it into hell flames, most grievously tormented me, saying, 'As long as God reigns in heaven this will be your portion.'"" ""Now then,"" said the third, who had eaten the bread, ""hear my dream. It appeared as if an angel came and addressed me in the following manner: 'My friend, would you see what is become of your companions?' I answered, 'Yes, Lord. We have but one loaf between us, and I fear that they have run off with it.' 'You are mistaken,' he rejoined, 'it lies beside us; follow me.' He immediately led me to the gate of heaven, and by his command I put in my head and saw you; and I thought that you were snatched up into heaven and sat upon a throne of gold, while rich wines and delicate meats stood around you. Then said the angel, 'Your companion, you see, has an abundance of good things, and dwells in all pleasures. There he will remain for ever; for he has entered the celestial kingdom, and cannot return. Come now where your other associate is placed.' I followed, and he led me to hell-gates, where I beheld you in torment, as you just now said. Yet they furnished you, even there, with bread and wine in abundance. I expressed my sorrow at seeing you in misery, and you replied, 'As long as God reigns in heaven here I must remain, for I have merited it. Do you then rise up quickly and eat up all the bread, since you will see neither me nor my companion again.' I complied with your wishes, arose, and eat the bread.""

Dream Bread,1626,"The ""Dream-Bread"" Story Once More","One night they got lost in the woods; The night was dark and lonely. At last the food they had gave out, Except a piece of baloney. As one of them took up a knife, I said, ""It's no use of carving, For if we share this piece of baloney, It won't keep us from starving."" So I suggested we all go to sleep, And so did Maloney. And the one that had the best of dreams Wins the piece of baloney. The following morn we all got up, It was quarter after seven. One of them said: ""I had a dream, I died and went to heaven; St. Peter met me at the gate, Riding on a pony. I guess that dream couldn't be beat, So that wins the piece of baloney."" The other one said: ""I too had a dream; I died and went to heaven; St. Peter met me at the gate, Stuck out his hand, and said, 'Hello, Maloney!'

Dream Bread,1626,The Three Travelers,"Then the Muslim proposed to divide them into three portions, so that each might eat his own portion when he pleased; but this also was objected to by the others, who quoted the proverb, ""The divider is in hell."" The Muslim explained to them that this proverb meant the man who divides his allegiance between God and lust; but they still refused to give way, and the Muslim therefore submitted, and lay down to sleep in the endurance of the pangs of hunger. Next morning, when they awoke, it was agreed between them that each should relate his dreams, and that the sweetmeats should be awarded to him whose dream was the best. The Jew said that he had dreamed that Moses had carried him to the top of Mount Sinai, and shown him marvelous visions of the glory of heaven and the angels. The Christian said he had dreamed that Jesus had carried him up to the fourth heaven and shown him all the glories of the heavens. Finally the Muslim said that the Prophet Muhammad had appeared to him in person, and after commending him for his piety in saying his prayers and keeping fast so strictly on the previous night, had commanded him to eat up those divinely provided sweetmeats as a reward, and he had accordingly done so. The Jew and the Christian were at first annoyed with him for thus stealing a march upon them; but on his pointing out that he had no option but to obey the Prophet's commands, they admitted that he had done right, and that his dream was the best, as he had been awake, while they were asleep. The moral is, that the divine treasure is revealed as an immediate intuition to those who seek it with prayer and humble obedience, and not to those who seek to infer and deduce its nature and quality from the lofty abstractions of philosophy.",The Masnavi,"Source: Jalal ad-D īn Muhammad Rumi, Masnavi I Ma'navi: The Spiritual Couplets (London: Trübner and Company, 1887), book 6, story 7, pp. 304-305.",Spelling modernized by D.

"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,A Cobbler in Someretshire,"When arrived there, he walked about the whole of the first day without anything occurring; the next day was passed in a similar manner. He resumed his place the third day, and walked about till evening, when, giving it up as hopeless, he determined to leave London, and return home. At this moment a stranger came up and said to him, ""I have seen you for the last three days walking up and down this bridge; may I ask if you are waiting for anyone?"" The answer was, ""No."" ""Then, what is your object in staying here?"" The cobbler then frankly told his reason for being there, and the dream that had visited him three successive nights. The stranger then advised him to go home again to his work, and no more pay any attention to dreams. ""I myself,"" he said ""had about six months ago a dream. I dreamt three nights together that, if I would go into Somersetshire, in an orchard, under an apple tree, I should find a pot of gold; but I paid no attention to my dream, and have remained quietly at my business."" It immediately occurred to the cobbler that the stranger described his own orchard and his own apple tree. He immediately returned home, dug under the apple tree, and found a pot of gold. After this increase of fortune, he was enabled to send his son to school, where the boy learnt Latin. When he came home for the holidays, he one day examined the pot which had contained the gold, on which was some writing. He said, ""Father, I can show you what I have learnt at school is of some use."" He then translated the Latin inscription on the pot thus: ""Look under, and you will find better."" They did look under, and a larger quantity of gold was found.",England,"Source: George Laurence Gomme, English Traditions and Foreign Customs (London: Elliot Stock, 1885), pp. 335-36.","Gomme's source: The Saturday Review, December 28, 1878.",NA

"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,Dreaming Tim Jarvis,"Now Balledehob is a small place, about forty miles west of Cork. It is situated on the summit of a hill, and yet it is in a deep valley; for on all sides there are lofty mountains that rise one above another in barren grandeur, and seem to look down with scorn upon the little busy village, which they surround with their idle and unproductive magnificence. Man and beast have alike deserted them to the dominion of the eagle, who soars majestically over them. On the highest of those mountains there is a small, and as is commonly believed, unfathomable lake, the only inhabitant of which is a huge serpent, who has been sometimes seen to stretch its enormous head above the waters, and frequently is heard to utter a noise which shakes the very rocks to their foundation. But, as I was saying, everybody knew Tim Jarvis to be a decent, honest, quiet, hard-working man, who was thriving enough to be able to give his daughter Nelly a fortune of ten pounds; and Tim himself would have been snug enough besides, but that he loved the drop sometimes. However, he was seldom backward on rent day. His ground was never distrained but twice, and both times through a small bit of a mistake; and his landlord had never but once to say to him, ""Tim Jarvis, you're all behind, Tim, like the cow's tail."" Now it so happened that, being heavy in himself, through the drink, Tim took to sleeping, and the sleep set Tim dreaming, and he dreamed all night, and night after night, about crocks full of gold and other precious stones; so much so, that Norah Jarvis his wife could get no good of him by day, and have little comfort with him by night. The grey dawn of the morning would see Tim digging away in a bog-hole, maybe, or rooting under some old stone walls like a pig. At last he dreamt that he found a mighty great crock of gold and silver, and where, do you think? Every step of the way upon London Bridge, itself! Twice Tim dreamt it, and three times Tim dreamt the same thing; and at last he made up his mind to transport himself, and go over to London, in Pat Mahoney's coaster; and so he did! Well, he got there, and found the bridge without much difficulty. Every day he walked up and down looking for the crock of gold, but never the find did he find it. One day, however, as he was looking over the bridge into the water, a man, or something like a man, with great black whiskers, like a Hessian, and a black cloak that reached down to the ground, taps him on the shoulder, and says he, ""Tim Jarvis, do you see me?"" ""Surely I do, sir,"" said Tim; wondering that anybody should know him in the strange place. ""Tim,"" says he, ""what is it brings you here in foreign parts, so far away from your own cabin by the mine of grey copper at Balledehob?"" ""Please your honor,"" says Tim, ""I'm come to seek my fortune."" ""You're a fool for your pains, Tim, if that's all,"" remarked the stranger in the black cloak; ""this is a big place to seek one's fortune in, to be sure, but it's not so easy to find it."" Now, Tim, after debating a long time with himself, and considering, in the first place, that it might be the stranger who was to find the crock of gold for him; and in the next, that the stranger might direct him where to find it, came to the resolution of telling him all. ""There's many a one like me comes here seeking their fortunes,"" said Tim. ""True,'' said the stranger. ""But,"" continued Tim, looking up, ""the body and bones of the cause for myself leaving the woman, and Nelly, and the boys, and traveling so far, is to look for a crock of gold that I'm told is lying somewhere hereabouts."" ""And who told you that, Tim?"" ""Why, then, sir, that's what I can't tell myself rightly; only I dreamt it."" ""Ho, ho! is that all, Tim?"" said the stranger, laughing; ""I had a dream myself; and I dreamed that I found a crock of gold, in the fort field, on Jerry Driscoll's ground at Balledehob; and by the same token, the pit where it lay was close to a large furze bush, all full of yellow blossom."" Tim knew Jerry Driscoll's ground well; and, moreover, he knew the fort field as well as he knew his own potato garden; he was certain, too, of the very furze bush at the north end of it. So, swearing a bitter big oath, says he, ""By all the crosses in a yard of check, I always thought there was money in that same field!"" The moment he rapped out the oath the stranger disappeared, and Tim Jarvis, wondering at all that had happened to him, made the best of his way back to Ireland. Norah, as may well be supposed, had no very warm welcome for her runaway husband -- the dreaming blackguard, as she called him -- and so soon as she set eyes upon him, all the blood of her body in one minute was into her knuckles to be at him; but Tim, after his long journey, looked so cheerful and so happy-like, that she could not find it in her heart to give him the first blow! He managed to pacify his wife by two or three broad hints about a new cloak and a pair of shoes, that, to speak honestly, were much wanting to her to go to chapel in; and decent clothes for Nelly to go to the patron with her sweetheart, and brogues for the boys, and some corduroy for himself. ""It wasn't for nothing,"" says Tim, ""I went to foreign parts all the ways; and you'll see what'll come out of it -- mind my words."" A few days afterwards Tim sold his cabin and his garden, and bought the fort field of Jerry Driscoll, that had nothing in it, but was full of thistles, and old stones, and blackberry bushes; and all the neighbors -- as well they might -- thought he was cracked! The first night that Tim could summon courage to begin his work, he walked off to the field with his spade upon his shoulder; and away he dug all night by the side of the furze bush, till he came to a big stone. He struck his spade against it, and he heard a hollow sound; but as the morning had begun to dawn, and the neighbors would be going out to their work, Tim, not wishing to have the thing talked about, went home to the little hovel, where Norah and the children were huddled together under a heap of straw; for he had sold everything he had in the world to purchase Driscoll's field, that was said to be ""the back-bone of the world, picked by the devil."" It is impossible to describe the epithets and reproaches bestowed by the poor woman on her unlucky husband for bringing her into such a way. Epithets and reproaches which Tim had but one mode of answering, as thus: ""Norah, did you see e'er a cow you'd like?"" -- or, ""Norah, dear, hasn't Poll Deasy a featherbed to sell?"" -- or, ""Norah, honey, wouldn't you like your silver buckles as big as Mrs. Doyle's?"" As soon as night came Tim stood beside the furze bush spade in hand. The moment he jumped down into the pit he heard a strange rumbling noise under him, and so, putting his ear against the great stone, he listened, and overheard a discourse that made the hair on his head stand up like bulrushes, and every limb tremble. ""How shall we bother Tim?"" said one voice. ""Take him to the mountain, to be sure, and make him a toothful for the old serpent; 'tis long since he has had a good meal,"" said another voice. Tim shook like a potato blossom in a storm. ""No,"" said a third voice; ""plunge him in the bog, neck and heels."" Tim was a dead man, barring the breath. ""Stop!"" said a fourth; but Tim heard no more, for Tim was dead entirely. In about an hour, however, the life came back into him, and he crept home to Norah. When the next night arrived the hopes of the crock of gold got the better of his fears, and takings care to arm himself with a bottle of potheen, away he went to the field. Jumping into the pit, he took a little sup from the bottle to keep his heart up -- he then took a big one -- and then, with desperate wrench, he wrenched up the stone. All at once, up rushed a blast of wind, wild and fierce, and down fell Tim -- down, down, and down he went -- until he thumped upon what seemed to be, for all the world, like a floor of sharp pins, which made him bellow out in earnest. Then he heard a whisk and a hurra, and instantly voices beyond number cried out: Welcome, Tim Jarvis, dear! Welcome, down here!"" Though Tim's teeth chattered like magpies with the fright, he continued to make answer: ""I'm he-he-har-ti-ly ob-ob-liged to-to you all, gen-gentlemen, fo-for your civility to-to a poor stranger like myself."" But though he had heard all the voices about him, he could see nothing, the place was so dark and so lonesome in itself for want of the light. Then something pulled Tim by the hair of his head, and dragged him, he did not know how far, but he knew he was going faster than the wind, for he heard it behind him, trying to keep up with him, and it could not. On, on, on, he went, till all at once, and suddenly, he was stopped, and somebody came up to him, and said, ""Well, Tim Jarvis, and how do you like your ride?"" ""Mighty well! I thank your honor,"" said Tim; ""and 'twas a good beast I rode, surely!"" There was a great laugh at Tim's answer; and then there was a whispering, and a great cugger mugger, and coshering; and at last a pretty little bit of a voice said, ""Shut your eyes, and you'll see, Tim."" ""By my word, then,"" said Tim, ""that is the queer way of seeing; but I'm not the man to gainsay you, so I'll do as you bid me, any how."" Presently he felt a small warm hand rubbed over his eyes with an ointment, and in the next minute he saw himself in the middle of thousands of little men and women, not half so high as his brogue, that were pelting one another with golden guineas and lily-white thirteens, as if they were so much dirt. The finest dressed and the biggest of them all went up to Tim, and says he, ""Tim Jarvis, because you are a decent, honest, quiet, civil, well-spoken man,"" says he, ""and know how to behave yourself in strange company, we've altered our minds about you, and will find a neighbor of yours that will do just as well to give to the old serpent."" ""Oh, then, long life to you, sir!"" said Tim, ""and there's no doubt of that."" ""But what will you say, Tim,"" inquired the little fellow, ""if we fill your pockets with these yellow boys? What will you say, Tim, and what will you do with them?"" ""Your honor's honor, and your honor's glory,"" answered Tim, ""I'll not be able to say my prayers for one month with thanking you -- and indeed I've enough to do with them. I'd make a grand lady, you see, at once of Norah -- she has been a good wife to me. We'll have a nice bit of pork for dinner; and, maybe, I'd have a glass, or maybe two glasses; or sometimes, if 'twas with a friend, or acquaintance, or gossip, you know, three glasses every day; and I'd build a new cabin; and I'd have a fresh egg every morning, myself, for my breakfast; and I'd snap my fingers at the 'squire, and beat his hounds, if they'd come coursing through my fields; and I'd have a new plow; and Norah, your honor, should have a new cloak, and the boys should have shoes and stockings as well as Biddy Leary's brats -- that's my sister what was -- and Nelly should marry Bill Long of Affadown; and, your honor, I'd have some corduroy for myself to make breeches, and a cow, and a beautiful coat with shining buttons, and a horse to ride, or maybe two. I'd have every thing,"" said Tim, ""in life, good or bad, that is to be got for love or money -- hurra-whoop! -- and that's what I'd do."" ""Take care, Tim,"" said the little fellow, ""your money would not go faster than it came, with your hurra-whoop."" But Tim heeded not this speech: heaps of gold were around him, and he filled and filled away as hard as he could, his coat and his waistcoat and his breeches pockets; and he thought himself very clever, moreover, because he stuffed some of the guineas into his brogues. When the little people perceived this, they cried out, ""Go home, Tim Jarvis, go home, and think yourself a lucky man."" ""I hope, gentlemen,"" said he, ""we won't part for good and all; but maybe ye'll ask me to see you again, and to give you a fair and square account of what I've done with your money."" To this there was no answer, only another shout, ""Go home, Tim Jarvis; go home; fair play is a jewel; but shut your eyes, or ye'll never see the light of day again."" Tim shut his eyes, knowing now that was the way to see clearly; and away he was whisked as before -- away, away he went 'till he again stopped all of a sudden. He rubbed his eyes with his two thumbs -- and where was he? -- Where, but in the very pit in the field that was Jer Driscoll's, and his wife Norah above with a big stick ready to beat ""her dreaming blackguard."" Tim roared out to the woman to leave the life in him, and put his hands in his pockets to show her the gold; but he pulled out nothing only a handful of small stones mixed with yellow furze blossoms. The bush was under him, and the great flag-stone that he had wrenched up, as he thought, was lying, as if it was never stirred, by his side: the whiskey bottle was drained to the last drop; and the pit was just as his spade had made it. Tim Jarvis, vexed, disappointed, and almost heart-broken, followed his wife home; and, strange to say, from that night he left off drinking, and dreaming, and delving in bog-holes, and rooting in old caves. He took again to his hard working habits, and was soon able to buy back his little cabin and former potato garden, and to get all the enjoyment he anticipated from the fairy gold. Give Tim one or, at most, two glasses of whiskey punch (and neither friend, acquaintance, or gossip can make him take more), and he. will relate the story to you much better than you have it here. Indeed it is worth going to Balledehob to hear him tell it. He always pledges himself to the truth of every word with his forefingers crossed; and when he comes to speak of the loss of his guineas, he never fails to console himself by adding: ""If they stayed with me I wouldn't have luck with them, sir; and father O'Shea told me 'twas as well for me they were changed, for if they hadn't, they'd have burned holes in my pocket, and got out that way."" I shall never forget his solemn countenance, and the deep tones of his warning voice, when he concluded his tale, by telling me, that the next day after his ride with the fairies, Mick Dowling was missing, and he believed him to be given to the serpent in his place, as he had never been heard of since. ""The blessing of the saints be between all good men and harm,"" was the concluding sentence of Tim Jarvis's narrative, as he flung the remaining drops from his glass upon the green sward.",Ireland,"Source: Thomas Crofton Croker, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland, part 2 (London: John Murray, 1828), pp. 221-33.",Link to additional legends of fairy abduction: Abducted by Aliens.,NA
"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,Dundonald Castle,"In Ayrshire, the following rhyme is prevalent, and is probably very old: alluding to Dundonald Castle, the ancient seat of King Robert II, and now the last remaining property in Ayrshire of the noble family who take their title from it. According to tradition, it was built by a hero named Donald Din, or Din Donald, and constructed entirely of stone, without the use of wood, a supposition countenanced by the appearance of the building, which consists of three distinct stories, arched over with strong stonework, the roof of one forming the floor of another. Donald, the builder, was originally a poor man, but had the faculty of dreaming lucking dreams. Upon one occasion he dreamed, thrice in one night, that if he were to go to London Bridge, he would become a wealthy man. He went accordingly, saw a man looking over the parapet of the bridge, whom he accosted courteously, and, after a little conversation, entrusted with the secret of the occasion of his coming to London Bridge. The stranger told him that he had made a very foolish errand, for he himself had once had a similar vision, which direct him to go to a certain spot in Ayrshire, in Scotland, where he would find a vast treasure, and, for his part, he had never once thought of obeying the injunction. From his description of the spot, the sly Scotsman at once perceived that the treasure in question must be concealed in no other place than his own humble kail-yard [cabbage patch] at home, to which he immediately repaired, in full expectation of finding it. Nor was he disappointed; for, after destroying many good and promising cabbages, and completely cracking credit with his wife, who esteemed him mad, he found a large potful of gold coin, with the proceeds of which he built a stout castle for himself, and became the founder of a flourishing family.",Scotland,"Source: Robert Chambers, Popular Rhymes of Scotland, new edition (London and Edinburgh: W. and R. Chambers, 1870), pp. 236-38.","Note by Chambers: Dundonald Castle, the scene of King Robert's early attachment and nuptials with the fair Elizabeth (Mure), is situated in Kyle-Stewart, of which, from the remotest period, it appears to have been the chief messuage, about six miles southwest of Rowallan, and approaching within about a mile of the Firth of Clyude. Its situation, on the summit of a beautiful round hill, in the close vicinity of Dundonald Church, is singularly noble and baronial. Although evidently of considerable antiquity, yet certainly another of still greatly more remote origin to the present castle of Dundonald once occupied the same site. To the more remote building may allude the following rude rhyme, if it be not altogether a piece of rustic wit of recent times: There stands a castle in the west, They ca' it Donald Din; There's no nail in a' its proof, Nor yet a wooden pin. --History of the House of Rowallan, p. 50.

"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,How the Junkman Traveled to Find Treasure in His Own Yard,"Often did he moralize on the sad Kismet that had reduced him to the task of daily laboring for his bread to make a shoe, perhaps for an ass. Surely he, a true Muslim, might at least be permitted to ride the ass. His eternal longing often found satisfaction in passing his hours of sleep in dreams of wealth and luxury. But with the dawning of the day came reality and increased longing. Often did he call on the spirit of sleep to reverse matters, but in vain; with the rising of the sun began the gathering of the cinders and iron. One night he dreamt that he begged this nocturnal visitor to change his night to day, and the spirit said to him, ""Go to Egypt, and it shall be so."" This encouraging phrase haunted him by day and inspired him by night. So persecuted was he with the thought that when his wife said to him, from the door, ""Have you brought home any bread?"" he would reply, ""No, I have not gone; I will go tomorrow; "" thinking she had asked him, "" Have you gone to Egypt?"" At last, when friends and neighbors began to pity poor Ahmet, for that was his name, as a man on whom the hand of Allah was heavily laid, removing his intelligence, he one morning left his house, saying, ""I go! I go! to the land of wealth!"" And he left his wife wringing her hands in despair, while the neighbors tried to comfort her. Poor Ahmet went straight on board a boat which he had been told was bound for Iskender (Alexandria), and assured the captain that he was summoned thither, and that he was bound to take him. Half-witted and mad persons being more holy than others, Ahmet was conveyed to Iskender. Arriving in Iskender, Hadji Ahmet roamed far and wide, proceeding as far as Cairo, in search of the luxuries he had enjoyed at Constantinople when in the land of Morpheus, which he had been promised to enjoy in the sunshine, if he came to Egypt. Alas! for Hadji Ahmet; the only bread he had to eat was that which was given him by sympathizing humanity. Time sped on, sympathy was growing tired of expending itself on Hadji Ahmet, and his crusts of bread were few and far between. Wearied of life and suffering, he decided to ask Allah to let him die, and wandering out to the pyramids he solicited the stones to have pity and fall on him. It happened that a Turk heard this prayer, and said to him, ""Why so miserable, father? Has your soul been so strangled that you prefer its being dashed out of your body, to its remaining the prescribed time in bondage?"" ""Yes, my son,"" said Hadji Ahmet. ""Far away in Stamboul, with the help of God, I managed as a junkman to feed my wife and myself; but here am I, in Egypt, a stranger, alone and starving, with possibly my wife already dead of starvation, and all this through a dream."" ""Alas! Alas! my father! that you at your age should be tempted to wander so far from home and friends, because of a dream. Why, were I to obey my dreams, I would at this present moment be in Stamboul, digging for a treasure that lies buried under a tree. I can even now, although I have never been there, describe where it is. In my mind's eye I see a wall, a great wall, that must have been built many years ago, and supporting or seeming to support this wall are towers with many corners, towers that are round, towers that are square, and others that have smaller towers within them. In one of these towers, a square one, there live an old man and woman, and close by the tower is a large tree, and every night when I dream of the place, the old man tells me to dig and disclose the treasure. But, father, I am not such a fool as to go to Stamboul and seek to verify this. It is an oft-repeated dream and nothing more. See what you have been reduced to by coming so far."" ""Yes,"" said Hadji Ahmet, ""it is a dream and nothing more, but you have interpreted it. Allah be praised, you have encouraged me; I will return to my home."" And Hadji Ahmet and the young stranger parted, the one grateful that it had pleased Allah to give him the power to revive and encourage a drooping spirit, and the other grateful to Allah that when he had despaired of life a stranger should come and give him the interpretation of his dream. He certainly had wandered far and long to learn that the treasure was in his own garden. Hadji Ahmet in due course, much to the astonishment of both wife and neighbors, again appeared upon the scene not a much changed man. In fact, he was the cinder and iron gatherer of old. To all questions as to where he was and what he had been doing, he would answer, ""A dream sent me away, and a dream brought me back."" And the neighbors would say, ""Truly he must be blessed."" One night Hadji Ahmet went to the tree, provided with spade and pick, that he had secured from an obliging neighbor. After digging a short time a heavy case was brought to view, in which he found gold, silver, and precious jewels of great value. Hadji Ahmet replaced the case and earth and returned to bed, much lamenting that it had pleased God to furnish women, more especially his wife, with a long tongue, long hair, and very short wits. ""Alas!"" he thought, ""If I tell my wife, I may be hung as a robber, for it is against the laws of nature for a woman to keep a secret."" Yet, becoming more generous when thinking of the years of toil and hardship she had shared with him, he decided to try and see if, by chance, his wife was not an exception to other women. Who knows, she might keep the secret. To test her, at no risk to himself and the treasure, he conceived a plan. Crawling from his bed, he sallied forth and bought, found, or stole an egg. This egg on the following morning he showed to his wife, and said to her, ""Alas! I fear I am not as other men, for evidently in the night I laid this egg; and, wife mine, if the neighbors hear of this, your husband, the long-suffering Hadji Ahmet, will be bastinadoed, bowstrung, and burned to death. Ah, truly, my soul is strangled."" And without another word Hadji Ahmet, with a sack on his shoulder, went forth to gather the cast-off shoes of horse, ox, or ass, wondering if his wife would prove an exception in this, as she had in many other ways, to other women. In the evening he returned, heavily laden with his finds, and as he neared home he heard rumors, ominous rumors, that a certain Hadji Ahmet, who had been considered a holy man, had done something that was unknown in the history of man, even in the history of hens: that he had laid a dozen eggs. Needless to add that Hadji Ahmet did not tell his wife of the treasure, but daily went forth with his sack to gather iron and cinders, and invariably found, when separating his finds of the day, in company with his wife, at first one, and then more gold and silver pieces, and now and then a precious stone.",Turkey,"Source: Cyrus Adler and Allan Ramsay, Told in the Coffee House: Turkish Tales (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1898), pp. 35-42.","The episode describing the junkman's wife embellishment of his ""secret"" is classified as a type 1381D folktale.",NA
"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,Numan's Dream,"When the teacher had made the boy read through the Koran, he told the boy to fetch him his present. So the boy came and told his father. His father said, ""O son, the Koran is the Word of God Most High, we have nothing worthy of it; there is our camel with which I follow my trade of water seller, take it at least and give it to thy teacher."" The boy took the camel and brought it to his teacher. But that day his father could gain no money, and that night his wife and his son and himself remained hungry. Now his wife was a great scold, and when she saw this thing she said, ""Out on thee, husband, art thou mad? Where are thy senses gone? Thou hadst a camel, and by means of it we made shift to live, and now thou hast taken and given it in a present; would that that boy had not been born, or that thou hadst not sent him to read; what is he and what his reading?' And she made so much noise and clamor that it cannot be described. Numan saw this thing, and he bowed down his head, and from the greatness of his distress he fell asleep. In his dream a radiant elder, white-bearded and clad in white raiment, came and said, ""O Numan, thy portion is in Damascus; go, take it."" Just then Numan awoke and he saw no one, and he arose and said, ""Is the vision divine or is it satanic?"" While saying this, he again fell asleep, and again he saw it. Brief, the elder appeared three times to him that night in his dream and said, ""Indeed is thy provision in Damascus; delay not, go to Damascus and take it."" When it was morning Numan spake to his wife of the vision; his wife said, ""Thou gavest away our camel and didst leave us hungry, and now thou canst not abide our complaints and wishest to run off; I fear thou wilt leave thy child and me here and go off."" Numan said, ""My life, I will not run off."" Quoth the woman, ""I will not bide, I will not bide; where thou goest I too will go with thee."" Numan sware that he would not run off, and the woman was persuaded and let him go. So Numan went forth; and one day he entered Damascus, and he went in through the gate of the Amawi Mosque. That day someone had baked bread in an oven and was taking it to his house; when he saw Numan opposite him and knew him to be a stranger, he gave him a loaf. Numan took it and ate it, and lay down through fatigue and fell asleep. That elder again came to him in his vision and said, ""0 Numan, thou hast received thy provision; delay not, go back to thy house."" Numan awoke and was amazed and said, ""Then our bearing this much trouble and weariness was for a loaf."" And he returned. One day he entered his house, and the woman looked and saw there was nothing in his hand; and Numan told her. When the woman learned that Numan had brought nothing, she turned and said, ""Out on thee, husband, thou art become mad, thou art a worthless man; had thy senses been in thy head, thou hadst not given away our camel, the source of our support, and left us thus friendless and hungry and thirsty; not a day but thou doest some mad thing."" And she complained much. And Numan's heart was broken by the weariness of the road and the complaining of the woman, and he fell asleep. Again in his vision that elder came and said, ""O Numan, delay not, arise, dig close by thee, thy provision is there, take it."" But Numan heeded not. Three times the elder appeared to him in his dream and said, ""Thy provision is indeed close by thee; arise, take it."" So Numan, unable to resist, arose and took a pick-axe and shovel and began to dig where his head had lain. The woman made mock of Numan and said, ""Out on thee, man; the half of the treasure revealed to thee is mine."" Numan replied, ""So be it; but I am weary, come thou and dig a bit that I may take breath a little."" The woman said, ""Thou art not weary now; when thou art weary I will help."" Numan went on: and when he had dug as deep as half the height of a man, a marble slab appeared. The woman saw the marble and, saying in herself, ""This is not empty,"" she asked the pick-axe from Numan. Numan said, ""Have patience a little longer."" The woman said, ""Thou art weary."" Numan replied, ""Now am I rested."" Quoth the woman, ""I am sorry for thee, thou dost not know kindness."" While thus talking they saw that one side of that marble was pierced and that there was a hole. Thereupon grew Numan eager, and he pulled the marble from its place, and below it was a well and a ladder. He caught hold of the ladder and went down and saw a royal vase filled full with red gold, and he called out to the woman, ""Come here."" Thereupon the woman descended likewise and saw the vase of gold, and she threw her arms round Numan's neck and said, ""O my noble little husband! Blessed be God, for thy luck and thy fortune."" Numan took up some of these sequins, and the woman said, ""What wilt thou do?"" Numan replied, ""I shall take these to our king and tell him that there is a vase full of them, and that an elder came to me in my dream and told me, and I shall say, 'Take them all; and, if thou wilt, bestow on me a few of them that I and my wife may eat and drink, and in our comfort may bless and praise thee.'"" Quoth the woman, ""My life, husband, speak not to our king now, so that all of them may remain ours and we shall have ease of heart."" Numan listened not, but took them and laid them before the king. The king said, ""What is this?"" Numan answered, ""O king, I found them in thy ground."" And he told of the elder's coming in his dream and of there being a vase full of them, and said, ""O king, send a slave of thine, and he will return; and I shall accept the king's alms, whatever it may be."" The king said to a scribe, ""Come, read this, let us see from whose time it has remained."" When the scribe took the sequin into his hand he saw that there was written on the one side of it, ""This is an alms from before God to Numan."" Then the scribe turned over the other side and saw that it was thus written on that side, ""By reason of his respect toward the Koran."" When the scribe had read the inscriptions to the king, the king said, ""What is thy name?"" He replied, ""My name is Numan."" The king caused all these sequins to be read, and the writing on the whole of them was the same. The king said, ""Go ye and bring some from the bottom of the vase."" And they went and brought some from the bottom of the vase, and they read them, and they all bore the inscription of the first. And the king wondered and said, ""Go, poor man, God Most High has given it thee, on my part too be it lawful for thee; come, take these sequins also."" So Numan took them and went to his house, and he took out the sequins that were in the vase; and he enjoyed delight in the world until he died, and in the hereafter he attained a lofty station. And all this felicity was for his respect to the glorious Koran.",Turkey,"Source: Sheykh-Zada, ""The Twenty-Sixth Vezir's Story,"" The History of the Forty Vezirs; or, The Story of the Forty Morns and Eves, translated by E.

"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,The Bridge of the Kist,"""I could make right use of a treasure,"" thinks he to himself. ""For 'tis heart scalded I am with dwelling in poverty, and a great weariness is on me from toiling for a miserable wage."" Then he bethought of the foolishness of making the journey if all turned out a deceit. ""Sure I'll be rid of belief in the dreams are driving me daft with their grandeur and perseverance,"" says he. ""Evenly failure will bring a sort of satisfaction for I'll get fooling whatever spirit does be bringing the vision upon me."" So my brave Michael Hugh took an ash plant in his hand, and away with him oversea to England to discover the bridge of the kist. He was a twelvemonth travelling and rambling with no success to rise his heart, and he began for to consider he had better return to his own place. But just as he was making ready to turn didn't he chance on a strong flowing river, and the sight near left his eyes when he found it was spanned by the bridge he was after dreaming of. Well Michael Hugh went over and he looked down on the black depth of water was flowing in under the arch. ""It'll be a hard thing surely to be digging for a kist in that place,"" says he. ""I'm thinking a man would find a sore death and no treasure at all if he lepped into the flood. But maybe it's laid out for me to gather my fortune here, and some person may come for to give me instruction."" With that he walked up and down over the bridge, hoping for further advice since he could not contrive a wisdom for his use. There was a house convenient to the river, and after awhile a man came from it. ""Are you waiting on any person in this place?"" says he to Michael Hugh. ""It's bitter weather to be abroad and you be to be as hardy as a wild duck to endure the cold blast on the bridge."" ""I'm hardy surely,"" Michael Hugh makes his answer. ""But 'tis no easy matter to tell if I'm waiting on any person."" ""You're funning me,"" says the Englishman. ""How would you be abroad without reason, and you having a beautiful wise countenance on you?"" With that Michael Hugh told him the story of the dreams that brought him from Ireland, and how he was expectant of a sign to instruct him to come at the kist. The Englishman let a great laugh. ""You're a simple fellow,"" says he. ""Let you give up heeding the like of visions and ghosts, for there is madness in the same and no pure reason at all. There's few has more nor better knowledge than myself of how they be striving to entice us from our work, but I'm a reasonable man and I never gave in to them yet."" ""Might I make so free as to ask,"" says Michael Hugh, ""what sort of a vision are you after resisting?"" ""I'll tell you and welcome,"" says the Englishman. ""There isn't a night of my life but I hear a voice calling: 'Away with you to Ireland, and seek out a man the name of Michael Hugh. There is treasure buried in under a lone bush in his garden, and that is in Breffny of Connacht.'"" The poor Irishman was near demented with joy at the words, for he understood he was brought all that journey to learn of gold was a stone's throw from his own little cabin door. But he was a conny sort of a person, and he never let on to the other that Michael Hugh was the name of him, nor that he came from Breffny of Connacht. The Englishman invited him into his house for to rest there that night, and he didn't spare his advice that dreams were a folly and sin. ""You have me convinced of the meaning of my visions,"" says Michael Hugh. ""And what's more I'll go home as you bid me."" Next morning he started out, and he made great haste with the desire was on him to get digging the gold. When he came to his own place in Connacht he made straight for a loy and then for the lone bush. Not a long was he digging before he hoked out a precious crock full of treasure, and he carried it into the house. There was a piece of a flag stone lying on top of the gold, and there was a writing cut into it. What might be the meaning of that Michael Hugh had no notion, for the words were not Gaelic nor English at all. It happened one evening that a poor scholar came in for to make his cailee. ""Can you read me that inscription, mister?"" asks Michael Hugh, bringing out the flag. ""Aye surely,"" says the poor scholar. ""That is a Latin writing, and I am well learned in the same."" ""What meaning is in it?"" asks the other. ""'The same at the far side,'"" says the scholar. ""And that is a droll saying surely when it gives no information beyond."" ""Maybe it will serve my turn, mister!"" says Michael Hugh, in the best of humour. After the scholar was gone on his way, didn't himself take the loy and out to the garden. He began for to dig at the far side of the lone bush, and sure enough he found a second beautiful kist the dead spit of the first. It was great prosperity he enjoyed from that out. And he bought the grandest of raiment, the way the neighbours began for to call him Michael Hughie the Cock.",Ireland,"Source (books.google.com): Bampton Hunt, Folk Tales of Breffny (London: Macmillan and Company, 1912), no. 09, pp. 83-88.

He arose very early and hurried to Zirl. At sunrise he was already standing by the bridge there. After walking back and forth for a quarter hour, he was approached by a goat herder who wished him a good morning, then drove his herd onward. He did not see anyone for a long time after that. Noon finally arrived, and hunger was tormenting him. He took a piece of Turkish bread [a confection made from peanuts] from his pocket and let it suffice, for he was not going to leave the bridge for any price. But however long he waited, no one came to him. He was losing his patience, and he was irritated by the thought of how his wife would laugh at him and ridicule him for his gullibility. But he nevertheless held out, until finally the sun was about to set, and the goat herder returned with his herd.

"The Man Who Became Rich

At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked any alms, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there, or what his business was; to which the peddler honestly answered that he had dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge he should hear good news; at which the shopkeeper laughed heartily, asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand, adding, ""I'll tell you, country fellow, last night I dreamed that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me where I thought that behind a peddler's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak tree, if I dug I should find a vast treasure!

Presently, as fate would have it, a company of thieves entered the mosque and made their way thence into an adjoining house; but the people of the house, being aroused by the noise, awoke and cried out; whereupon the chief of the police came to their aid with his officers. The robbers made off; but the police entered the mosque and finding the man from Baghdad asleep there, laid hold of him and beat him with palm-rods, till he was well-nigh dead. Then they cast him into prison, where he abode three days, after which the chief of the police sent for him and said to him, ""Whence art thou?"" ""From Baghdad,"" answered he. ""And what brought thee to Cairo?"" asked the magistrate. Quoth the Baghdadi, ""I saw in a dream one who said to me, 'Thy fortune is at Cairo; go thither to it.' But when I came hither, the fortune that he promised me proved to be the beating I had of thee. The chief of the police laughed, till he showed his jaw teeth, and said, ""O man of little wit, thrice have I seen in a dream one who said to me, 'There is in Baghdad a house of such a fashion and situate so-and-so, in the garden whereof is a fountain and thereunder a great sum of money buried. Go thither and take it.' Yet I went not; but thou, of thy little wit, hast journeyed from place to place, on the faith of a dream, which was but an illusion of sleep.""

Based on Indian, Persian, and Arab folklore, this work dates back at least 1000 years as a unified collection, with many of its individual stories undoubtedly being even older. One of the collection's forebears is a book of Persian tales, likely of Indian origin, titled A Thousand Legends. These stories were translated into Arabic about 850, and at least one reference from about the year 950 calls them The Thousand and One Nights.

"The Man Who Became Rich
through a Dream",1645,The Swaffham Legend,"It is said that this tinker dreamed that if he went to London Bridge he would, to use the phraseology of a certain class of advertisements, ""hear of something greatly to his advantage."" Nothing daunted by the difficulties of so long a journey five hundred years ago, when, not to utter a hint of railroads, even stage coaches had not been invented, the tinker heeded the voice of his good spirit, and went to London. After standing about the bridge for several hours -- some versions of the legend mention the traditional three days -- a man accosted him, and invited him to unfold the nature of his errand. With candor quite equal to his faith, John Chapman replied that he came there on the ""vain errand of a dream."" Now it appears that the stranger was a dreamer also, but, unlike the tinker, he was neither superstitious nor imprudent. ""Alas! good friend,"" said he, ""if I had heeded dreams, I might have proved myself as very a fool as thou art, for 'tis not long since I dreamt that at a place called Swaffham in Norfolk dwelt John Chapman, a pedlar, who hath a tree at the back of his house, under which is buried a pot of money."" John Chapman, of course, on hearing this hastened home, dug under his tree, and very soon found the treasure. But not all of it. The box that he found had a Latin inscription on the lid, which of course John Chapman could not decipher. But though unlettered, he was not without craftiness and a certain kind of wisdom, so in the hope that some unsuspicious wayfarer might read the inscriptiou in his hearing, he placed it in his window. It was not long before he heard some youths turn the Latin sentence into an English couplet: With a heart overflowing with gratitude for his good fortune, the tinker shortly afterwards, when the inhabitants of Swaffham wished to re-edify their church, astonished the whole town by offering to defray the expense of a large portion of the works. On the ends of the oaken bench nearest the pulpit, there is the carved effigy of John Chapman on one side and that of his dog on the other, and this is sufficient to establish the truth of the legend in the minds of the credulous of the district.",England,"Source: John Glyde, The Norfolk Garland: A Collection of the Superstitious Beliefs and Practices, Proverbs, Curious Customs, Ballads, and Songs of the People of Norfolk (London: Jarrold and Sons, 1872), pp. 68-70.",NA,NA

But I wouldn' go, for it was only foolishness."" Then he told him so plainly about the house that the first man knew it was his own, so he went back to the Island. When he got home he dug under the little thorn tree by the chimney and he found an iron box. He opened the box, and it was full of gold, and there was a letter in it, but he could not read the letter because it was in a foreign language. So he put it in the smithy window and challenged any scholar who went by to read it. None of them could, but at last one big boy said it was Latin and it meant, ""Dig again and you'll find another."" So the man dug again under the thorn tree, and what did he find but another iron box full of gold!

He went, traveling the whole distance from Upsall to London on foot. Arrived there, he took his station on the bridge, where he waited till his patience was nearly exhausted, and the idea that he had acted a very foolish part began to arise in his mind. At length he was accosted by a Quaker, who kindly inquired what he was waiting there so long for. After some hesitation, he told his dreams. The Quaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that he had had that night a very curious dream himself, which was, that if he went and dug under a certain bush in Upsall Castle in Yorkshire, he would find a pot of gold; but he did not know where Upsall was, and inquired of the countryman if he knew, who, seeing some advantage in secrecy, pleaded ignorance of the locality; and then, thinking his business in London was completed, returned immediately home, dug beneath the bush, and there he found a pot filled with gold, and on the cover an inscription in a language he did not understand. The pot and cover were, however, preserved at the village inn, where one day a bearded stranger like a Jew made his appearance, saw the pot, and read the inscription, the plain English of which was: The man of Upsall, hearing this, resumed his spade, returned to the bush, dug deeper, and found another pot filled with gold far more valuable than the first. Encouraged by this, he dug deeper still, and found another yet more valuable. This story has been related of other places, but Upsall appears to have as good a claim to this yielding of hidden treasure as the best of them.

He looked up, and there was Mr. Hawk sailing around and around. Every time he sailed around, he got a little closer, but Brer Rabbit didn't notice this, and by and by, down he dropped right slam-bang on Brer Rabbit, and there he had him. He held him in a mighty tight grip. He held him so tight that it made Brer Rabbit's breath come short like it does off a long journey. He hollered and he begged, but that didn't do any good. He squalled and he cried, but that didn't do any good. He kicked and he groaned, but that didn't do any good. Then Brer Rabbit lay still and studied about what in the name of goodness he was going to do. By and by he up and allowed, ""I don't know what you want with me, Mr. Hawk. I am scarcely a mouthful for you."" Mr. Hawk, he said, ""I'll do away with you, and then I'll go catch me a couple of jay-birds."" This made Brer Rabbit shake all over, because if there was any kind of creature that he despised on the topside of the earth, it was a jay-bird. Brer Rabbit, he said, ""Do pray, Mr. Hawk, go catch those jay-birds first, because I can't stand them being on top of me. I'll stay right here until you come back,"" he said.

Eat Me When I'm Fatter,0122f,The Dog and the Wolf,"Once upon a time there was a peasant family who had a watchdog named Sultan among their household animals. The dog grew old, and, thinking that he could no longer properly attend to to his duties, the peasant chased him away. Dejected and with his head hanging low, the dog left the village, complaining to himself, ""So this is my reward for loyalty at a difficult job. After using up my youthful and energetic years at work, they chase me away and grant me no rest now that I am old and weak."" He sadly went his way, wandering aimlessly about for many days without finding any tolerable shelter. Emaciated and weak from his long journey, he came to a forest. A wolf came out of the forest, ran up to the poor dog, and cried, ""Stop, old fellow! Beware, you are now in my power."" Hearing the wolf speak in this manner, the frightened old Sultan said, ""Dear friend, just take a good look at me, and your appetite for me will disappear. I would make the worst roast you have ever had, for I am nothing but skin and bones. But I do have some advice for you."" The wolf said, ""I don't need any advice from you, you miserable creature. I know what you will say even before you speak, namely that I should let you live. No, I won't change my mind. The long and the short of it is that I am going to eat you."" To this the dog answered, ""I wouldn't think of asking that of you, for I do not want to live any longer. Bite away as long as you want to. But I still have good advice for you. Wouldn't it be better to fatten me up before eating me? You wouldn't loose anything on the feed, because you would get it all back on me. Then I'd make a decent roast. What do you think, Brother Wolf?"" The wolf spoke, ""I'll do it, if the feeding doesn't take too long. Follow me to my hut."" The dog did this, and together they went deeper into the woods. Arriving at the hut, Sultan crept inside, while the wolf went forth to hunt some game for the weak dog. When he returned, he threw his capture to Sultan, who ate it with relish. The next day the wolf came and spoke to the dog, ""Yesterday you ate. Today I will eat."" The dog replied, ""What are you thinking of, dear wolf? I scarcely felt yesterday's food in my stomach."" To be sure, this irritated the wolf, but he had to be happy with going into the woods again to hunt game for the dog. With similar responses, our Sultan put off the wolf as long as he was not strong enough to take on the wolf. The wolf continued to hunt and to bring the dog whatever he captured, eating little or nothing himself so that Sultan would have enough. Thus the dog grew ever stronger, while the opposite was true for the wolf. On the sixth day the wolf came to the dog and spoke, ""I believe that you are ready now."" Sultan answered, ""Yes indeed. To be sure, I feel so well that I will take you on unless you set me free."" The wolf spoke, ""You are joking! Just think, I have been feeding you for six days now, while eating nothing myself. Now am I to go away with nothing? That will never do!"" To this Sultan responded, ""You are partially right, but does that give you the right to eat me up?"" ""That is the right of the strong over the weak,"" answered the wolf. ""Right on!"" replied the dog. ""And thus you have pronounced judgment on yourself."" With these words he made a daring leap, and before the wolf knew it, he was lying on the ground, overpowered by Sultan. ""Because you allowed me to live, I will not kill you immediately, but rather submit your life to fate. Choose two companions, and I will do the same. Tomorrow come to this place in the woods with them, and we will settle our dispute."" The two separated to seek out their fellow warriors. Angrily, the wolf went deeper into the woods. The dog hurried to the nearest village. After much pleading, the wolf got an ill-tempered, grumbling bear and a sly fox to be his comrades. Our Sultan ran first to the parsonage, where he talked a large gray cat into going with him. Then he went to the town judge's barnyard where he found a brave rooster as a second fellow warrior. It was just getting light, and the dog was already underway with his two companions. They had what they needed. He might even surprise his enemies while they were still deep in sleep. The wolf was the first one to awaken. He woke his comrades, then said to the bear, ""You can climb trees, can't you? Be so good as to climb that tall fir tree and see if you can't get a glimpse of our enemies."" The bear did this, and from the top of the tree he cried down, ""Flee! Our enemies are very near, and what powerful enemies they are! One of them is riding proudly along, carrying many sharp sables. They glisten strongly in the morning sun. Another one is walking stealthily after him, pulling a long iron rod behind. Woe unto us!"" The fox was so frightened at these words, that he decided it would be advisable to make himself scarce. The bear hurriedly climbed down from the tree and crept into some thick brush, so that only the tip of his tail was showing. The enemy was now at hand. The wolf, seeing that his friends had deserted him, tried to get away, but Sultan confronted him. One leap, and the dog had the wolf by the back of his neck, and he finished him off. Meanwhile, the cat noticed the tip of the bear's tail moving in the brush. Hoping to catch a mouse, she snapped at it. Terrified, the bear jumped from his hiding place and fled in all haste up a tree, where he thought he would be safe from the enemy. But he was wrong, because the rooster was there as well. Seeing the bear in the tree, the rooster jumped from one branch to the next, always going higher and higher. The bear was beside himself. Terrified, he fell from the tree and lay there stone dead. And thus the battle ended. The news of the brave deeds of Sultan and his companions spread far and wide, also to the village where Sultan had formerly served. As a consequence, the peasant family took back their loyal watchdog and cared for him.",Bohemia,"Source: Theodor Vernaleken, ""Der Hund und der Wolf,"" Österreichische Kinder- und Hausmärchen: Treu nach mündlicher Überlieferung (Vienna and Leipzig: WilhelmBraumüller, 1896), no. 9, pp. 39-43.","The story's final episode is classified as type 104, The War between the Village Animals and the Forest Animals.

Eat Me When I'm Fatter,0122f,The Lambikin,"Once upon a time there was a wee wee lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly. Now one day he set off to visit his granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said, ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll eat YOU!"" But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said, The jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass. By and by he met a vulture, and the vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said, ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll eat YOU!"" But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said, The vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass. And by and by he met a tiger, and then a wolf, and a dog, and an eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said, ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll eat YOU!"" But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk, At last he reached his granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat. So, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn bin at once."" So his granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn bin, and there the greedy little lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender. ""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin. ""You must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."" So his granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the eagle, who called out, And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied, ""How very annoying!"" sighed the eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip. Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing, Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question, And to each of them the little sly-boots replied, Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip. At last the jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out, And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily, But he never got any further, for the jackal recognized his voice at once, and cried, ""Hullo! You've turned yourself inside out, have you? Just you come out of that!""

Eat Me When I'm Fatter,0122f,"The Sheep, the Lamb, the Wolf, and the Hare","""Good morning, Aunty Sheep,"" said the wolf; ""where are you going to?"" ""Oh! Uncle Wolf,"" replied the trembling sheep, ""we are doing no harm; I am just taking my lamb to graze on the rich grass of the great northern plateau."" "" Well,"" said the wolf, "" I am really very sorry for you; but the fact is, I am hungry, and it will be necessary for me to eat you both on the spot."" ""Please, please, Uncle Wolf, don't do that,"" replied the sheep. ""Please don't eat us now; but if you will wait till the autumn, when we shall both be very much fatter than we are now, you can eat us with much more benefit to yourself on our return journey."" The wolf thought this was a good idea. ""Very well, Aunty Sheep,"" said he, ""that is a bargain. I will spare your lives now, but only on condition that you meet me at this very spot on your return journey from the north in the autumn."" So saying, he galloped off, and the sheep and the lamb continued on their way towards the north, and soon forgot all about their encounter with the wolf. All the summer they grazed about on the succulent grass of the great plateau, and when autumn was approaching both were as fat as fat could be, and the little lamb had grown into a fine young sheep. When the time came for returning to the south, the sheep remembered her bargain with the wolf, and every day as they drew farther and farther south she grew more and more downhearted. One day, as they were approaching the place where they had met the wolf, it chanced that a hare came hopping along the road towards them. The hare stopped to say good morning to the sheep, and noticing that she was looking very sad, he said, ""Good-morning, Sister Sheep, how is it that you, who are so fat and have so fine a lamb, are looking so sad this morning?"" ""Oh! Brother Hare,"" replied the sheep, ""mine is a very sad story. The fact is that last spring, as I and my lamb were coming up this very road, we met an ugly- looking wolf, who said he was going to eat us; but I begged him to spare our lives, explaining to him that we should both be much larger and fatter in the autumn, and that he would get much better value from us if he waited till then. The wolf agreed to this, and said that we must meet him at the same spot in the autumn. We are now very near the appointed place, and I very much fear that in another day or two we shall both be killed by the wolf."" So saying, the poor sheep broke down altogether and burst into tears. ""Dear me! Dear me!"" replied the hare. ""This is indeed a sad story; but cheer up, Sister Sheep, you may leave it to me, and I think I can answer for it that I know how to manage the wolf."" So saying, the hare made the following arrangements. He dressed himself up in his very best clothes, in a new robe of woolen cloth, with a long earring in his left ear, and a fashionable hat on his head, and strapped a small saddle on to the back of the sheep. He then prepared two small bundles, which he slung across the lamb, and tied them on with a rope. When these preparations were complete, he took a large sheet of paper in his hand, and, with a pen thrust behind his ear, he mounted upon the back of the sheep, and the little procession started off down the path. Soon after, they arrived at the place where they were to meet the wolf, and sure enough there was the wolf waiting for them at the appointed spot. As soon as they came within earshot of where the wolf was standing the hare called out in a sharp tone of authority, ""Who are you, and what are you doing there?"" ""I am the wolf,"" was the reply; "" and I have come here to eat this sheep and its lamb, in accordance with a regular arrangement. Who may you be, pray?"" ""I am Lomden, the hare,"" that animal replied, ""and I have been deputed to India on a special mission by the Emperor of China. And, by the way, I have a commission to bring ten wolf skins as a present to the King of India. What a fortunate thing it is that I should have met you here! Your skin will do for one, anyway."" So saying, the hare produced his sheet of paper, and, taking his pen in his hand, he wrote down the figure ""1"" very large. The wolf was so frightened on hearing this that he turned tail and fled away ignominiously; while the sheep and the lamb, after thanking the hare heartily for his kind offices, continued their journey safely to their own home.",Tibet,"Source: W.

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,How Eulenspiegel Painted the Forbears of the Landgrave of Hessen,"Then inquired the landgrave of Eulenspiegel, what manner of man he was and what he could do. Then answered Eulenspiegel, and said: ""Lord, I know the arts, and that manner of man am I, and your humble servant."" Thereat rejoiced the landgrave greatly, for he thought that Eulenspiegel was an alchymist, and in alchymy had the landgrave much delight. Then spake he unto him, saying: ""Art thou an alchymist?"" And Eulenspiegel answered: ""Nay, that am I not, in good sooth, for of dross make not I gold, but rather quite the other thing. Yet am I a painter, the equal unto whom can be nowhere found in any country, for my work is far better than the work of any other painter."" Then said the landgrave: ""Come, let us now look upon some of thy work."" And Eulenspiegel said: ""Yea, my lord."" And he had with him some paintings cunningly devised, the which he had brought out of Flanders. These took he from his wallet, and displayed them before that prince. These pleased the lord much, and he said unto Eulenspiegel: ""Worshipful sir painter, what money will ye have if that ye would paint on the wall of our castle hall the story of the family of the landgraves of Hessen, and how that through them I became friendly unto and with the King of Hungary, and other lords and princes, and how long the land of Hessen hath been established? And that must ye tell me in the wise that will be most costly and precious."" Then answered Eulenspiegel: ""Behold, most gracious prince, if that ye would have it so rarely done, it might truly cost not less than four hundred marks."" Then answered the landgrave, and said unto Eulenspiegel: ""Master, an if you do but make it rarely, the money shall not fail, nor will we forget to reward thee as ye shall deserve."" Then did Eulenspiegel consent to become the painter of the picture; and thereat gave the landgrave unto Eulenspiegel one hundred marks so that he might buy colours therewith. But when that Eulenspiegel came with three servants he had found, to see what the work was which was to be done, he gat him unto the landgrave, and spake unto him, and entreated him, saying: ""Behold, noble prince, I would crave a grace from ye, which I would ask that ye should grant unto me."" Then spake the landgrave: ""Yea, that I will grant thee. Speak on."" And Eulenspiegel answered, and said: ""The grace I crave from thee is, that, while my work is going forward, no one shall enter without that they ask of me whether they may enter therein."" And therewith the landgrave granted Eulenspiegel the grace he desired. Then conferred Eulenspiegel with his men, and said unto them, that they must take an oath unto him not to betray him; and so did they. And he said unto them, that they need not do any kind of labour, but they might play at tables and chess and other merry pastimes. And thereat were the men content; nor was it greatly marvellous that in such wise they should be, for Eulenspiegel did promise to pay them for serving him after this manner. Then it came to pass, after some three or four weeks had gone by, that the landgrave craved much to see in what measure the painting of Eulenspiegel was ready, and whether, of a truth, it did resemble the ensamples which Eulenspiegel had shewn unto him, which were so goodly and fair. Thereat gat he him to Eulenspiegel, and said unto him: ""Alas, most worshipful master, I would fain come into the hall and see in what measure my picture doth grow ready."" Then Eulenspiegel spake unto the landgrave, and answered him, and said: ""Yea, and that shall ye also do. But I must tell unto thee a marvellous secret which doth touch all my painting, in that no one, if he be ignobly born, or not according unto the ordinance of Holy Church, can behold my painting to see it."" The landgrave said thereafter: ""Truly that is a marvellous thing."" Yet, my masters, ye may perceive in that the landgrave was an alchymist, so had he also more belief in such affairs than cometh unto the lot of all men. And then went he with Eulenspiegel into the hall, and there had Eulenspiegel hanged up a white cloth, that he should have painted. And with a white wand did he point to the wall when that he had with his hand put the cloth somewhat aside, and then spake he to the landgrave, and said unto him: ""Most noble landgrave, look upon this painting, so marvellous well done and with fair colours, and behold here in this corner he that was first lord of Hessen and earl of the land. And here perceive ye one that was an earl of Rome there unto, and he had a princess and a wife, who was duchess of Bavaria and a daughter of the mild and good Justinian, who afterwards became emperor. And look ye, noble lord; of them was born Adolphus. And of Adolphus came William the Swart; and this William had a son Ludwig, who was named the Pious; and so forward until that we come down unto your lordship's grace. And I know well that there is no person living that can reprove my work, so curiously have I made it, and with such fair and goodly colours."" Yet saw the lord nought before his face but the white wall, and he thought unto himself: ""Though I see no thing but the wall, yet will I say nought unto the master, else will he know full well that L am not nobly born, but basely and vilely."" Therefore said the landgrave unto Eulenspiegel: ""Learned and cunning master painter, your work pleaseth me marvellously well, yet is my understanding very small therein."" Therefore departed he out of the hall. And when that he did come unto the princess his wife, she spake unto him, and asked him, saying: ""How goeth it with the master painter? Ye have seen his work and devices, and how are ye pleased therewith? Truly have I but small belief in him; for he seemeth unto me a rare and most cunning knave and beguiler."" And the landgrave answered her: ""I have shrewd trust in him; and therein is displayed great cunning and mastery; I like it well. Would it please thee also to look thereon?"" And she said: ""Yea, that it would."" And the landgrave said: ""Then, with the master's consent, shall ye do it."" Then sent she for Eulenspiegel, and said unto him, that she did desire to behold his painting. And that did Eulenspiegel grant unto her; but he told her likewise the marvellous secret which did hang upon his painting. And they entered in, and with the princess came eight maidens of her women and her woman-fool, which did everywhere be in her company. And Eulenspiegel put back the cloth with his hand, and with his wand told them the same story which he had told unto the landgrave. Yet perceived they nothing; but being ashamed, spake not any word, neither praising nor blaming the picture. But then did the woman-fool open her mouth, and spake, and said unto Eulenspiegel: ""Worshipful master, an if it be that I am basely born, yet see I no thing of thy device upon the wall."" And Eulenspiegel thought: ""Now goeth the matter not so rarely on as before; for if the fools speak truth, then truly must I depart hence,"" and laughed thereat within himself. Thereafter departed the princess, and went unto her lord and husband, and he spake unto her, and asked her how that the work liked [pleased] her. And she answered and said: ""Most gracious lord, it liketh me as well as it did you, and truly is most rare. But my woman-fool it liketh not; and she saith that she cannot see any painting there at all. And she and my maidens think that there lieth hid some knavish practice therein."" Thereat began the landgrave to take counsel within himself, if it might be that he was beguiled; but he sent word unto Eulenspiegel that he should make ready his work, for that all his court was coming to behold the picture, and that if any among them fortuned to be base-born, then should their lands be escheated unto the landgrave. Thereat gat him Eulenspiegel unto his fellows and discharged them, and gave them money, and they departed. And then went he unto the treasurer, and of him gat he other hundred marks; and then went he forth from the castle, and so departed on his way. And it came to pass that on the morrow the landgrave demanded where that his painter might be -- but he had departed. Thereat went he with all his lords into the hall where that the master had exercised his cunning device, but there saw they no painting; so they spake no words, but kept their mouths shut. Thereat said the landgrave, for he beheld the sign which Eulenspiegel did always write where that he had worked any knavery, which was that he wrote up the device of an owl [Eule] and a glass [Spiegel]: ""Now do we know that we are be guiled; and with Eulenspiegel have we but little for to be moved, but rather for the two hundred marks, but the loss thereof can we likewise bear. But a great knave is he, and must henceforth remain far from our lands."" Thus did our noble Master Eulenspiegel everywhere teach wisdom unto the lieges; but from Marburg had he gat him forth, nor would he again have to do with the painter's mastery.",Germany,"Source: The Marvellous Adventures and Rare Conceits of Master Tyll Owlglass [Till Eulenspiegel], newly collected, chronicled and set forth in our English tongue by Kenneth R.

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Many years ago there lived an emperor who loved beautiful new clothes so much that he spent all his money on being finely dressed. His only interest was in going to the theater or in riding about in his carriage where he could show off his new clothes. He had a different costume for every hour of the day. Indeed, where it was said of other kings that they were at court, it could only be said of him that he was in his dressing room! One day two swindlers came to the emperor's city. They said that they were weavers, claiming that they knew how to make the finest cloth imaginable. Not only were the colors and the patterns extraordinarily beautiful, but in addition, this material had the amazing property that it was to be invisible to anyone who was incompetent or stupid. ""It would be wonderful to have clothes made from that cloth,"" thought the emperor. ""Then I would know which of my men are unfit for their positions, and I'd also be able to tell clever people from stupid ones."" So he immediately gave the two swindlers a great sum of money to weave their cloth for him. They set up their looms and pretended to go to work, although there was nothing at all on the looms. They asked for the finest silk and the purest gold, all of which they hid away, continuing to work on the empty looms, often late into the night. ""I would really like to know how they are coming with the cloth!"" thought the emperor, but he was a bit uneasy when he recalled that anyone who was unfit for his position or stupid would not be able to see the material. Of course, he himself had nothing to fear, but still he decided to send someone else to see how the work was progressing. ""I'll send my honest old minister to the weavers,"" thought the emperor. He's the best one to see how the material is coming. He is very sensible, and no one is more worthy of his position than he. So the good old minister went into the hall where the two swindlers sat working at their empty looms. ""Goodness!"" thought the old minister, opening his eyes wide. ""I cannot see a thing!"" But he did not say so. The two swindlers invited him to step closer, asking him if it wasn't a beautiful design and if the colors weren't magnificent. They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister opened his eyes wider and wider. He still could see nothing, for nothing was there. ""Gracious"" he thought. ""Is it possible that I am stupid? I have never thought so. Am I unfit for my position? No one must know this. No, it will never do for me to say that I was unable to see the material."" ""You aren't saying anything!"" said one of the weavers. ""Oh, it is magnificent! The very best!"" said the old minister, peering through his glasses. ""This pattern and these colors! Yes, I'll tell the emperor that I am very satisfied with it!"" ""That makes us happy!"" said the two weavers, and they called the colors and the unusual pattern by name. The old minister listened closely so that he would be able say the same things when he reported back to the emperor, and that is exactly what he did. The swindlers now asked for more money, more silk, and more gold, all of which they hid away. Then they continued to weave away as before on the empty looms. The emperor sent other officials as well to observe the weavers' progress. They too were startled when they saw nothing, and they too reported back to him how wonderful the material was, advising him to have it made into clothes that he could wear in a grand procession. The entire city was alive in praise of the cloth. ""Magnifique! Nysseligt! Excellent!"" they said, in all languages. The emperor awarded the swindlers with medals of honor, bestowing on each of them the title Lord Weaver. The swindlers stayed up the entire night before the procession was to take place, burning more than sixteen candles. Everyone could see that they were in a great rush to finish the emperor's new clothes. They pretended to take the material from the looms. They cut in the air with large scissors. They sewed with needles but without any thread. Finally they announced, ""Behold! The clothes are finished!"" The emperor came to them with his most distinguished cavaliers. The two swindlers raised their arms as though they were holding something and said, ""Just look at these trousers! Here is the jacket! This is the cloak!"" and so forth. ""They are as light as spider webs! You might think that you didn't have a thing on, but that is the good thing about them."" ""Yes,"" said the cavaliers, but they couldn't see a thing, for nothing was there. ""Would his imperial majesty, if it please his grace, kindly remove his clothes."" said the swindlers. ""Then we will fit you with the new ones, here in front of the large mirror."" The emperor took off all his clothes, and the swindlers pretended to dress him, piece by piece, with the new ones that were to be fitted. They took hold of his waist and pretended to tie something about him. It was the train. Then the emperor turned and looked into the mirror. ""Goodness, they suit you well! What a wonderful fit!"" they all said. ""What a pattern! What colors! Such luxurious clothes!"" ""The canopy to be carried above your majesty awaits outside,"" said the grandmaster of ceremonies. ""Yes, I am ready!"" said the emperor. ""Don't they fit well?"" He turned once again toward the mirror, because it had to appear as though he were admiring himself in all his glory. The chamberlains who were to carry the train held their hands just above the floor as if they were picking up the train. As they walked they pretended to hold the train high, for they could not let anyone notice that they could see nothing. The emperor walked beneath the beautiful canopy in the procession, and all the people in the street and in their windows said, ""Goodness, the emperor's new clothes are incomparable! What a beautiful train on his jacket. What a perfect fit!"" No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid. None of the emperor's clothes had ever before received such praise. ""But he doesn't have anything on!"" said a small child. ""Good Lord, let us hear the voice of an innocent child!"" said the father, and whispered to another what the child had said. ""A small child said that he doesn't have anything on!"" Finally everyone was saying, ""He doesn't have anything on!"" The emperor shuddered, for he knew that they were right, but he thought, ""The procession must go on!"" He carried himself even more proudly, and the chamberlains walked along behind carrying the train that wasn't there.",Denmark,"Source: Hans Christian Andersen, Keiserens nye klæder (1837).

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,The Invisible Cloth,"Now the king was much pleased at this, thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not, and so be enabled to increase his treasures, for among the Moors only legitimate children inherit their father's property; and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth. And these men, in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him, agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured, which satisfied the king. When they were supplied with a large quantity of gold, silver, silk, and many other things, they entered the palace, and, putting their looms in order, gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth. After some days, one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced, that it was the most curious thing in the world, describing the design and construction; he then prayed the king to favor them with a visit, but begged he would come alone. The king was much pleased, but wishing to have the opinion of some one first, sent the lord chamberlain to see it, in order to know if they were deceiving him. When the lord chamberlain saw the workmen, and heard all they had to say, he dared not admit he could not see the cloth, and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it; the king sent yet another, who gave the same report. When they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself. On entering the palace and seeing the men at work, who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and color, in which they all appeared to agree, although in reality they were not working; when the king saw how they appeared to work, and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described, and yet could not see it, although those he had sent had seen it, he began to feel very uneasy, fearing he might not be the son of the king, who was supposed to be his father, and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom; under this impression he commenced praising the fabric, describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen. On the return to his palace he related to his people how good and marvelous was the cloth, yet at the same time suspected something wrong. At the end of two or three days the king requested his Alguacil (or officer of justice) to go and see the cloth. When the Alguacil entered and saw the workmen, who, as before, described the figures and pattern of the cloth, knowing that the king had been to see it, and yet could not see it himself, he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father, and therefore could not see it. He, however, feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honorable position; to avoid this mischance he commenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others. When the Alguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth, and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world, the king was much disconcerted; for he thought that if the Alguacil had seen the cloth, which he was unable to see, there could no longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king, as was generally supposed, he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it. On another day he sent one of his councillors, and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom I have spoken; and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the king and many others, for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth. Things went on thus until there came a great feast, when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth; so the workmen, being ordered, brought some rolled up in a very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut off; so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up. Now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king, informing his majesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed, the king all this time not daring to say he could not see it. When the king had professed to dress himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city; but fortunately for him it was summertime. The people seeing his majesty come in this manner were much surprised; but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers, kept their surprise to themselves, fearing the dishonor consequent upon such a declaration. Not so, however, with a negro, who happened to notice the king thus equipped; for he, having nothing to lose, came to him and said, ""Sire, to me it matters not whose son I am, therefore I tell you that you are riding without any clothes."" On this the king commenced beating him, saying that he was not the legitimate son of his supposed father, and therefore it was that he could not see the cloth. But no sooner had the negro said this, than others were convinced of its truth, and said the same; until, at last, the king and all with him lost their fear of declaring the truth, and saw through the trick of which these impostors had made them the victims. When the weavers were sought for they were found to have fled, taking with them all they had received from the king by their imposition.",Spain,"Source: Don Juan Manuel, Count Lucanor; or, The Fifty Pleasant Stories of Patronio, written by the Prince Don Juan Manuel and first done into English by James York, M.D., 1869 (London: Gibbings and Company, 1899), chapter 7, pp. 52-58.","Andersen knew this story through a German translation ""So ist der Lauf der Welt (""Such Is the Way of the World""), in: Eduard von Bülow, Das Novellenbuch, vol. 4 (Leipzig: F.

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,The Invisible Silk Robe,"A Brahman wrote seven stanzas in praise of his king's copper-colored silk robes. Seven men heard these stanzas and resolved to trick a foolish king from another city. Traveling to that city, the seven men said to the king, ""Maharaja, what sort of robe is your majesty wearing? We have woven a copper-colored silk robe for the king of our city. It is like the thin silk robes from the divine world. In comparison to our king, you look like one of his servants."" Thus spoke the seven men. These words brought shame to the king. Thus filled with shame, he thought to himself, ""I too am a king. Can I not have such robes woven for me as well?"" Then he asked, ""What would you require to weave such silk robes?"" The seven men replied, ""You must obtain good silk thread and give it to us. Then construct for us a place in your festival garden and provide us with food and drink."" Then they added, ""The silk cloth that we weave is not visible to a low-born person; only a well-born person can see it."" So the king procured silk thread for the men. The men took it to the festival garden and put it away. People came to the festival garden to look at the copper-colored silk robe. The seven men were there at work. The people could see their motions of weaving, cutting, and stitching, but the silk robe itself was not visible. Hence each man thought to himself, ""I must be low-born, for I cannot see this copper-colored silk robe."" And what if these were their thoughts! Each person kept them to himself, and no one uttered them aloud. The king sent a messenger to see if the robe was finished. He saw the seven men's motions of weaving and stitching, but the robe itself was not visible. ""If I report that I did not see the robe, they will say that I am the son of a courtesan,"" he thought. To hide his shame, the messenger returned to the royal house and said, ""The men are weaving a priceless robe, but the work is not yet finished. Once finished, they will dress your honor in the robe."" Because of the messenger's statement, many people went to look at the robe, but in spite of the workers' motions, the robe was not visible to anyone. Fearing that others would call them illegitimate, they all said, ""We see it. It is indeed a very costly robe."" And they went away. After seven days the king himself went to look at the silk robe. He looked, but it was not visible to him either. He uttered not a word that he could not see it. Afterward the seven men came to the king and said, ""We have woven for you the copper-colored silk robe. It is finished."" Then they added, ""Get out all the clothes that you have inherited from seven generations of ancestors. After we have dressed you in the new robe you must give us all those other clothes."" Thus the king took out all the vestments from his ancestors and gave them and all his other clothes to the seven men. After receiving all the clothes, the seven men surrounded the king and told him that they were putting on him the copper-colored silk clothing. They stroked his head, saying that they were putting on the crown. They stroked his arms, saying that they were putting on the jacket. In the same manner they stroked all parts of his body, saying that they were dressing him. Then they brought the king into the middle of a great procession and announced to the citizens, ""Neither his majesty our king, nor any other person within this procession has ever worn or even seen such clothing as this. In celebration of the king's new robe, let him sit atop the festival elephant and be carried throughout the entire city and then back to the royal house!"" Having said this, they brought forth the elephant, seated the naked king upon it, and started him on his procession throughout the city. But the seven men took goods from his house and went away. And the foolish king remained without clothes.",Sri Lanka,"Source: Henry Parker, Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon, volume 2 (London: Luzac and Company, 1914), no. 89, pp. 66-69.",This tale is from the northwestern part of Sri Lanka.

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,The King's New Turban,"Of old time there was a great king. One day a man came before him and said, ""My king, I shall weave a turban such that one born in wedlock will see it, while the bastard will see it not."" The king marveled and ordered that that weaver should weave that turban; and the weaver received an allowance from the king and tarried a long while. One day he folded up this side and that side of a paper and brought it and laid it before the king and said, ""Oh king, I have woven that turban."" So the king opened the paper and saw that there was nothing; and all the viziers and nobles who stood there looked on the paper and saw nothing. Then the king said in his heart, ""Do you see? I am then a bastard""; and he was sad. And he thought, ""Now, the remedy is this, that I say it is a goodly turban and admire it, else will I be put to shame before the folk."" And he said, ""Blessed by God! Oh master, it is a goodly turban, I like it much."" Then that weaver youth said, ""Oh king, let them bring a cap that I may wind the turban for the king."" They brought a cap, and the weaver youth laid that paper before him and moved his hands as though he wound the turban, and he put it on the king's head. All the nobles who were standing there said, ""Blessed be it! Oh king, how fair, how beautiful a turban!"" and they applauded it much. Then the king rose and went with two viziers into a private room and said, ""Oh viziers, I am then a bastard; I see not the turban."" The viziers said, ""Oh king, we too see it not."" At length they knew of a surety that the turban had not existence, and that that weaver had thus played a trick for the sake of money.

The Emperor's New Clothes,1620,The King and the Clever Girl,"There was once a king who, during the day, used to sit on his throne and dispense justice, but who at night was accustomed to disguise himself and to wander about the streets of his city looking for adventures. One evening he was passing by a certain garden when he observed four young girls sitting under a tree, and conversing together in earnest tones. Curious to overhear the subject of their discourse, he stopped to listen. One of the girls said, ""I think of all tastes the pleasantest in the world is the taste of telling lies."" This remark so interested the king that the next day he summoned the girl to his palace. ""Tell me,"" he said, ""what you and your companions talked about under the tree last night."" ""It was not about the king,"" answered she. ""Nevertheless,"" asked he, ""what was it you said?"" ""Those who tell lies, said I, must tell them because they find the practice agreeable,"" replied she. ""Whose daughter are you?"" inquired the king. ""I am the daughter of a farmer,"" answered the girl. ""And what made you think there was pleasure in telling lies?"" asked the king. The girl answered saucily, ""Oh, you yourself will tell lies someday!"" ""How?"" said the king. ""What can you mean?"" The girl answered, ""If you will give me two lacs of rupees, and six months to consider, I will promise to prove my words."" So the king gave the girl the sum of money she asked for, and agreed to her conditions. After six months he called her to his presence again, and reminded her of her promise. Now, in the interval the girl had built a fine palace far away in the forest, upon which she had expended the wealth which the king had given to her. It was beautifully adorned with carvings and paintings, and furnished with silk and satin. So she now said to the king, ""Come with me, and you shall see God."" Taking with him two of his ministers, the king went out, and by the evening they all arrived at the palace. ""This palace is the abode of God,"" said the girl. ""But he will reveal himself only to one person at a time, and he will not reveal himself even to him unless he was born in lawful wedlock. Therefore, while the rest remain without, let each of you enter in order."" ""Be it so,"" said the king. ""But let my ministers precede me. I shall go in last."" So the first minister passed through the door and at once found himself in a noble room, and as he looked around he said to himself, ""Who knows whether I shall be permitted to see God or not? I may be a bastard. And yet this place, so spacious and so beautiful, is a fitting dwelling place even for the deity."" With all his looking and straining, however, he quite failed to see God anywhere. Then said he to himself, ""If now I go out and declare that I have not seen God, the king and the other minister will throw it in my teeth that I am base-born. I have only one course open, therefore, which is to say that I have seen him."" So he went out, and when the king asked, ""Have you seen God?"" he answered at once, ""Of course I have seen God."" ""But have you really seen him?"" continued the king. ""Really and truly,"" answered the minister. ""And what did he say to you?"" inquired the king further. ""God commanded me not to divulge his words,"" readily answered the minister. Then said the king to the other minister, ""Now you go in."" The second minister lost no time in obeying his master's order, thinking in his heart as he crossed the threshold, ""I wonder if I am base-born?"" Finding himself in the midst of the magnificent chamber, he gazed about him on all sides, but failed to see God. Then said he to himself, ""It is very possible I am base-born, for no God can I see. But it would be a lasting disgrace that I should admit it. I had better make out that I also have seen God."" Accordingly, he returned to the king, who said to him, ""Well, have you seen God?"" when the minister asserted that he had not only seen him, but that he had spoken with him too. It was now the turn of the king, and he entered the room confident that he would be similarly favored. But he gazed around in dismay, perceiving no sign of anything which could even represent the Almighty. Then began he to think to himself, ""This God, wherever he is, has been seen by both my ministers, and it cannot be denied, therefore, that their birthright is clear. Is it possible that I, the king, am a bastard, seeing that no God appears to me? The very thought is confusion, and necessity will compel me to assert that I have seen him too."" Having formed this resolution, the king stepped out and joined the rest of his party. ""And now, O king,"" asked the cunning girl, ""have you also seen God?"" ""Yes,"" answered he with assurance, ""I have seen God."" ""Really?"" asked she again. ""Certainly,"" asserted the king. Three times the girl asked the same question, and three times the king unblushingly lied. Then said the girl, ""O king, have you never a conscience? How could you possibly see God, seeing that God is a spirit?"" Hearing this reproof, the king recalled to mind the saying of the girl that one day he would lie too, and, with a laugh, he confessed that he had not seen God at all. The two ministers, beginning to feel alarmed, confessed the truth as well. Then said the girl, ""O king, we poor people may tell lies occasionally to save our lives, but what had you to fear? Telling lies, therefore, for many has its own attractions, and to them at least the taste of lying is sweet."" Far from being offended at the stratagem which the girl had practiced on him, the king was so struck with her ingenuity and assurance that he married her forthwith, and in a short time she became his confidential adviser in all his affairs, public as well as private.

End of the World,2033,Brother Rabbit Takes Some Exercise,"One night while the little boy was sitting in Uncle Remus's cabin, waiting for the old man to finish his hoe-cake, and refresh his memory as to the further adventures of Brother Rabbit, his friends and his enemies, something dropped upon the top of the house with a noise like the crack of a pistol. The little boy jumped, but Uncle Remus looked up and exclaimed, ""Ah-yi!"" in a tone of triumph. ""What was that, Uncle Remus?"" the child asked, after waiting a moment to see what else would happen. ""New from Jack Frost, honey. When that hickory-nut tree out there hears him coming, she begins to drop what she's got. I'm mighty glad,"" he continued, scraping the burnt crust from hi hoe-cake with an old case-knife. ""I'm mighty glad hickory nuts aren't as big and heavy as grindstones."" He waited a moment to see what effect this queer statement would have on the child. ""Yes, sir, I'm might glad, that I am. Because if hickory nuts were as big as grindstones, this here old calaboose would be leaking long before Christmas."" Just then another hickory nut dropped upon the roof, and the little boy jumped again. This seemed to amuse Uncle Remus, and he laughed until he was near to choking himself with his smoking hoe-cake. ""You are doing exactly what old Brer Rabbit did, I declare to gracious if you aren't,"" the old man cried, as soon as he could get his breath. ""Exactly for the world."" The child was immensely flattered, and at once he wanted to know how Brother Rabbit did. Uncle Remus was in such good humor that he needed no coaxing. He pushed his spectacles back on he forehead, wiped him mouth on his sleeve, and began: It came about that early one morning towards the fall of the year Brer Rabbit was stirring around in the woods after some bergamot to use for making him some hair grease. The wind was blowing so cold that it made him feel right frisky, and every time he heard the bushes rattle, it seemed to scare him. He was going on this way, hoppity-skippity, when by and by he heard Mr. Man cutting on a tree way off in the woods. He sat up, Brer Rabbit did, and listened first with one ear and then with the other. The man, he cut and cut, and Brer Rabbit, he listened and listened. By and by, while all this was going on, down came the tree: kubber-lang-bang-blam! Brer Rabbit, he took and jumped just like you jumped, and not only that, he made a break, he did, and he leaped out of as though the dogs were after him. ""Was he scared, Uncle Remus?"" asked the little boy. ""Scared! Who? Him? Shoo! Don't you fret yourself about Brer Rabbit, honey. In those days there was nothing going that could scare Brer Rabbit. To be sure, he took care of himself, and if you know anyone who refuses to take care of himself, I would mighty well like you to point him out. Indeed I would!"" Uncle Remus seemed to boil over wit argumentative indignation. Well then, he continued, Brer Rabbit ran until he sort of got heated up, and about the time he was getting ready to squat and catch his wind, who should he meet but Brer Coon going home after sitting up with old Brer Bull-Frog. Brer Coon saw him running, and he hailed him, ""What's your hurry, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Haven't got time to tarry."" ""Folks sick?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Trying out your suppleness?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Do pray, Brer Rabbit, tell me the news!"" ""Mighty big fuss back there in the woods. Haven't got time to tarry!"" This made Brer Coon feel might skittish, because he was far from home, and he just leaped out, he did, and he went a-boiling through the woods. Brer Coon hadn't gone far until he met Brer Fox. ""Hey, Brer Coon, where are you going?"" ""Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Going to the doctor?"" ""No, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry!"" Do pry, Brer Coon, tell me the news."" Mighty queer racket back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry! With that, Brer Fox leaped out, he did, and fairly split the wind. He hadn't gone far until he met Brer Wolf. ""Hey, Brer Fox! Stop and rest yourself!"" ""Haven't got time to tarry!"" ""Who is wanting the doctor?"" ""No one, my Lord! Haven't got time to tarry."" ""Do pray, Brer Fox, good or bad, tell me the news."" ""Mighty curious fuss back there in the woods! Haven't got time to tarry!"" With that, Brer Wolf shook himself loose from the face of the earth, and he didn't get far until he met Brer Bear. Brer Bear, he asked, and Brer Wolf made an answer, and by and by Brer Bear snorted and ran off. And, bless gracious, it wasn't long before the last one of the creatures was a-skaddling through the woods as though the Old Boy were after them, and all because Brer Rabbit heard Mr. Man cut a tree down. They ran and they ran, Uncle Remus went on, until they them to Brer Terrapin's house, and they sort of slacked up, because they had nearly lost their wind. Brer Terrapin, he up an asked them where they were going, and they said there was a monstrous, terrifying racket back there in the woods. Brer Terrapin, he asked what it sounded like. One said he didn't know; the other said he didn't know; and they all said they didn't know. This made old Brer Terrapin laugh way down in his insides, and he up and said, ""You all can run along if you feel skittish,"" he said. ""After I cook my breakfast and wash up the dishes, and if I get wind of any suspicious racket, maybe I might just take down my parasol and follow along after you,"" he said. When the creatures came to ask one another about who started the news, it went right back to Brer Rabbit, but low and behold, Brer Rabbit wasn't there! It turned out that Brer Coon was the one who had seen him last. Then they got to laying the blame of it on one or the other, until they almost began to fight, but then old Brer Terrapin, he up and said that if they wanted to straighten it out, they'd better go see Brer Rabbit. All the creatures agreed, the they started out for Brer Rabbit's house. When they got there, Brer Rabbit was sitting cross-legged on the front porch winking his eyes at the sun. Brer Bear spoke up, ""What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Fool who, Brer Bear?"" ""Me, Brer Rabbit, that's who."" ""This is the first time I've seen you today, Brer Bear, and you are more than welcome at that."" They all asked him and got the same answer, and then Brer Coon put in, ""What made you fool me, Brer Rabbit?"" ""How did I fool you, Brer Coon?"" ""You made like there was a big racket, Brer Rabbit."" ""What kind of a racket, Brer Rabbit?"" ""Ah-yi! You should have asked me that first, Brer Coon."" ""I'm asking you now, Brer Rabbit."" ""Mr. Man cut a tree down, Brer Coon."" Of course this made Brer Coon feel like a natural-born slink, and it wasn't long before all the creatures made their bows to Brer Rabbit and moseyed off home. ""Brother Rabbit had the best of it all along,"" said the little boy, after waiting to see whether there was a sequel to the story. ""Oh, did he ever!"" exclaimed Uncle Remus. ""Brer Rabbit was a mighty man in those days.""",African American,"Source: Joel Chandler Harris, Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1883), no. 20, pp. 108-13.",NA,Dialect normalized by D.

So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole. Now this was the door of Foxy-Woxy's cave. But Foxy-Woxy said to Henny-Penny, Cocky-Locky, Ducky-Daddles, Goosey-Poosey, and Turkey-Lurkey: ""This is the short way to the king's palace; you'll soon get there if you follow me. I will go first and you come after, Henny-Penny, Cocky-Locky, Ducky-Daddles, Goosey-Poosey, and Turkey-Lurkey.""

So Foxy-Woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far but turned round to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-Locky, Ducky-Daddles, Goosey-Poosey, and Turkey-Lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-Lurkey went through the dark hole into the cave. He hadn't got far when ""Hrumph,"" Foxy-Woxy snapped off Turkey-Lurkey's head and threw his body over his left shoulder. Then Goosey-Poosey went in, and ""Hrumph,"" off went her head and Goosey-Poosey was thrown beside Turkey-Lurkey.

Then Cocky-Locky strutted down into the cave and he hadn't gone far when ""Snap, Hrumph!"" went Foxy-Woxy and Cocky-Locky was thrown alongside of Turkey-Lurkey, Goosey-Poosey and Ducky-Daddles. But Foxy-Woxy had made two bites at Cocky-Locky, and when the first snap only hurt Cocky-Locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to Henny-Penny.

End of the World,2033,The Cock and the Hen That Went to Dovrefjell,"Once upon a time there was a hen that had flown up and perched on an oak tree for the night. When the night came, she dreamed that unless she got to Dovrefjell, the world would come to an end. So that very minute she jumped down, and set out on her way. When she had walked a bit she met a cock. ""Good day, Cocky-Locky,"" said the hen. ""Good day, Henny-Penny,"" said the cock. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the hen. ""Who told you that, Henny-Penny?"" asked the cock. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the cock. Well, they walked on a good bit, and then they met a duck. ""Good day, Ducky-Lucky,"" said the cock. ""Good day, Cocky-Locky"" said the duck. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""Oh, I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the cock. ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny,"" said the cock. ""Who told you that, Henny-Penny?"" asked the duck. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the duck. So they went off together, and after a bit they met a goose. ""Good day, Goosey-Poosey,"" said the duck. ""Good day, Ducky-Lucky,"" said the goose. ""Where are you going so early?"" ""I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the duck. ""Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"" asked the goose. ""Cocky-Locky."" ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny."" ""How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"" said the goose. ""I sat in the oak and dreamed it last night, Goosey-Poosey,"" said the hen. ""I'll go with you,"" said the goose. Now when they had all walked along for a bit, a fox met them. ""Good day, Foxy-Cocksy,"" said the goose. ""God day, Goosey-Poosey."" ""Where are you going, Foxy-Cocksy?"" ""Where are you going yourself, Goosey-Poosey?"" ""I'm going to Dovrefjell, that the world won't come to an end,"" said the goose. ""Who told you that, Goosey-Poosey?"" asked the fox. ""Ducky-Lucky."" ""Who told you that, Ducky-Lucky?"" ""Cocky-Locky."" ""Who told you that, Cocky-Locky?"" ""Henny-Penny."" ""How do you know that, Henny-Penny?"" ""I sat in the oak and dreamed last night, that if we don't get to Dovrefjell, the world will come to an end,"" said the hen. ""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the fox. ""The world won't come to an end if you don't go there. No, come home with me to my den. That's far better, for it's warm and jolly there."" Well, they went home with the fox to his den, and when they got inside, the fox laid on lots of fuel, so that they all got very sleepy. The duck and the goose, they settled themselves down in a corner, but the cock and hen flew up on a post. So when the goose and duck were well asleep, the fox took the goose and laid him on the embers, and roasted him. The hen smelled the strong roast meat, and sprang up to a higher peg, and said, half asleep, ""Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"" ""Oh, stuff!"" said the fox. ""It's only the smoke driven down the chimney. Go to sleep again, and hold your tongue."" So the hen went off to sleep again. Now the fox had hardly got the goose well down his throat, before he did the very same with the duck. He took and laid him on the embers, and roasted him for a dainty bit. Then the hen woke up again, and sprang up to a higher peg still. ""Phooey, what a nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"" she said again, and when she got her eyes open, and came to see how the fox and eaten two of them, both the goose and the duck. So she flew up to the highest peg of all, and perched there, and peeped up through the chimney. ""Nay, nay, just see what a lovely lot of geese are flying over there,"" she said to the fox. Out ran Reynard to fetch a fat roast. But while he was gone, the hen woke up the cock and told him how it had gone with Goosey-Poosey and Ducky-Lucky. And so Cocky-Locky and Henny-Penny flew out through the chimney, and if they hadn't got to Dovrefjell, it surely would have been all over with the world.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Popular Tales from the North, translated by George Webbe Dasent, new edition (New York: G.

End of the World,2033,The End of the World,"""How do you know, Henny Penny?"" says he. ""Oh, a nut fell on my tail just now."" ""If that be so, we have nothing for it but to run away."" So they ran till they met the duck. ""Oh, Ducky Lucky, the end of the world is come."" ""How do you know, Cocky Locky?"" ""Oh, a nut fell just now on Henny Penny's tail."" ""If that be so, we must run for it."" When they were pegging off, they met the goose. ""Oh, Goosey Poosey, the end of the world is come."" ""How do you know, Ducky Lucky?"" ""A nut fell on Henny Penny's tail just now."" ""If that be the case, we are done for."" They met the fox. ""Oh, Foxy Coxy, the world is come to an end."" ""How do you know that, Goosey Poosey?"" ""Oh, a nut fell on Henny Penny's tail."" ""Then let us be off."" So they got into the wood, and says Foxy Coxy, ""Let me count if all are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; Ducky Lucky, three; Cocky Locky, four; Henny Penny, five. Number five, I'll put you in a safe place where the end of the world won't hurt you."" So he took Henny Penny behind a hush and put her out of pain. ""Now,"" says he, coming back, ""let us count if all the rest are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; etc., etc. Number four, I'll put you in a place where you'll be safe when the end of the world comes."" He took him behind another bush, etc., etc., etc. ""Now let me see if all the rest are here. I, Foxy Coxy, one; etc., etc., etc."" and so on till he put the fear of the world's end out of every one of them. In the yard he passed the house dog who was sitting in front of his kennel. ""Hallo, Chaton!"" cried the dog. ""Where are you going to in such a hurry?"" ""I am fleeing the country,"" answered Chaton. ""I have just heard the sounding of the last trump! The end of the world is at hand!"" ""If that is so,"" said the dog, ""I would like to run away too. May I come with you?"" ""Certainly,"" answered Chaton. ""Seat yourself on my beautiful curly tail."" So the dog perched himself on the cat s tail, and off they went together. A little farther on they came to the farm gate, and there, perched on the topmost rail, was the cock. ""Whither away, Chaton?"" asked the cock. ""You seem to be in haste."" ""Yes,"" said Chaton. ""I have heard the last trump, which proves that the world is coming to an end, and I want to get safely away before that happens."" ""Take me with you, Chaton dear,"" said the cock. ""By all means,"" answered the cat. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail beside the dog."" So the cock perched himself on Chaton's tail, and now there were two passengers. Away went the cat even faster than before, so as to make up for lost time, and presently they passed a rabbit who was nibbling the grass in a field. ""Chaton, Chaton,"" cried the rabbit, ""why are you running so quickly?"" ""Don't stop me!"" answered the cat. ""I've heard the last trump! The end of the world is coming!"" ""Oh, dear me!"" cried the rabbit. ""What an unfortunate thing! Don't leave me here, Chaton, for I am afraid to face the end of the world."" ""Very well,"" said Chaton. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the cock, and I'll take you with me."" So the rabbit also perched himself on the cat's tail, and now there were three of them riding there. Off went the cat again, but not so quickly this time, because of the weight on his tail, and before very long he came to a pond by the side of which a goose was standing. ""Now then, now then, what's the hurry?"" asked the goose. ""If you run so fast you'll overheat your blood and die of a fever."" ""It's all very well to scoff,"" answered the cat, ""but you must know that the end of the world is coming. I have heard the last trump sound!"" ""My goodness!"" said the goose. ""This is dreadful! Take me with you, Chaton, and I'll be grateful for ever."" ""Very well,"" said the cat. ""Jump on to my beautiful curly tail with the dog and the fox and the rabbit."" So the goose also perched herself on the cat's tail, so now there were four passengers, and that made five altogether who were running away to escape the end of the world. All that day the cat kept on running, and towards dusk they came to a forest. ""This seems a good place to rest,"" said Chaton. ""Now then, master cock, fly to the top of a tree and see if you can espy a house in which we can take shelter."" The cock flew to the top of a high tree and from there he saw a number of lights twinkling in the distance. The five fugitives thereupon set off in the direction from which the lights shone, and before long they came to a little village. All the people of the village had left their houses and were gathered together in the square, round a man dressed all in red, with a big red feather in his cap, who was addressing them. Chaton and his companions pressed close to the edge of the crowd and were just in time to hear these words: ""Whoever finds the ring,"" said the man with the red feather,"" and places it on the table in my palace tomorrow before dawn, shall have the five bags of gold which hang on my saddle bow."" Having said this, the man in red mounted his horse and rode away. Chaton went up to a little peasant who was standing in the crowd. ""Tell me, gossip,"" said he, ""who is the man with the red feather, and what's all this about a ring and five bags of gold?"" ""Why,"" said the peasant, ""the man in red is the king of this country. He had a valuable ring which was kept in a tiny wooden case on the table by his bed. This afternoon a magpie flew in through the window, snatched up the case, and bore it away to its nest in the topmost boughs of the walnut tree on the village green. The king wants his ring back again, and will give the five bags of gold to anybody who will recover it for him."" ""I see,"" said Chaton; ""and why don't you climb the walnut tree and get the ring?"" ""Because I have too much respect for my neck,"" answered the peasant, ""and so has everybody else here. The boughs at the top of the tree where the nest is are so thin and slender that they would not bear the weight of a child, let alone a grown man. Gold is good, but whole limbs are better, that's what I say!"" ""And I!"" ""And I!"" echoed other villagers who had been listening to this conversation. ""In my belief you are quite right,"" said Chaton seriously. ""Let the king risk his own life if he is so anxious to recover his ring."" But afterwards, when he had withdrawn with his companions to the shelter of the wood, he sang a different tune. ""My friends,"" said he, ""our fortunes are made! As soon as all is quiet I will climb the tree and get the ring; then you shall sit on my tail again and we'll all go off together to the king's palace and get the bags of gold!"" He danced for joy, and the dog and the cock and the goose and the rabbit danced with him. An hour afterwards the cat climbed the tree and came down safely with the little wooden box. The rabbit gnawed it open with his teeth, and sure enough there was the ring inside it. ""Now,"" said Chaton, ""we will all go to the king's palace, but I am very tired with running all day. I propose that the dog takes a turn at carrying us."" This was agreed. The other four got on to the dog's back and clung there while he ambled off as fast as he could along the road towards the palace. Just before dawn they came to a wide river. Now it was the turn of the goose to work for the common good. She was quite used to the water, and one by one she took the other animals across on her back. Shortly afterwards they arrived at the king's palace, and the cock flew up through the open window of the king's room with the ring in his beak, and placed it on the table by the bed. Then he awoke the king with a loud crow and claimed the reward, which was willingly given. In great glee at their good fortune the animals went on their way, each with his bag of gold, and every one of them had by this time quite forgotten his fear about the coming of the end of the world. They went on and on until they came to a place where five ways met. Then Chaton said, ""Here we are at the parting of the ways. Let us each choose a road, and part good friends."" At this moment there came along a pig with a knife and fork stuck in his back. In his right ear was salt; in his left ear pepper, and mustard was on his tail, so that everybody who was hungry had only to cut themselves a slice of meat and sit down to feast. Our friends gladly availed themselves of this good chance, and I who tell you this story would willingly have done the same, but as soon as I went up to the pig, he ran at me with his head down and sent me flying through the air, and through the window of my house, where I fell into the chair in which I am now sitting, finishing this story of the wonderful adventures of Chaton, the dog, the cock, the rabbit, and the goose.",Ireland Flanders,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, The Fireside Stories of Ireland (Dublin: M'Glashan and Gill, 1870), p. 25.

When it saw the lions running it asked, ""O honored ones, wherefore do ye all run, although each of you is strong in claws and strong in teeth?"" The lions replied, ""There was a loud noise."" ""O honored ones, whence did the noise come?"" it asked. ""We do not know,"" they replied. Then said that lion, ""O honored ones, do not run. Inquiry must be made as to where the noise came from.""

Inasmuch as the noise was caused by the fall of a vilva tree out of that forest into the lake, the lion said, ""O honored ones, be not afraid, for that was only an empty sound."" Consequently they were all tranquillized. And a deity uttered this verse, ""Let not men believe in words. They ought to see everything for themselves.

End of the World,2033,The Timid Hare and the Flight of the Beasts,"Once upon a time when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta [the future Buddha] came to life as a young lion. And when fully grown he lived in a wood. At this time there was near the Western Ocean a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. A certain hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at the foot of a vilva tree. One day this hare, after feeding, came and lay down beneath the young palm tree. And the thought struck him, ""If this earth should be destroyed, what would become of me?"" And at this very moment a ripe vilva fruit fell on a palm leaf. At the sound of it, the hare thought, ""This solid earth is collapsing,"" and starting up he fled, without so much as looking behind him. Another hare saw him scampering off, as if frightened to death, and asked the cause of his panic flight. ""Pray, don't ask me,"" he said. The other hare cried, ""Pray, sir, what is it?"" and kept running after him. Then the hare stopped a moment and without looking back said, ""The earth here is breaking up."" And at this the second hare ran after the other. And so first one and then another hare caught sight of him running, and joined in the chase till one hundred thousand hares all took to flight together. They were seen by a deer, a boar, an elk, a buffalo, a wild ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion, and an elephant. And when they asked what it meant and were told that the earth was breaking up, they too took to flight. So by degrees this host of animals extended to the length of a full league. When the Bodhisatta saw this headlong flight of the animals, and heard the cause of it was that the earth was coming to an end, he thought, ""The earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must be some sound which was misunderstood by them. And if I don't make a great effort, they will all perish. I will save their lives."" So with the speed of a lion he got before them to the foot of a mountain, and lion-like roared three times. They were terribly frightened at the lion, and stopping in their flight stood all huddled together. The lion went in amongst them and asked why there were running away. ""The earth is collapsing,"" they answered. ""Who saw it collapsing?"" he said. ""The elephants know all about it,"" they replied. He asked the elephants. ""We don't know,"" they said, ""the lions know."" But the lions said, ""We don't know, the tigers know."" The tigers said, ""The rhinoceroses know."" The rhinoceroses said, ""The wild oxen know."" The wild oxen, ""the buffaloes."" The buffaloes, ""the elks."" The elks, ""the boars."" The boars, ""the deer."" The deer said, ""We don't know; the hares know."" When the hares were questioned, they pointed to one particular hare and said, ""This one told us."" So the Bodhisatta asked, ""Is it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?"" ""Yes, sir, I saw it,"" said the hare. ""Where,"" he asked, ""were you living, when you saw it?"" ""Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palms mixed with vilva trees. For as I was lying beneath the shade of a palm sapling at the foot of a vilva tree, methought, 'If this earth should break up, where shall I go?' And at that very moment I heard the sound the breaking up of the earth, and I fled."" Thought the lion, ""A ripe vilva fruit evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made a 'thud,' and this hare jumped to the conclusion that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away. I will find out the exact truth about it."" So he reassured the herd of animals, and said, ""I will take the hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out by him. Until I return, do you stay here."" Then placing the hare on his back, he sprang forward with the speed of a lion, and putting the hare down in the palm grove, he said, ""Come, show us the place you meant."" ""I dare not, my lord,"" said the hare. ""Come, don't be afraid,"" said the lion. The hare, not venturing to go near the vilva tree, stood afar off and cried, ""Yonder, sir, is the place of dreadful sound,"" and so saying, he repeated the first stanza: After hearing what the hare said, the lion went to the foot of the vilva tree, and saw the spot where the hare had been lying beneath the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe vilva fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having carefully ascertained that the earth had not broken up, he placed the hare on his back and with the speed of a lion soon came again to the herd of beasts. Then he told them the whole story, and said, ""Don't be afraid."" And having thus reassured the herd of beasts, he let them go. Verily, if it had not been for the Bodhisatta at that time, all the beasts would have rushed into the sea and perished. It was all owing to the Bodhisatta that they escaped death.",India,"Source: The Jataka; or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births, edited by E. B.

Fairies' Hope for Christian Salvation,5050,Salvation for the Neck,"The neck then began to weep bitterly, flung away his harp, and sank down to the bottom. The children went home, and told the whole story to their father, who was the parish priest. He said they were wrong to say so to the neck, and desired them to go immediately back to the river, and console him with the promise of salvation. They did so; and when they came down to the river the Neck was sitting on the water, weeping and lamenting. They then said to him, ""Neck, do not grieve so; our father says that your redeemer liveth also."" The neck then took his harp and played most sweetly, until long after the sun was gone down. The neck in grief flung away his harp and wept, and the priest rode on.

Fairies' Hope for Christian Salvation,5050,The Belated Priest,"Father Stafford was asked, rather late in the day, to make a sick call at a cabin that stood among these fields, at a considerable distance from this road, a cabin from which no lane led either to by-road or public road. He was delayed longer than he expected, and when he was leaving the cabin it was nearly dark. This did not disturb him much. There was a path that led to the road, and he knew he had only to keep a northeasterly direction to come out on it, not far from the village already named. So he went on fearlessly for some time, but complete obscurity soon surrounded him, and he would have been sorely perplexed, had it not been that the path lay for the most part beside the fences. At last, instead of passing in a line near the fence, it struck across the field; and, open his eyes wide as he might, he could hardly distinguish it from the dry, russet-colored grass at each side. Well, he kept his eyes steadily fixed in the due direction, and advanced till he was about the middle of the field, which happened to be a large one. There some case of conscience, or other anxious subject, crossed his mind, and he stopped and fidgeted about, walking restlessly this way and that for a few steps, totally forgetting his present circumstances. Coming at last to some solution of his difficulty, full recollection returned, and he was sensible of being thoroughly ignorant of the direction in which his proper route lay. If he could but get a glimpse of Mount Leinster, it would be all well; but, beyond a few perches, all was in the deepest darkness on every side. He then set off in a straight line, which he knew would bring him to some fence, and perhaps he might find stile or gap for his guidance. He went twice round the field, but, in the confusion of his faculties, he could find no trace of path or pass. He at last half resolved to cross the fence, and go straight on, but the dykes were, for the most part, encumbered with briers, and furze bushes crowned the tops of the steep clay mounds. While he stood perplexed, he heard the rustle of wings or bodies passing swiftly through the air, and a musical voice was heard, ""You will suffer much if you do not find your way. Give us a favorable answer to a question, and you shall be on the road in a few minutes."" The good priest was somewhat awed at the rustle and the voice, but he answered without delay, ""Who are you, and what's your question?"" The same voice replied, ""We are the Chlann Sighe, and wish you to declare that at the last day our lot may not be with Satan. Say that the Savior died for us as well as for you."" ""I will give you a favorable answer, if you can make me a hopeful one. Do you adore and love the Son of God?"" He received no answer but weak and shrill cries, and the rushing of wings, and at once it seemed as if he had shaken off some oppression. The dark clouds had separated, a weak light was shed round where he stood, and he distinguished the path, and an opening in the bushes on the fence. He crossed into the next field, and, following the path, he was soon on the road. In fifteen minutes he was seated at his comfortable fire, and his little round table, covered with books, was at his side.",Ireland,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (London and New York: Macmillan and Company, 1891), pp. 87-89.",NA,NA

Fairies' Hope for Christian Salvation,5050,The First Turf Fire,"""If you will ask St. Patrick the answer to one question,"" said he, ""I will tell you something in return."" ""Well, what is it?"" said the man. ""Tomorrow morning at Mass ask him this question: 'Is there any hope for the fallen angels [fairies]?'"" So the next morning at Mass, at the elevation, the servant called out he had a question he wished to ask (for the celebrant must answer any question put to him that moment). When Mass was over, St. Patrick said, ""Who was that wretched man who called out?"" The servant then told the saint about the little man and his question. Said St. Patrick: ""You may just go and dig your own grave, for when you tell him the answer he will surely kill you, but don't forget to lay the loy and the shovel crosswise over the grave when you have done, for the answer to the little man's question is, 'There is no hope for the fallen angels.'"" Then the man went and dug his grave, and he had just put the loy and shovel over him, when the little red man appeared and asked his question. When he heard the reply he tried to get at the poor servant to kill him, but as he was protected by the cross made by the loy and shovel, he could not touch him. At last he said: ""Well, you have answered my question, and though it is against us, I must tell you something as I promised. Go to the bog and throw up some of the turf on it, and let it dry in the sun, and it will make a good fire for you"" -- and he disappeared. The man got out of the grave then, and he told St. Patrick what the little red man had said, and when they tried they found every word true, and from that day the Irish have used turf for fuel.

Fairies' Hope for Christian Salvation,5050,The Priest's Supper,"On a nice green sod by the river's side were the little fellows dancing in a ring as gaily as may be, with their red caps wagging about at every bound in the moonshine; and so light were these bounds, that the lobes of dew, although they trembled under their feet, were not disturbed by their capering. Thus did they carry on their gambols, spinning round and round, and twirling and bobbing, and diving and going through all manner of figures, until one of them chirped out, And away every one of the fairies scampered off as hard as they could, concealing themselves under the green leaves of the lusmore, where, if their little red caps should happen to peep out, they would only look like its crimson bells; and more hid themselves in the hollow of stones, or at the shady side of brambles, and others under the bank of the river, and in holes and crannies of one kind or another. The fairy speaker was not mistaken; for along the road, which was within view of the river, came Father Horrigan on his pony, thinking to himself that as it was so late he would make an end of his journey at the first cabin he came to. According to this determination, he stopped at the dwelling of Dermod Leary, lifted the latch, and entered with ""My blessing on all here."" I need not say that Father Horrigan was a welcome guest wherever he went, for no man was more pious or better beloved in the country. Now it was a great trouble to Dermod that he had nothing to offer his reverence for supper as a relish to the potatoes which ""the old woman,"" for so Dermod called his wife, though she was not much past twenty, had down boiling in the pot over the fire; he thought of the net which he had set in the river, but as it had been there only a short time, the chances were against his finding a fish in it. ""No matter,"" thought Dermod, ""there can be no harm in stepping down to try, and may be as I want the fish for the priest's supper that one will be there before me."" Down to the river side went Dermod, and he found in the net as fine a salmon as ever jumped in the bright waters of ""the spreading Lee."" But as he was going to take it out, the net was pulled from him, he could not tell how or by whom, and away got the salmon, and went swimming along with the current as gaily as if nothing had happened. Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake which the fish had left upon the water, shining like a line of silver in the moonlight, and then, with an angry motion of his right hand, and a stamp of his foot, gave vent to his feelings by muttering, ""May bitter bad luck attend you night and day for a blackguard schemer of a salmon, wherever you go! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, if there's any shame in you, to give me the slip after this fashion! And I'm clear in my own mind you'll come to no good, for some kind of evil thing or other helped you -- did I not feel it pull the net against me as strong as the devil himself?"" ""That's not true for you,"" said one of the little fairies, who had scampered off at the approach of the priest, coming up to Dermod Leary, with a whole throng of companions at his heels; ""there was only a dozen and a half of us pulling against you."" Dermod gazed on the tiny speaker with wonder, who continued, ""Make yourself noways uneasy about the priest's supper; for if you will go back and ask him one question from us, there will be as fine a supper as ever was put on a table spread out before him in less than no time."" ""I'll have nothing at all to do with you,"" replied Dermod, in a tone of determination; and after a pause he added, ""I'm much obliged to you for your offer, sir, but I know better than to sell myself to you or the like of you for a supper; and more than that, I know Father Horrigan has more regard for my soul than to wish me to pledge it for ever, out of regard to any thing you could put before him -- so there's an end of the matter."" The little speaker, with a pertinacity not to be repulsed by Dermod's manner, continued, ""Will you ask the priest one civil question for us?"" Dermod considered for some time, and he was right in doing so, but he thought that no one could come to harm out of asking a civil question. ""I see no objection to do that same, gentlemen,"" said Dermod; ""but I will have nothing in life to do with your supper, -- mind that."" ""Then,"" said the little speaking fairy, whilst the rest came crowding after him from all parts, ""go and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether our souls will be saved at the last day, like the souls of good Christians; and if you wish us well, bring back word what he says without delay."" Away went Dermod to his cabin, where he found the potatoes thrown out on the table, and his good woman handing the biggest of them all, a beautiful laughing red apple, smoking like a hard-ridden horse on a frosty night, over to Father Horrigan. ""Please your reverence,"" said Dermod, after some hesitation, ""may I make bold to ask your honour one question?"" ""What may that be?"" said Father Horrigan. ""Why, then, begging your reverence's pardon for my freedom, it is, if the souls of the good people are to be saved at the last day?"" ""Who bid you ask me that question, Leary?"" said the priest, fixing his eyes upon him very sternly, which Dermod could not stand before at all. ""I'll tell no lies about the matter, and nothing in life but the truth,"" said Dermod. ""It was the good people themselves who sent me to ask the question, and there they are in thousands down on the bank of the river waiting for me to go back with the answer."" ""Go back by all means,"" said the priest, ""and tell them, if they want to know, to come here to me themselves, and I'll answer that or any other question they are pleased to ask with the greatest pleasure in life."" Dermod accordingly returned to the fairies, who came swarming round about him to hear what the priest had said in reply; and Dermod spoke out among them like a bold man as he was: but when they heard that they must go to the priest, away they fled, some here and more there; and some this way and more that, whisking by poor Dermod so fast and in such numbers, that he was quite bewildered. When he came to himself, which was not for a long time, back he went to his cabin and ate his dry potatoes along with Father Horrigan, who made quite light of the thing; but Dermod could not help thinking it a mighty hard case that his reverence, whose words had the power to banish the fairies at such a rate, should have no sort of relish to his supper, and that the fine salmon he had in the net should have been got away from him in such a manner.",Ireland,"Source: Thomas Crofton Croker, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (London: John Murray, 1834), pp. 22-27.",NA,NA

Fairies' Hope for Christian Salvation,5050,When We Cease to Exist....,"""Yes,"" replied the old lady [the little mermaid's grandmother], ""they must also die, and their term of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live for three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here, we become only foam on the surface of the water and have not even a grave among those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall never live again; like the green seaweed when once it has been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the contrary, have souls which live forever, even after the body has been turned to dust. They rise up through the clear, pure air, beyond the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see."" ""Why have not we immortal souls?"" asked the little mermaid, mournfully. ""I would gladly give all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars."" ""You must not think that,"" said the old woman. ""We believe that we are much happier and much better off than human beings."" ""So I shall die,"" said the little mermaid, ""and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about, never again to hear the music of the waves or to see the pretty flowers or the red sun? Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul?"" ""No,"" said the old woman; ""unless a man should love you so much that you were more to him than his father or his mother, and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the priest placed his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter -- then his soul would glide into your body, and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind.

A Fairy Captured,6010,A Fairy Caught,"I heard last week of three fairies having been seen in Zennor very recently. A man who lived at the foot of Trendreen hill, in the valley of Treridge, I think, was cutting furze on the hill. Near the middle of the day he saw one of the small people, not more than a foot long, stretched at full length and fast asleep, on a bank of griglans (heath), surrounded by high brakes of furze. The man took off his furze cuff, and slipped the little man into it, without his waking up; went down to the house; took the little fellow out of the cuff on the hearthstone, when he awakened, and seemed quite pleased and at home, beginning to play with the children, who were well pleased with the small body, and called him Bobby Griglans. The old people were very careful not to let Bob out of the house, or be seen by the neighbours, as he promised to shew the man where the crocks of gold were buried on the hill. A few days after he was brought from the hill, all the neighbours came with their horses (according to custom) to bring home the winter's reek of furze, which had to be brought down the hill in trusses on the backs of the horses. That Bob might be safe and out of sight, he and the children were shut up in the barn. Whilst the furze-carriers were in to dinner, the prisoners contrived to get out, to have a ""courant"" round the furze-reek, when they saw a little man and woman, not much larger than Bob, searching into every hole and corner among the trusses that were dropped round the unfinished reek. The little woman was wringing her hands and crying, ""Oh, my dear and tender Skillywidden, wherever canst ah (thou) be gone to? Shall I ever cast eyes on thee again?"" ""Go 'e back,"" says Bob to the children. ""My father and mother are come here too."" He then cried out, ""Here I am, mammy!"" By the time the words were out of his mouth, the little man and woman, with their precious Skillywidden, were nowhere to be seen, and there has been no sight nor sign of them since. The children got a sound thrashing for letting Skillywidden escape.",England,"Source (books.google.com): Robert Hunt, Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of Old Cornwall, 2nd series (London: John Camden Hotten, 1865), pp. 265-66.

From the amusement which its strange tricks excited, it became a general favourite in the family, and the good folk really felt very sorry when their strange guest quitted them, which he did in a very unceremonious manner. After the lapse of three or four days, as the little fellow was gamboling about the farm kitchen, a shrill voice from the town-place or farm yard, was heard to call three times, ""Colman Grey!"" at which he sprang up, and gaining voice, cried ""Ho! ho! ho! my daddy is come,"" flew through the key-hole, and was never afterwards heard of.",England,"Source (books.google.com): Thomas Q.

A Fairy Captured,6010,Skillywidden the Fairy,"""Ded 'e ever hear of anybody who ever catched one?"" Jack asked. ""Why ess, and knowed his son too; he was my near neighbour, and lived in Trevidga: he told me all about et."" One day Uncle Billy, his father, was over in the craft, Zennor church-town side of the hill, cuttan away down in the bottom, where the furze was as high as his head, with bare places here and there, among the brakes all grown over with three-leaved grass (white clover), hurt-trees (whortleberry plants), and griglans (heath). Uncle Billy was cuttan an openan into one of these places, thinkan to touch pipe there, eat his fuggan (heavy cake), and have a smoke. As he opened the furze, to come to work his hook handy, he spied the prettiest little creature of a smale body one ever seed, sleepan away on a bank of wild thyme all in blossom. The little creature wasn't bigger than a cat, yet every inch like a man, dressed in a green coat, sky-blue breeches and stockings, with diamond-buckled shoes; his little three-cocked hat was drawn over his face to shade en from the sun while he slept. Uncle Billy stopped and looked at am more than a minute, langan to carry an home some way or other. ""Ef I could but keep am,"" thought he, ""we should soon be rich enow to ride in a coach."" Then he put down the furze-hook easy, took off the cuff from his arm, and slipped the little gentleman into the cuff, feet foremost, before he waked up. The little fellow then opened his pretty brown eyes and said, ""Mammy! where are 'e, mammy and daddy! and where am I? And who are you? You are a ?ne great bucca sure enough; what are 'e caled, an?"" says he to Uncle Billy. ""I want my mammy! Can 'e ?nd her for me?"" ""I don't know where abouts she do put up,"" says Uncle Billy. ""Come, you shall go home with me, ef you will, and live with our people till your mother do come for 'e."" ""Very well,"" says the spriggan. ""I dearly love to ride the kids over the rocks, and to have milk and blackberries for supper. Will 'e give me some?"" ""Ess, my son, and bread and honey too,"" says the old man Uncle Billy, as he took the small body up in his arms and carried him home. When the little chap was took out of the furze-cuff and placed upon the hearth-stone, he begun to play with the children as if he had lived with them all his lifetime. The old man and woman were delighted. The children crowed for joy to see the pretty little man jumpan about, and they called am Bobby Griglans. Twice a day a little chayne cup of milk, fresh from the cow, was given to Bobby. He was very nice in his diet, and didn't care for anything but a drop of milk, and a few blackberries, hurts, or hoggans (haws) for a change. In the mornings, when the work was going on, he would perch himself up on the furze and ferns in the top of the wood-corner, to be out of the smut and dirt. There he would sing and chirrup away like a robin redbreast. When the hearth was swept, the turfy ?re made up, and the old woman ?xed on the chimney stool, to knit for the afternoon, Bobby would dance for hours together on the hearth-stone, before her. The faster the knitting-needles clicked, the quicker Bobby would spin round and round. Uncle Billy and An Mary wouldn't leave Bobby go out to play, for fear he might be seen, or run away, before the next good moonlight nights, when he promised to show the old couple the exact spot, on Rosewall Hill, where there was lots of money buried, and another place on the hill where there was a good lode of tin. Three days after Bobby Griglans was catched and carried up to Trevidga, half-a-score or more of the neighbours came, with their horses and leaders, to help Uncle Billy get home his furze from the hill, in trusses, and to help him make the rick for winter, as the custom was before wheel-roads were made and wains came into use. The old man didn't like for the spriggan to be seen, so he shut him and the youngest children up in the barn and put a padlock on the door. The smale people had been getting scarcer and scarcer, as so much larning and love of unpoetical facts came into fashan, until they were nearly all frightened away. However, Uncle Billy would keep his out of sight for the time, because you see it was become such a rare thing to see a spriggan or piskey that the folks would be coming about in troops to have a look at Bobby, who didn't like to be gazed at and made to show all his parts to strangers. ""Now, stay in the barn and play like good children, but ef one of 'e cry, or try to get out, you will get your breeches warmed with a good wallopan,"" says Uncle Billy. The children were sometimes heard laughan and sometimes cryan. Bobby passed the time dancean on the barn-boards and peepan through the cracks in the door at the furze-carriers; but, as soon as ever the men went in to dinner, up jumped Bob, unbarred the winder, called to the children, ""Come along, come, quick; now for a game of mop-and-heede' (hide and seek)."" Bob and the children jumped out and away, to play among the trusses of furze dropped all round the stem of the rick. In turnan a corner they saw a little man and woman no bigger than Bob. The little man was dressed just like an, only he wore high ridan boots with little silver spurs. The little woman's green gound was spangled all over with silver stars; diamond buckles shone in her high-heeled shoes; and her little steeple-crowned blue hat, perched on a pile of golden curls, was wreathed round with griglan blossoms. The pretty little soul was wringan her hands and cryan, ""Oh! my dear and tender Skillywidden; wherever can'st a be gone to? Shall I never cast eyes on thee any more, my only joy?"" ""Now go 'e back, do,"" says Bob to the children. ""My dad and mam are come here too!"" On the same breath he called out, ""Here I am, mammy."" By the time he said ""Here I am,"" the little man and woman, with their precious Skillywidden, were no more to be seen, and they have never ben seen there since. The children got a good threshan for leavan Skillywidden get away, and serve them right, for ef they had kept an in tell night, he would have shown their daddy where plenty of crocks of gold are buried, and all of them would be gentry now.",England,"Source (books.google.com): William Bottrell, Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West Cornwall (Penzance: Printed for the author by W.

A Fairy Captured,6010,The Wonderful Plough,"On the road leading to this farmer's ground there stood a stone cross, and every morning as he went to his work he used to stop and kneel down before this cross, and pray for some minutes. On one of these occasions he noticed on the cross a pretty bright insect, of such a brilliant hue that he could not recollect having ever before seen the like with an insect. He wondered greatly at this, yet still he did not disturb it; but the insect did not remain long quiet, but ran without ceasing backwards and forwards on the cross, as if it was in pain and wanted to get away. Next morning the farmer again saw the very same insect, and again it was running to and fro, in the same state of uneasiness. The farmer began now to have some suspicions about it, and thought to himself, ""Would this now be one of the little black enchanters? For certain, all is not right with that insect; it runs about just like one that had an evil conscience, as one that would, yet cannot, go away."" And a variety of thoughts and conjectures passed through his mind; and he called to mind what he had often heard from his father, and other old people, that when the underground-people chance to touch any thing holy, they are held fast and cannot quit the spot, and are therefore extremely careful to avoid all such things. But he also thought it may as well be something else; and you would perhaps be committing a sin in disturbing and taking away the little animal; so he let it stay as it was. But when he had found it twice more in the same place, and still running about with the same marks of uneasiness, he said, ""No, it is not all right with it. So now, in the name of God!"" and he made a grasp at the insect, that resisted and clung fast to the stone; but he held it tight, and tore it away by main force, and lo! then he found he had, by the top of the head, a little ugly black chap, about six inches long, screeching and kicking at a most furious rate. The farmer was greatly astounded at this sudden transformation; still he held his prize fast and kept calling to him, while he administered to him a few smart slaps on the buttocks: ""Be quiet, be quiet, my little man! If crying was to do the business, we might look for heroes in swaddling clothes. We 'll just take you with us a bit, and see what you are good for."" The little fellow trembled and shook in every limb, and then began to whimper most piteously, and to beg hard of the farmer to let him go. But ""No, my lad,"" replied the farmer, ""I will not let you go till you tell me who you are, and how you came here, and what trade you know, that enables you to earn your bread in the world."" At this the little man grinned and shook his head, but said not a word in reply, only begged and prayed the more to get loose; and the farmer found that he must now begin to entreat him if he would coax any information out of him. But it was all to no purpose. He then adopted the contrary method, and whipped and slashed him till the blood ran down, but just to as little purpose; the little black thing remained as dumb as the grave, for this species is the most malicious and obstinate of all the underground race. The farmer now got angry, and he said, ""Do but be quiet, my child; I should be a fool to put myself into a passion with such a little brat. Never fear, I shall soon make you tame enough."" So saying, he ran home with him, and clapped him into a black, sooty, iron pot, and put the iron lid upon it, and laid on the top of the lid a great heavy stone, and set the pot in a dark cold room, and as he was going out he said to him, ""Stay there, now, and freeze till you are black! I'll engage that at last you will answer me civilly."" Twice a-week the farmer went regularly into the room and asked his little black captive if he would answer him now; but the little one still obstinately persisted in his silence. The farmer had now, without success, pursued this course for six weeks, at the end of which time his prisoner at last gave up. One day as the farmer was opening the room door, he, of his own accord, called out to him to come and take him out of his dirty stinking dungeon, promising that he would now cheerfully do all that was wanted of him. The farmer first ordered him to give him his history. The black one replied, ""My dear friend, you know it just as well as I, or else you never had had me here. You see I happened by chance to come too near the cross, a thing we little people may not do, and there I was held fast, and obliged instantly to let my body become visible; so, then, that people might not recognise me, I turned myself into an insect. But you found me out. For when we get fastened to holy or consecrated things, we never ean get away from them unless a man takes us off. That, however, does not happen without plague and annoyance to us, though, indeed, to say the truth, the staying fastened there is not over pleasant. And so I struggled against you, too, for we have a natural aversion to let ourselves be taken in a man's hand."" ""Ho, ho! is that the tune with you?"" cried the farmer. ""You have a natural aversion, have you? Believe me, my sooty friend, I have just the same for you; and so you shall be away without a moment's delay, and we will lose no time in making our bargain with each other. But you must first make me some present."" ""What you will, you have only to ask,"" said the little one. ""Silver and gold, and precious stones, and costly furniture -- all shall be thine in less than an instant."" ""Silver and gold, and precious stones, and all such glittering fine things will I none,"" said the farmer. ""They have turned the heart and broken the neck of many a one before now, and few are they whose lives they make happy. I know that you are handy smiths, and have many a strange thing with you that other smiths know nothing about. So come, now, swear to me that you will make me an iron plough, such that the smallest foal may be able to draw it without being tired, and then run off with you as fast as your legs can carry you."" So the black swore, and the farmer then cried out, ""Now, in the name of God; there, you are at liberty,"" and the little one vanished like lightning. Next morning, before the sun was up, there stood in the farmer's yard a new iron plough, and he yoked his dog Water to it, and though it was of the size of an ordinary plough, Water drew it with ease through the heaviest clay-land, and it tore up prodigious furrows. The farmer used this plough for many years, and the smallest foal or the leanest little horse could draw it through the ground, to the amazement of every one who beheld it, without turning a single hair. And this plough made a rich man of the farmer, for it cost him no horse-flesh, and he led a cheerful and contented life by means of it. Hereby we may see that moderation holds out the longest, and that it is not good to covet too much.",Germany,"Source (books.google.com): Thomas Keightley, The Fairy Mythology, vol. 1 (London: William Harrison Ainsworth, 1828), pp. 319-25.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,Church Cups,"He immediately heard the little man calling his comrades or subjects. They all suddenly appeared, pelting him with stones. Fortunately the village was not far away; otherwise he would have been lost. With his horse he jumped the gate that blocked the entrance, and was safe. The stones thrown at him now bounced off the village gate. Coming to a halt and examining his horse, he saw that all the hair had been burned off where he had spilled the drink. To give thanks for his fortunate rescue he presented the cup to the church at Viöl, where it was used for a long time. A few years ago when the parsonage was struck by lightening, it was destroyed in the ensuing fire. From Mr. Petersen, a teacher in Norstedt. One of them came out immediately and offered him a golden cup. However, the peasant did not dare to drink from it, and he poured out its entire contents behind himself. This singed off the horse's hair and skin. Then with the cup in his hand he rode off quickly toward the village. The one who had brought the cup to him shouted in the direction of the hill, ""Come quickly, Onehorn; Goldhorn is gone!"" The two of them ran after the rider, and as he rode in at the stall door, they grabbed the horse by a leg and nearly tore it off. After that the man did not dare to keep the cup at home, but instead presented it to the church. From Sundewith. After this had been the custom for many years, one day a poor man dressed in rags appeared at a wedding in Alsleben and asked for a drink from the cup, because -- as he had been told -- it could cure him of an otherwise incurable illness. The compassionate wedding couple granted his wish, but no sooner did the beggar have the cup in his hand than he disappeared with it, before the eyes of everyone present.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Altar Cup in Aagerup (Ågerup),"One Christmas Eve, a farmer's servant in the village of Aagerup went to his master and asked him if he might take a horse and ride down to look at the troll meeting. The farmer not only gave him leave but desired him to take the best horse in the stable; so he mounted and rode away down to the strand. When he was come to the place he stopped his horse, and stood for some time looking at the company who were assembled in great numbers. And while he was wondering to see how well and how gaily the little dwarfs danced, up came a troll to him, and invited him to dismount, and take a share in their dancing and merriment. Another troll came jumping up, took his horse by the bridle, and held him while the man got off, and went down and danced away merrily with them the whole night long. When it was drawing near day he returned them his very best thanks for his entertainment, and mounted his horse to return home to Aagerup. They now gave him an invitation to come again on New Year's night, as they were then to have great festivity; and a maiden who held a gold cup in her hand invited him to drink the stirrup-cup. He took the cup; but, as he had some suspicion of them, he, while he made as if he was raising the cup to his mouth, threw the drink out over his shoulder, so that it fell on the horse's back, and it immediately singed off all the hair. He then clapped spurs to his horse's sides, and rode away with the cup in his hand over a ploughed field. The trolls instantly gave chase all in a body ; but being hard set to get over the deep furrows, they shouted out, without ceasing: He, however, never minded them, but kept to the ploughed field. However, when he drew near the village he was forced to ride out on the level road, and the trolls now gained on him every minute. In his distress he prayed unto God, and he made a vow that if he should be delivered he would bestow the cup on the church. He was now riding along just by the wall of the churchyard, and he hastily flung the cup over it, that it at least might be secure. He then pushed on at full speed, and at last got into the village; and just as they were on the point of catching hold of the horse, he sprung in through the farmer's gate, and the man clapt to the wicket after him. He was now safe; but the trolls were so enraged, that, taking up a huge great stone, they flung it with such force against the gate, that it knocked four planks out of it. There are no traces now remaining of that house, but the stone is still lying in the middle of the village of Aagerup. The cup was presented to the church, and the man got in return to best farmhouse on the lands of Eriksholm.",Denmark,"Source: Thomas Keightley, The Fairy Mythology: Illustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries (London: H.

In a second footnote Keightley provides the following additional information: This is an adventure common to many countries. The church of Vigersted in Zealand has a cup obtained in the same way. The man, in this case, took refuge in the church, and was there besieged by the trolls till morning. The bridge of Hagbro in Jutland got its name from a similar event. When the man rode off with the silver jug from the beautiful maiden who presented it to him, an old crone set off in pursuit of him with such velocity, that she would surely have caught him, but that providentially he came to a running water. The pursuer, however, like Nannie with Tam o' Shanter, caught the horse's hind leg, but was only able to keep one of the cocks of his shoe: hence the bridge was called Hagbro, i. e. Cock Bridge.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Fairy Banquet,"He wondered who they could be that were breaking in that place, by their merriment, the silence of the dead night, and he wished to examine into the matter more closely. Seeing a door open in the side of the barrow, he went up to it, and looked in; and there he beheld a large and luminous house, full of people, women as well as men, who were reclining as at a solemn banquet. One of the attendants, seeing him standing at the door, offered him a cup. He took it, but would not drink; and pouring out the contents, kept the vessel. A great tumult arose at the banquet on account of his taking away the cup, and all the guests pursued him; but he escaped by the fleetness of the beast he rode, and got into the town with his booty. Finally, this vessel of unknown material, of unusual colour, and of extraordinary form, was presented to Henry the Elder, King of the English, as a valuable gift, and was then given to the queen's brother David, King of the Scots, and was kept for several years in the treasury of Scotland; and a few years ago (as I have heard from good authority), it was given by William, King of the Scots, to Henry the Second, who wished to see it.",England,"Source: Thomas Keightley, The Fairy Mythology: Illustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries (London: H.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Fairy Horn,"When alone, he was to say, as if speaking to some other person, ""I thirst,"" and immediately there would appear a cup-bearer in an elegant dress, with a cheerful countenance, bearing in his stretched-out hand a large horn, adorned with gold and gems, as was the custom among the most ancient English. In the cup nectar of an unknown but most delicious flavour was presented, and when it was drunk, all heat and weariness fled from the glowing body, so that one would be thought ready to undertake toil instead of haying toiled. Moreover, when the nectar was taken, the servant presented a towel to the drinker, to wipe his mouth with, and then having performed his office, he waited neither for a recompense for his services, nor for questions and enquiry. This frequent and daily action had for a very long period of old times taken place among the ancient people, till one day a knight of that city, when out hunting, went thither, and having called for a drink and gotten the horn, did not, as was the custom, and as in good manners he should have done, return it to the cupbearer, but kept it for his own use. But the illustrious Earl of Gloucester, when he learned the truth of the matter, condemned the robber to death, and presented the horn to the most excellent King Henry the Elder, lest he should be thought to have approved of such wickedness, if he had added the rapine of another to the store of his private property.",England,"Source: Thomas Keightley, The Fairy Mythology: Illustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries (London: H.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Öiestad (Øyestad) Horn,"The lover, however, was not disheartened, so while the father one St. John's Day was at matins in Öiestad Church, Ring came to the mansion and found his lass, although her father had taken the precaution of locking her up in one of the presses -- which, according to the custom of the time, were made at the foot of the bed -- a corner of her apron having protruded and betrayed her. They now fled, and Siur, the instant he was apprized of their elopement, mounted his horse and went in pursuit of them. On the way he was stopped by a troll, who came out of a mount, and bade him welcome, at the same time presenting to him a full drinking horn. Instead of emptying it, he cast its contents behind him, but some drops that fell on the horse's loins instantly singed the hair off. Siur, who had from the first suspected mischief, put spurs to his horse, and galloped away with the horn in his hand and the troll whining after him. He was now in a most serious dilemma, from which he was unexpectedly rescued by another troll, who was on terms of hostility with the former one, who called to him when he had just reached a large field: ""Ride through the rye and not through the wheat."" Following this counsel he got the start of his pursuer, who could not proceed so rapidly through the tall rye. The danger was not, however, completely over until he came near the mansion of Bringsvær, when the cock crew and the troll vanished. Siur now continued his pursuit without further delays, and overtook the fugitives on a hill where they had stopped to take a few moments rest. When the men got sight of each other, they immediately drew their knives, and a contest ensued, the result of which was, that Siur stabbed Ring in the belly, who instantly gave up the ghost. In expiation of this homicide, Siur was compelled to make heavy compensation. The horn, which he kept, was preserved in the family down to our times. Of the daughter's fate tradition makes no mention. The (or rather a) horn, which had long been an heirloom in Siur's family, has lately been presented by Shipmaster Berge to the public library and museum of Arendal School, where it now is. It is very handsome, and has on its three silver-gilt rings the following inscription, in monkish characters: potum servorum benedic deus alme [tuorum reliqvam unus benede le un]? caspar, melchior, baltazar. A similar occurrence to the above took place many years ago near Hahauger in Hallingdal, where one Christmas Eve a subterranean woman presented drink in a horn to a man named Gudbrand Goelberg, which he threw over his shoulder and rode off with the horn; but down to the ninth generation, his posterity, as a penalty, were afflicted with some bodily blemish or defect, as the troll had threatened. This horn, which was long preserved at Halsteensgaard in Aal, contained nearly three quarts, and was encircled by a strong gilt copper ring about three inches broad, on which, in monkish characters, stood melchior, baltazar, caspar. In the middle was a small, gilt copper plate, in which an oval crystal was set.",Norway,"Source: Benjamin Thorpe, Northern Mythology: Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands, vol. 2 (London: Edward Lumley, 1851), pp. 14-15.",NA,NA
Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Oldenburg Horn,"No sooner had the count spoken the word than the Osenberg opened, and out of the cleft there came a beautiful maiden, fairly adorned and handsomely dressed, and with her beautiful hair divided on her shoulders, and a garland on her head. And she had a rich silver vessel, that was gilded and shaped like a hunter's horn, well and ingeniously made, granulated, and fairly ornamented. It was adorned with various kinds of arms that are now but little known, and with strange unknown inscriptions and ingenious figures, and it was soldered together and adorned in the same manner as the old antiques, and it was beautifully and ingeniously wrought. This horn the maiden held in her hand, and it was full, and she gave it into the hand of the count, and prayed that the count would drink out of it to refresh himself therewith. When the count had received and taken this gilded silver horn from the maiden, and had opened it and looked into it, the drink, or whatever it was that was in it, when he shook it, did not please him, and he therefore refused to drink for the maiden. Whereupon the maiden said, ""My dear lord, drink of it upon my faith, for it will do you no harm, but will be of advantage;"" adding farther, that if the count would drink out of it, it would go well with him, count Otto, and his, and also with the whole house of Oldenburg after him, and that the whole country would improve and flourish. But if the count would place no faith in her, and would not drink of it, then for the future, in the succeeding family of Oldenburg, there would remain no unity. But when the count gave no heed to what she said, but, as was not without reason, considered with himself a long time whether he should drink or not, he held the silver gilded horn in his hand and swung it behind him, and poured it out, and some of its contents sprinkled the white horse, and where it fell and wetted him the hair all came off. When the maiden saw this, she desired to have her horn back again, but the count made speed down the hill with the horn, which he held in his hand, and when he looked round he observed that the maiden was gone into the hill again. And when terror seized on the count on account of this, he laid spurs to his horse, and at full speed hasted to join his attendants, and informed them of what had befallen him. He moreover showed them the silver gilded horn, and took it with him to Oldenburg, and the same horn, as it was obtained in so wonderful a manner, was preserved as a costly jewel by him, and by all the succeeding reigning princes of the house of Oldenburg. The Oldenburg horn, or what is called such, is now in the King of Denmark's collection.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Rillaton Gold Cup,"The story long told is that a party were hunting the wild boar in Trewartha Marsh. Whenever a hunter came near the Cheesewring a prophet -- by whom an archdruid is meant -- who lived there received him, seated in the stone chair, and offered him to drink out of his golden goblet, and if there were as many as fifty hunters approach, each drank, and the goblet was not emptied. Now on this day of the boar hunt one of those hunting vowed that he would drink the cup dry. So he rode up to the rocks, and there saw the grey druid holding out his cup. The hunter took the goblet and drank till he could drink no more, and he was so incensed at his failure that he dashed what remained of the wine in the druid's face, and spurred his horse to ride away with the cup. But the steed plunged over the rocks and fell with his rider, who broke his neck, and as he still clutched the cup, he was buried with it. Immediately outside the rampart of the stone fort above the Cheesewring is a large natural block of granite, hollowed out by the weather into a seat called the Druid's Chair.",England (Cornwall),"Source: Sabine Baring-Gould, A Book of the West: Being an Introduction to Devon and Cornwall, vol. 2 (London: Methuen and Company, 1899), p. 107.","The cup described here was discovered in 1837 in a bronze-age burial tomb near the village of Rillaton in Cornwall.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Silver Cup,"His cows were the best cows in the parish. Nowhere could you see such a fine head of cattle as he had; they were the pride of his heart, and they served him well with milk and butter. But after a time he began to think that something was amiss with the cows. He went to the cow-house the first thing every morning, and one morning he noticed the cows looking so tired they could hardly stand. When it came to milking time they found not a drop of milk. The girls, who went out to milk the cows, came back with empty cans, saying, ""The milk has gone up into the cows' horns!"" Colcheragh began to think that some one had put an evil eye on his cows, so he swept up some of the dust from the cross four-roads close by, in a shovel, and sprinkled it on their backs. But the cows got no better. Then he wondered if some one was coming at night to steal the milk. He made up his mind to sit in the cow-house all night to see if he could catch the thief. So one night after everyone had gone to bed he crept out of the house and hid himself under some straw in a corner of the cow-house. Hour after hour of the dark lonesome night crept on, and he heard nothing but the cows' breathing and their rustle in the straw. He was very cold and stiff, and he had just made up his mind to go into the house when a glimmering light showed under the door; and then he heard things laughing and talking -- queer talk. He knew that they were not right people. The cow-house door opened, and in came a whole lot of little men, dressed in green coats and leather caps. Keeking through the straw, he saw their horns hung by their sides, their whips in their hands, and scores of little dogs of every colour -- green, blue, yellow, scarlet, and every colour you can think of -- at their heels. The cows were lying down. The little fellows loosed the yokes from the cows' necks, hopped on their backs, a dozen, maybe, on each cow, and cracked their little whips. The cows jumped to their feet, and Themselves galloped off. Colcheragh ran to the stable, got on a horse, and made chase after his cows. The night was dark, but he could hear the whizz of the little whips through the air, the click of the cows' hoofs on stones, and the little dogs going, ""Yep, yep, yep."" He heard, too, the laughing of Themselves. Then one of them would be singing out to the dogs, calling them up by name, giving a call out of him, ""Ho la, ho la, la!"" Colcheragh followed these sounds, keeping close at their heels. On and on they went, helter-skelter over hedges and over ditches till they got to the Fairy Hill, and Colcheragh was still following them, though on any other night he would not have gone within a mile of the great green mound. When the little fellows came to the hill they sounded a tan-ta-ra-ra-tan on their horns. The hill opened, bright light streamed out, and sounds of music and great merriment. Themselves passed through, and Colcheragh slid off his horse and slipped unnoticed in after them. The hill closed behind them and he found himself in a fine room, lit up till it was brighter than the summer noonday. The whole place was crowded with little people, young and old, men and women, all decked out for a ball, that grand -- he had never looked on the like. Among them were some faces that he thought he had seen before, but he took no notice of them, nor they of him. In one part there was dancing to the music of Hom Mooar -- that was the name of the fiddler -- and when he played all men must follow him whether they would or no. The dancing was like the dancing of flowers in the wind, such dancing as he had never seen before. In another part his cows were being killed and roasted, and after the dance there was a great feast, with scores of tables set out with silver and gold and everything of the best to eat and drink. There was roast and boiled, and sollaghan and cowree, and puddings and pies, and jough and wine -- a feast fit for the Governor himself. When they were taking their seats one of them, whose face he thought he knew, whispered to him: ""Don't thee taste nothin' here or thou will be like me, and never go back to thy ones no more."" Colcheragh made up his mind to take this advice. When the feast was coming to an end there was a shout for the joughy-dorrys, the stirrup cup. Someone ran to fetch the cup. The one among the little people, who seemed to be their king, filled it with red wine, drank himself, and passed it on to the rest. It was going round from one to another until it came to Colcheragh, who saw, when he had it in his hands, that it was of fine carved silver, and more beautiful than anything ever seen outside that place. He said to himself, ""The little durts have stolen and killed, and eaten my cattle. This cup, if it were. mine, would pay me for all."" So standing up and grasping the silver cup tightly in his hand, he held it up and said, ""Shoh Slaynt!"" which is the Manx toast. Then he dashed the cupful of wine over Themselves and the lights. In an instant the place was in black darkness, save for, a stime of grey dawn light which came through the chink of the half-closed door. Colcheragh made for it, cup in hand, slammed the door behind him, and ran for his life. After a moment of uproar Themselves missed the cup and Colcheragh, and with yells of rage they poured out of the hill, after him, in full chase. The farmer, who had a good start, ran as he had never run before. He knew he would get small mercy at their hands if he was caught; he went splashing through the wet mire and keeping off the stepping stones; he knew they could not take him in the water. He looked over his shoulder and caught a glimpse of the whole Mob Beg behind him, close at his heels, waving their naked arms in the light of the torch each one held up. On they come, shrieking and howling in Manx: He put the cup in the church at Rushen, and they are saying it was there for, many years; then it was sent to London. It is said that after this the farmer would not go out of his house of an evening after dark.",Isle of Man,"Source: Sophia Morrison, Manx Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1911), pp. 27-33.",Link to additional tales about thieving fairies: Fairy Theft.,NA
Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Stolen Cup,"When New Year's Eve arrived he took the cup from his trunk in order to drink from it. Suddenly the cattle in the barn began to cry terribly. Everyone ran outside to see what was wrong, but they found nothing. When they came back inside they discovered that the underground people had taken back their property. From Rhode, Antiquitäten-Remarques, p. 77. ""Let's crawl inside,"" said the one. ""No,"" said the other. ""Underground people live in there for sure."" ""Then I want to go inside,"" said the first one, a daring boy. ""Dwarfs sleep at noontime."" Throwing himself to the ground, he crawled inside on all fours. There was indeed an entire little family of underground people there, sound asleep. They were lying near the walls on mats. The boy became afraid, and he was about to creep away when he saw a beautiful little cup sitting on a little round table. He picked it up and took it with him. When he arrived home his mother was very pleased with treasure that they had so easily gained. But the father scolded the boy, insisting most earnestly that he take it back to the place where he had found it. The boy set forth, but the little people, who had discovered their loss, in order to hide their dwelling had made all the surroundings look alike, so no trace could be seen of where they had been. Crying, the boy returned home with the cup. His father was an innkeeper, and a merchant had just arrived there. After examining the cup, he said, ""This is of the finest gold. You are not going to be so stupid as to return it to the rabble. Why should something like this be under the earth!"" ""Na!"" said the innkeeper. ""It will be something else if they try to get it back!"" Evening came, and a young man was returning late to the village from the field when the underground people surrounded him and told him to let it be known in the village that the following night whoever took the cup from them should place it on a certain boundary stake, where they could pick it up. If that did not happen the entire village would suffer, but if an honest person returned it, he and his property would receive special protection. When the innkeeper heard this he took his son by the hand and had him take the cup to the boundary stake. The boy never forgot this as long as he lived, and afterward he and his family always enjoyed good fortune. From O.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Story of the Fairy Horn,"One day as he was riding in the country beyond Gloucester, he came to a forest abounding in boars, stags, and every kind of wild beast. Now in a grovy lawn of this forest there was a little mount, rising in a point to the height of a man, on which knights and other hunters were used to ascend when fatigued with heat and thirst, to seek some relief. The nature of the place -- for it is a fairy place -- is, however, such that whoever ascends the mount must leave his companions, and go quite alone. As the knight rode in the wood, and came nigh this fairy-knoll, he met with a wood-cutter and questioned him about it. He must go thither alone, the wood-cutter told him, and say, as if speaking to some other person, ""I thirst!"" Immediately there would appear a cup-bearer in a rich crimson dress, with a shining face, bearing in his stretchedout hand a large horn, adorned with gold and gems, such as was the custom among the most ancient English. The cup was full of nectar, of an unknown but most delicious flavour, and when it was drunk, all heat and weariness fled from those who drank of it, so that they became ready to toil anew, instead of being tired from having toiled. Moreover, when the nectar was drunk, the cup-bearer offered a towel to the drinker, to wipe his mouth with, and then having done this courtesy, he waited neither for a silver penny for his services, nor for any question to be asked. Now the knight with the Wyvern laughed to himself when he heard this. ""Who,"" thought he, ""would be fool enough, having within his grasp such a drinking-horn, ever to let it go again from him!"" Later, that very same day, as he rode back hot and tired and thirsty from his hunting, he bethought him of the fairy-knoll and the fairy-horn. Sending away his followers, he repaired thither all alone, and did as the wood-cutter had told him. He ascended the little hill, and said in a bold voice, ""I thirst!"" Instantly there appeared, as the wood-cutter had foretold, a cup-bearer in a crimson dress, bearing in his hand a drinking-horn. The horn was richly beset with precious gems; and the knight was filled with envy at sight of it. No sooner had he seized upon it, and tasted of its delicious nectar, which glowed in his veins, than he determined when he had drained it to make off with the horn. So, having gotten the horn, and drunk of it every drop, instead of returning it to the cup-bearer, as in good manners he should have done, he stepped down from the knoll, and rudely made off with it in his hand. But, learn ye then what fate overtook this knight that bore the Wyvern on his shield, but was without true knighthood, and robbed the Fairy Horn. For the good Earl of Gloucester, who had often quenched his thirst, and restored his strength, standing on the fairy-knoll, when he heard that the wicked knight had destroyed the kind custom of the horn, attacked the robber in his stronghold, and forthright slew him, and carried off the horn. But alas! The earl did not return it to the fairy-cupbearer, but gave it to his master and lord, King Henry the Elder.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,The Trolls Celebrate Christmas,"One Christmas night in the year 1490, as Fru Cissela Ulftand was sitting in her mansion at Liungby in Scania, a great noise was heard proceeding from the trolls assembled at the Magle stone, when one of the lady's boldest servants rode out to see what was going on. He found the stone raised, and the trolls in a noisy whirl dancing under it. A beautiful female stepped forth, and presented to the guest a drinking horn and a pipe, requesting him to drink the troll-king's health and to blow in the pipe. He took the horn and pipe, but at the same instant clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped straight, over rough and smooth, to the mansion. The trolls followed him in a body with a wild cry of threats and prayers, but the man kept the start, and delivered both horn and pipe into the hands of his mistress. The trolls promised prosperity and riches to Fru Cissela's race, if she would restore their pipe and horn; but she persisted in keeping them, and they are still preserved at Liungby, as memorials of the wonderful event. The horn is said to be of an unknown mixture of metals with brass ornaments, and the pipe of a horse's leg-bone. The man who stole them from the trolls died three days after, and the horse on the second day. Liungby mansion has been twice burnt, and the Ulftand family never prospered afterwards. This tradition teaches that Christians should act justly even towards trolls. It is also related of some priests, who were riding before daybreak by a mount on a Christmas morning, while the trolls were at their sports, how a berg- or mount-woman came out and offered them drink in metal bowls; and how they cast the drink behind them, but that some drops chanced to fall on the horses' loins and burned the hair off. The bowls they carried away with them, and such are still to be found in several churches, where, it is said, they were formerly used as chalices. This drink, which the trolls were in the habit of offering so liberally, was believed to have the property of obliterating from the memory all the past, and of rendering the guest who partook of it contented with all he met with in the mount.",Sweden,"Source: Benjamin Thorpe, Northern Mythology: Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands, vol. 2 (London: Edward Lumley, 1851), pp. 89-91.",Liungby is spelled Ljungby in modern Swedish.

Fairy Cup Legends,6045,"The Trowie ""Pig""","One morning Laurence found that he was quite unable to go to the fishing with the other men. He lay in bed all that day, and his wife went about her manifold duties, and paid very little attention to him. At nightfall she titied up the house and went to visit a neighbour, and Laurence was left alone. He was lying bemoaning his unhappy lot, when he perceived a number of little folks come trooping in over the floor. One of them carried a stone pig (earthenware bottle) in his hand. The trows, for such Laurence knew them to be, seated themselves on the hearth round the blazing peat fire. After a little, one of them spoke. ""The guidman is no weel,"" said he. ""No,"" remarked another, ""but if he had somethin' oot o' wir pig, dat wid better him."" A short silence followed, and the listener waited eagerly. ""His wife is not guid til him,"" said the first speaker; ""she'll be comin' back, so we had better go."" With this they got up in a body and made for the door, but when they were opposite the bed, Laurence cried out, ""Loard surround me, an' sae da pig!"" The trows immediately vanished, but the pig was left behind. Laurence recollected what the trow had said. He took ""somethin' oot o' da pig,"" and after a few doses all his ills departed.

Fairy Gifts,0503,{footnote 1},"Well, he was a sober little fellow enough, but the best of us may be overtaken. He was coming from the fair of Enniscorthy one fine summer evening, up along the beautiful shady road of Munfin; and when he came near the stream that bounds Tombrick, he turned into the fields to make his road short. He was singing merrily enough, but by degrees he got a little stupefied; and when he was passing the dry, grassy ditch that surrounds the rath, he felt an inclination to sit and rest himself. It is hard to sit awhile, and have your eyes a little glassy, and the things seeming to turn round you, without falling off asleep; and asleep my poor little man of straw was in a few minutes. Things like droves of cattle, or soldiers marching, or big flakes of foam on a flooded river, were pushing on though his brain, and he thought the drums were playing a march, when up he woke, and there in the face of the steep bank that was overgrown with bushes and blackthorn, a passage was open between nice pillars, and inside was a great vaulted room, with arches crossing each other, a hundred lamps hanging from the vault, and thousands of nice little gentlemen and ladies, with green coats and gowns, and red sugar-loaf caps, curled at the tops like old Irish birredhs, dancing and singing, and nice little pipers and fiddlers, perched up in a little gallery by themselves, and playing music to help out the singing. He was a little cowed at first, but as he found no one taking notice of him, he stole in, and sat in a corner, and thought he'd never be tired looking at the fine little people figuring, and cutting capers, and singing. But at last he began to find the singing and music a little tedious. It was nothing but two short bars and four words, and this was the style: The longer he looked on, the bolder he grew, and at last he shouted at the end of the verse: Oh, such cries of delight as rose up among the merry little gentry! They began the improved song, and shouted it till the vault rang:",NA,NA,NA,NA
Fairy Gifts,0503,{footnote 2},"After a few minutes, they all left off the dance, and gathered round the boss maker, and thanked him for improving their tune. ""Now,"" said the chief, ""if you with for anything, only say the word, and, if it is in our power, it must be done."" ""I thank you, ladies and gentlemen,"" says he; ""and if you would only remove this hump from my back, I'd be the happiest man in the Duffrey."" ""Oh, easy done, easy done!"" said they. ""Go on again with the dance, and you come along with us."" So on they went with: One fairy taking their new friend by the heel, shot him in a curve to the very roof, and down he came the other side of the hall. Another gave him a shove, and up he flew back again. He felt as if he had wings; and one time when his back touched the roof, he found a sudden delightful change in himself; and just as he touched the ground, he lost all memory of everything around him. Next morning he was awakened by the sun shining on his face from over Slieve Buie, and he had a delightful feel down along his body instead of the disagreeable cruith he was accustomed to. He felt as if he could go from that to the other side of the stream at one step, and he burned little daylight till he reached Glanamoin. He had some trouble to persuade the neighbors of the truth of what had happened; but the wonder held only nine days; and he had like to lose his health along with his hump, for if he only made his appearance in Ballycarney, Castle-Dockrell, Ballindaggin, Kilmeashil, or Bunclody, ten people would be inviting him to a share of a tumbler of punch, or a quart of mulled beer. The news of the wonderful cure was talked of high and low, and even went as far as Ballynocrish, in Bantry, where another poor angashore of a humpback lived. But he was very unlike the Duffrey man in his disposition: he was as cross as a brier, and almost begrudged his right hand to help his left. His poor old aunt and a neighbor of hers set out one day, along with him, along the Bunclody road, passing by Killanne and the old place of the Colcloughs at Duffrey Hall, till they reached Temple-shambo. Then they kept along the hilly by-road till they reached the little man's house near the pass. So they up and told their business, and he gave them a kind welcome, and explained all the ins and outs of his adventure; and the end was, the four went together in the heel of the evening to the rath, and left the little lord in his glory in the dry, brown grass of the round dyke, where the other met his good fortune. The little ounkran never once thanked them for all the trouble they were taking for him. He only whimpered about being left in that lonesome place, and bade them to be sure to be with him at the flight of night, because he did not know what way to take from it. At last, the poor cross creature fell asleep; and after dreaming about falling down from rocks, and being held over the sea by his hump, and then that a lion had him by the same hump, and was running away with him, and then that it was put up for a target for soldiers to shoot at, the first volley they gave awoke him, and what was it but the music of the fairies in full career. The melody was the same as it was left them by the hivemaker, and the tune and dancing was twice as good as it was at first.

He could do nothing but stare at them with his poor, cross, frightened face; and they screamed and laughed till he thought it was all over with him. But it was not over with him. ""Bring down that hump,"" says the king; and before you could kiss your hand it was clapped on, as fast as the knocker of Newgate, over the other hump. The music was over now, the lights went out, and the poor creature lay till morning in a nightmare; and there the two women found him, at daybreak, more dead than alive.

Fairy Gifts,0503,A Fairy Tale in the Ancient English Style,"His Mountain Back mote well be said To measure heigth against his Head, And lift it self above: Yet spite of all that Nature did To make his uncouth Form forbid, This Creature dar'd to love. He felt the Charms of Edith's Eyes, Nor wanted Hope to gain the Prize, Cou'd Ladies took within; But one Sir Topaz dress'd with Art, And, if a Shape cou'd win a Heart, He had a Shape to win. Edwin (if right I read my Song) With slighted Passion pac'd along All in the Moony Light: 'Twas near an old enchaunted Court, Where sportive Faeries made Resort To revel out the Night. His Heart was drear, his Hope was cross'd, 'Twas late, 'twas farr, the Path was lost That reach'd the Neighbour-Town; With weary Steps he quits the Shades, Resolv'd the darkling Dome he treads, And drops his Limbs adown. But scant he lays him on the Floor, When hollow Winds remove the Door, A trembling rocks the Ground: And (well I ween to count aright) At once an hundred Tapers light On all the Walls around. Now sounding Tongues assail his Ear, Now sounding Feet approachen near, And now the Sounds encrease: And from the Corner where he lay He sees a Train profusely gay Come pranckling o'er the Place. But (trust me Gentles!) never yet Was dight a Masquing half so neat, Or half so rich before; The Country lent the sweet Perfumes, The Sea the Pearl, the Sky the Plumes, The Town its silken Store. Now whilst he gaz'd, a Gallant drest In flaunting Robes above the rest, With awfull Accent cry'd; What Mortall of a wretched Mind, Whose Sighs infect the balmy Wind, Has here presum'd to hide? At this the Swain whose vent'rous Soul No Fears of Magick Art controul, Advanc'd in open sight; ""Nor have I Cause of Dreed,"" he said, ""Who view by no Presumption led Your Revels of the Night."" ""'Twas Grief, for Scorn of faithful Love, Which made my Steps unweeting rove Amid the nightly Dew."" 'Tis well, the Gallant crys again, We Faeries never injure Men Who dare to tell us true. Exalt thy Love-dejected Heart, Be mine the Task, or e'er we part, To make thee Grief resign; Now take the Pleasure of thy Chaunce; Whilst I with Mab my part'ner daunce, Be little Mable thine. He spoke, and all a sudden there Light Musick floats in wanton Air; The Monarch leads the Queen: The rest their Faerie Partners found, And Mable trimly tript the Ground With Edwin of the Green. The Dauncing past, the Board was laid, And siker such a Feast was made As Heart and Lip desire; Withouten Hands the Dishes fly, The Glasses with a Wish come nigh, And with a Wish retire. But now to please the Faerie King, Full ev'ry deal they laugh and sing, And antick Feats devise; Some wind and tumble like an Ape, And other-some transmute their Shape In Edwin's wond'ring Eyes. 'Till one at last that Robin hight, (Renown'd for pinching Maids by Night) Has hent him up aloof; And full against the Beam he flung, Where by the Back the Youth he hung To spraul unneath the Roof. From thence, ""Reverse my Charm,"" he crys, ""And let it fairely now suffice The Gambol has been shown."" But Oberon answers with a Smile, Content thee Edwin for a while, The Vantage is thine own. Here ended all the Phantome-play; They smelt the fresh Approach of Day, And heard a Cock to crow; The whirling Wind that bore the Crowd Has clap'd the Door, and whistled loud, To warn them all to go. Then screaming all at once they fly, And all at once the Tapers dy; Poor Edwin falls to Floor; Forlorn his State, and dark the Place, Was never Wight in sike a Case Through all the Land before. But soon as Dan Apollo rose, Full Jolly Creature home he goes, He feels his Back the less; His honest Tongue and steady Mind Han rid him of the Lump behind Which made him want Success. With lusty livelyhed he talks, He seems a dauncing as he walks, His Story soon took wind; And beautious Edith sees the Youth, Endow'd with Courage, Sense and Truth, Without a Bunch behind. The Story told, Sir Topaz mov'd, (The Youth of Edith erst approv'd) To see the Revel Scene: At close of Eve he leaves his home, And wends to find the ruin'd Dome All on the gloomy Plain. As there he bides, it so befell, The Wind came rustling down a Dell, A shaking seiz'd the Wall: Up spring the Tapers as before, The Faeries bragly foot the Floor, And Musick fills the Hall. But certes sorely sunk with woe Sir Topaz sees the Elphin show, His Spirits in him dy: When Oberon crys, ""a Man is near, A mortall Passion, cleeped Fear, Hangs flagging in the Sky."" With that Sir Topaz (Hapless Youth!) In Accents fault'ring ay for Ruth Intreats them Pity graunt; For als he been a mister Wight Betray'd by wand'ring in the Night To tread the circled Haunt; ""Ah Losell Vile, at once they roar! And little skill'd of Faerie lore, Thy Cause to come we know: Now has thy Kestrell Courage fell; And Faeries, since a Ly you tell, Are free to work thee Woe."" Then Will, who bears the wispy Fire To trail the Swains among the Mire, The Caitive upward flung; There like a Tortoise in a Shop He dangled from the Chamber-top, Where whilome Edwin hung. The Revel now proceeds apace, Deffly they frisk it o'er the Place, They sit, they drink, and eat; The time with frolick Mirth beguile, And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while 'Till all the Rout retreat.

Fairy Gifts,0503,"Billy Beg, Tom Beg, and the Fairies","Tom Beg took the staff and went to the mountain, but he could not find the white sheep. At last, when he was far from home, and dusk was coming on, he began to think that he had best go back. The night was fine, and stars and a small crescent moon were in the sky. No sound was to be heard but the curlew's sharp whistle. Tom was hastening home, and had almost reached Glen Rushen, when a grey mist gathered, and he lost his way. But it was not long before the mist cleared, and Tom Beg found himself in a green glen such as he had never seen before, though he thought he knew every glen within five miles of him, for he was born and reared in the neighborhood. He was marveling and wondering where he could be, when he heard a far-away sound drawing nearer to him. ""Aw,"" said he to himself, ""there's more than myself afoot on the mountains tonight; I'll have company."" The sound grew louder. First, it was like the humming of bees, then like the rushing of Glen Meay waterfall, and last it was like the marching and the murmur of a crowd. It was the fairy host. Of a sudden the glen was full of fine horses and of little people riding on them, with the lights on their red caps shining like the stars above and making the night as bright as day. There was the blowing of horns, the waving of flags, the playing of music, and the barking of many little dogs. Tom Beg thought that he had never seen anything so splendid as all he saw there. In the midst of the drilling and dancing and singing one of them spied Tom, and then Tom saw coming towards him the grandest little man he had ever set eyes upon, dressed in gold and silver, and silk shining like a raven's wing. ""It is a bad time you have chosen to come this way,"" said the little man, who was the king. ""Yes; but it is not here that I'm wishing to be though,"" said Tom. Then said the king, ""Are you one of us tonight, Tom?"" ""I am surely,"" said Tom. ""Then,"" said the king, ""it will be your duty to take the password. You must stand at the foot of the glen, and as each regiment goes by, you must take the password: it is 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.'"" ""I'll do that with a heart and a half,"" said Tom. At daybreak the fiddlers took up their fiddles; the Fairy army set itself in order; the fiddlers played before them out of the glen; and sweet that music was. Each regiment gave the password to Tom as it went by, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday""; and last of all came the king, and he, too, gave it, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday."" Then he called in Manx to one of his men, ""Take the hump from this fellow's back,"" and before the words were out of his mouth the hump was whisked off Tom Beg's back and thrown into the hedge. How proud now was Tom, who so found himself the straightest man in the Isle of Man! He went down the mountain and came home early in the morning with light heart and eager step. Billy Beg wondered greatly when he saw Tom Beg so straight and strong, and when Tom Beg had rested and refreshed himself he told his story how he had met the Fairies who came every night to Glen Rushen to drill. The next night Billy Beg set off along the mountain road and came at last to the green glen. About midnight he heard the trampling of horses, the lashing of whips, the barking of dogs, and a great hullabaloo, and, behold, the Fairies and their king, their dogs and their horses, all at drill in the glen as Tom Beg had said. When they saw the humpback they all stopped, and one came forward and very crossly asked his business. ""I am one of Yourselves for the night, and should be glad to do you some service,"" said Billy Beg. So he was set to take the password, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday."" And at daybreak the King said, ""It's time for us to be off,"" and up came regiment after regiment giving Billy Beg the password, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday."" Last of all came the king with his men. and gave the password also, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday."" ""AND SUNDAY,"" says Billy Beg, thinking himself clever. Then there was a great outcry. ""Get the hump that was taken off that fellow's back last night and put it on this man's back,"" said the king, with flashing eyes, pointing to the hump that lay under the hedge. Before the words were well out of his mouth the hump was clapped onto Billy Beg's back. ""Now,"" said the King, ""be off, and if ever I find you here again, I will clap another hump on to your front!"" And on that they all marched away with one great shout, and left poor Billy Beg standing where they had found him, with a hump growing on each shoulder. And he came home next day dragging one foot after another, with a wizened face and as cross as two sticks, with his two humps on his back, and if they are not off they are there still.",Isle of Man,"Source: Sophia Morrison , Manx Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1911), pp. 56-61.",NA,NA
Fairy Gifts,0503,How an Old Man Lost His Wen,"One night, while the old man was returning home laden with firewood, he was overtaken by a terrible thunderstorm, and was forced to seek shelter in a hollow tree. When the storm had abated, and just as he was about to proceed on his journey, he was surprised to hear a sound of merriment close at hand. On peeping out from his place of retreat, he was amazed to see a number of demons dancing and singing and drinking. Their dancing was so strange that the old man, forgetting caution, began to laugh, and eventually left the tree in order that he might see the performance better. As he stood watching, he saw that a demon was dancing by himself, and, moreover, that the chief of the company was none too pleased with his very clumsy antics. At length the leader of the demons said: ""Enough! Is there no one who can dance better than this fellow?"" When the old man heard these words, it seemed that his youth returned to him again, and having at one time been an expert dancer, he offered to show his skill. So the old man danced before that strange gathering of demons, who congratulated him on his performance, offered him a cup of sak, and begged that he would give them the pleasure of several other dances. The old man was extremely gratified by the way he had been received, and when the chief of the demons asked him to dance before them on the following night, he readily complied. ""That is well,"" said the chief, ""but you must leave some pledge behind you. I see that you have a wen on your right cheek, and that will make an excellent pledge. Allow me to take it off for you."" Without inflicting any pain, the chief removed the wen, and having accomplished this extraordinary feat, he and his companions suddenly vanished. The old man, as he walked towards his home, kept on feeling his right cheek with his hand, and could scarcely realize that after many years of disfigurement he had at last the good fortune to lose his troublesome and unsightly wen. At length he entered his humble abode, wife was none the less pleased with what had taken place. A wicked and cantankerous old man lived next door to this good old couple. For many years he had been afflicted with a wen on his left cheek, which had failed to yield to all manner of medical treatment. When he heard of his neighbor's good fortune, he called upon him and listened to the strange adventures with the demons. The good old man told his neighbor where he might find the hollow tree, and advised him to hide in it just before sunset. The wicked old man found the hollow tree and entered it. He had not remained concealed more than a few minutes when he rejoiced to see the demons. Presently one of the company said: ""The old man is a long time coming. I made sure he would keep his promise."" At these words the old man crept out of his hiding-place, flourished his fan, and began to dance; but, unfortunately, he knew nothing about dancing, and his extraordinary antics caused the demons to express considerable dissatisfaction. ""You dance extremely ill,"" said one of the company, ""and the sooner you stop the better we shall be pleased; but before you depart we will return the pledge you left with us last night."" Having uttered these words, the demon flung the wen at the right cheek of the old man, where it remained firmly fixed, and could not be removed. So the wicked old man, who had tried to deceive the demons, went away with a wen on either side of his face.",Japan,"Source: F. Hadland Davis, Myths and Legends of Japan (London: George G.

You must make us a promise, and keep it."" So the elves, thinking to bind the man over to return, took a large wen that grew on his forehead and kept it in pawn; upon this they all left the place, and went home. The man walked off to his own house in high glee at having passed a jovial night, and got rid of his wen into the bargain. So he told the story to all his friends, who congratulated him warmly on being cured of his wen. But there was a neighbor of his who was also troubled with a wen of long standing, and, when he heard of his friend's luck, he was smitten with envy, and went off to hunt for the hollow tree, in which, when he had found it, he passed the night. Elves, mistaking him for their former boon-companion, were delighted to see him, and said, ""You're a good fellow to recollect your promise, and we'll give you back your pledge."" So one of the elves, pulling the pawned wen out of his pocket, stuck it onto the man's forehead, on the top of the other wen which he already had. So the envious neighbor went home weeping, with two wens instead of one. This is a good lesson to people who cannot see the good luck of others, without coveting it for themselves.",Japan,"Source: A.

Filled with amazement, the two wanderers stopped and watched the dance. The old man motioned to them that they too should join in, and the little people voluntarily opened their circle. The goldsmith, who had a hump on his back, and -- like all hunchbacks -- was forward enough, stepped right up. The tailor was at first a little shy and held back, but as soon as he saw what fun it was, he too took heart and joined in. They closed the circle again, and the little people sang and danced wildly forth. However, the old man took a broad knife, that had been hanging from his belt, sharpened it, and as soon as it was sufficiently sharpened, looked at the strangers. They were frightened, but they did not have to worry for long. The old man grabbed the goldsmith and with the greatest speed smoothly shaved off his beard and the hair from his head. Then the same thing happened to the tailor. Their fear disappeared when the old man patted them friendly on their shoulders as if he wanted to say that they had done well by letting it all happen without resisting. With his finger he pointed toward a pile of coal that lay nearby, and indicated to them through gestures that they should fill their pockets with it. They both obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coal would be to them. Then they went on their way to seek out a place to spend the night. They had just arrived in the valley when the bell from a neighboring monastery struck twelve. The singing ceased instantly. Everyone disappeared, and the hill lay in lonely moonlight. The two wanderers found shelter. Lying on beds of straw, they covered themselves with their jackets. They were so tired that they forgot to take the coal out of their pockets first. They were awakened earlier than normal by a heavy weight pressing down on their limbs. They reached into their pockets, and could hardly believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coal, but with pure gold. Further, their hair and their beards had also been fully restored. Now they were rich. However, the goldsmith had twice as much as the tailor, because -- true to his greedy nature -- he had filled his pockets better. However much a greedy person has, he always wants more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they stay there another day in order to be able to gain even more wealth from the old man on the mountain that evening. The tailor did not want to do this, and said: ""I have enough and am satisfied. I am going to become a master, marry my pleasant object (as he called his sweetheart), and be a happy man."" However, to please the goldsmith, he agreed to stay one more day. That evening the goldsmith hung several bags over his shoulders in order to be able to carry everything, and set off for the hill. As had happened the night before, he found the little people dancing and singing. The old man shaved him smooth once again, and indicated that he should take some coal. Without hesitating he packed away as much as his pockets and bags would hold, and then happily returned home. Covering himself with his jacket he said: ""I can bear it, if the gold presses down on me."" With the sweet premonition that he would awaken tomorrow as a very rich man, he fell asleep. When he opened his eyes, he got up quickly in order to examine his pockets and bags. How astounded he was, that he pulled out nothing but black coal, however often he reached inside. ""Anyway, I still have the gold from the night before,"" he thought, and reached for it. Horrified, he saw that it too had turned back into coal. He struck himself on the forehead with his grimy hand, and felt that his entire head was as bald and smooth as his beardless chin. Nor was that the end of his misfortune. Only now did he notice that in addition the hump on his back, a second one, of the same size, had grown onto his chest. Now he recognized the punishment for his greed and began to cry aloud. The good tailor, who had been awakened by all this, consoled the unhappy man as best he could, saying: ""You were my traveling companion, and you can stay with me now and live from my treasure."" He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith had to bear two humps and cover his bald head with a cap as long as he lived.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Die Geschenke des kleinen Volkes,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, vol. 2 (Göttingen: Verlag der Dieterichschen Buchhandlung, 1857), no. 182, pp. 384-86.","This tale was added to the Grimms' collection in the sixth edition (1850).

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Gifts of the Mountain Spirits,"The tailor thought about his dear fiancée, whom he had left at home, and sighed because he was so poor that the musicians would not be playing at their wedding dance. As they walked along the music sounded nearer and nearer, and at last on a hill they saw many small figures, little men and little women, holding hands and dancing in a circle around an old man. They were singing (that was the music), and one after the other they bowed before the old man. The old man was somewhat larger than the others, had a long ice-gray beard that hung down low over his chest, had a majestic appearance, and was magnificently dressed. The tailor and the goldsmith stood there amazed and could not see enough. Then the old man motioned to them; the dancers opened their circle; and the goldsmith, who was a small hunchbacked fellow, stepped inside. The frightened tailor stayed where he was, but when he saw how the little men and women welcomed his companion, he took heart and followed him into the circle. With the circle now closed, the little people continued to dance and to sing. The old man took a long, broad knife, whetted it until it glistened brightly, and then shaved off the hair and the beards of the tailor and the goldsmith. They shook with fear that their heads would be next, but the old man patted them friendly on their shoulders, as if to say that it was good that they had not resisted. Afterward he pointed to a pile of coal that lay nearby, indicating to them with gestures that they should fill their pockets with it. The goldsmith, who was greedy by nature, took much more than did the tailor, even though the coal had no value. Then the two of them walked down the hill to seek shelter for the night, looking back repeatedly at the tiny dancers. The music sounded more distant and more softly. The monastery bell in the valley struck twelve, and suddenly the hill was empty. Everything had disappeared. Once at the inn the two wanderers covered themselves with their jackets, and because they were very tired, they forgot to take the coal out of their pockets. They awakened earlier than usual, because their jackets were pushing down on them like lead. They reached into the pockets and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they contained pure gold instead of coal. The goldsmith estimated that his was worth thirty thousand thalers, and the tailor's fifteen thousand. Furthermore, their hair and beards had been restored as well. They praised the old man on the mountain, and the goldsmith said, ""Do you know what? Let's go back this evening and fill our pockets clear full."" But the tailor did not want to do this. ""I have enough,"" he said, ""and am satisfied. Now I can become a master tailor and marry my Margaret. We will manage beautifully."" The goldsmith did not want to journey onward, and because they had traveled together for a long time, as a favor the tailor spent the day with him at the inn. As evening approached, the goldsmith hung several bags over his shoulders and went back to the hill. He heard the music, as they had before, and saw the little dancers with the old man in the middle. And the old man again motioned to him, shaved him, indicating that he should take some coal. He gathered up as much as he could carry away, hurried back to the village inn, covered himself with his jacket, and could not fall asleep in anticipation that the pockets and bags, now filled with light coal, would be getting heavier and heavier. But on earth not everything happens the way foolish people think it will. The pockets and bags remained light. As dawn approached he went to the window and looked at each piece of coal. It was ordinary coal, and it made his fingers black. Frightened, he fetched the gold from the previous day, but it no longer glistened. Everything had turned back into coal. Then he awakened the tailor in order to share his sorrow with him. When the tailor saw him he was horrified. Only now did the goldsmith discover his entire misfortune. His hair and his beard had been shaved off completely, and they never grew back. But the worst thing was this: he had had a hump on his back, but now he had one of the same size on his chest, and would be unable to work. He recognized this as punishment for his greed, and began to cry bitterly. However, the tailor comforted him, saying, ""Since we have been good traveling companions for so long, and since we found the treasure together, from now on you can live with me and share my treasure."" The tailor soon became a master and married his Margaret. He had many pious children and always enough work; and he is still taking care of the goldsmith with the two humps and no hair.",Germany,"Source: Emil Sommer, ""Der Berggeister Geschenke,"" Sagen, Märchen und Gebräuche aus Sachsen und Thüringen (Halle: Eduard Anton, 1846), vol. 1, pp. 82-86.","The Gifts of the Little People (Germany).

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Hunchback of Willow Brake,"When he reached boyhood, he was uglier and more deformed than he had been even in his childhood. He never went out of doors but a crowd of naughty children followed, laughing at him and mocking him. Their cruel conduct made him so shy and unsociable that he avoided their company, and he passed his time day after day alone in the Willow Brake, which stood at a short distance from his mother's house. His neighbors noticed where he was accustomed to go, and nicknamed him the Hunchback of the Willow Brake. On a certain evening, after suffering much ridicule from the children of the town where he lived, he fled with a sore heart and weeping eyes to the Willow Brake for shelter. He had not gone far into the wood, when he was met by the very prettiest little babe he had ever seen. The babe was a fairy woman, but he could not afterwards give a full description of her appearance, nor had he any recollection of her attire, beyond this, that about her shoulders was a green mantle, which was bound with a golden girdle about her waist, and that on her head was a green cap, with a tuft of silver feathers waving from its crown. ""Where are you going?"" said the fairy. ""I am going to pass the evening in the Willow Brake,"" replied Hunchback. ""Have you no companion at all with whom you can play?"" said she then. ""No; none will keep company with me, since I am not like other children,"" said Hunchback. At last she asked his name, and he told her it was Hunchback. ""Hunchback!"" she exclaimed. ""It is long since we expected to meet you. I am Play of Sunbeam, and my joy is making the world merry. Come with me, my people are expecting you, and pass the night with us, and in the morning you will have neither disability nor defect."" He went cheerfully with her, until they arrived at the back of the Big Fairy Knoll. ""Shut your eyes, and give me your hand,"" said the fairy. He did as she told him, and presently they were in the very grandest mansion he had ever seen. She dragged him up through the midst of the company, singing merrily: ""What does she wish us to do for poor Hunchback?"" ""When is Play of Sunbeam otherwise?"" said the Queen, ""and according to her request let it be."" The other fairies seized him, and when he thought that they had pulled him to pieces among them they let him go, and he was as straight and active as he behoved to be. Then he heard the sweetest music he had ever listened to, and joy filled his heart, and he began to dance with the little people that were on the floor, and stopped not until he fell, unable to stand with fatigue. He had not lain but a short time on the floor, till sleep crept over him, and he felt the fairies carrying him away through the air, and the soft, sad music receding further and further from him. At length he awoke, and on looking round, he found himself lying in the Willow Brake. He rose, and returned home. He had been away a year and a day; and in that time so great a change had come over him that it was with difficulty that his own mother knew him. She rejoiced at his coming, and after that found him a great help, for now he had a hand for every trade. Among the youngsters who used to mock at him was a boy that bore the nickname of Punchy. Punchy was a little ugly creature, with hands and feet like the paws of a frog, and a big hump between his shoulders. When he saw how Hunchback had returned, as straight as a rush and as gay as a calf-herd, he made friends with him, and rested not until Hunchback had told him everything that had happened, from the evening he went to the Willow Brake, till he came back again. He laid a vow, however, on Punchy, not to tell it to a living being, because he himself was under a promise to the fairies to keep it secret. Punchy promised to do as was requested of him. On that very evening Punchy went to the Willow Brake, expecting to meet one of the fairies who would heal him as Hunchback was healed; but he saw none. Evening after evening he continued going to the same place, until at last he saw a small manikin, sitting at the root of a holly bush, and gazing with a mocking smile on his countenance. ""Are you Play of Sunbeam?"" said Punchy. ""I am not, but I am Never-Mind-Who,"" replied the manikin. ""What is your business with Play of Sunbeam?"" ""O, that she will take this hump off me, as she took the hunch off Hunchback,"" said Punchy. ""Will you take me to the place where she dwells?"" ""I will do that,"" said Never-Mind-Who, ""but you will get leave to come out of it as you like."" ""I do not care how I get out, if I get in, and if this ugly hump is taken off me."" The little manikin gave a loud laugh, and then went away with Punchy to the Big Fairy Knoll, and took him in, as Hunchback was taken. ""Who is this come to us without invitation or tryst?"" cried the Queen, looking sternly at Punchy. ""It is a toad named Punchy whom Hunchback has sent on a chance journey, in the hope that his hump will be taken off him,"" replied Never-Mind-Who. ""Did Hunchback break his vow and his promise, that never of his own accord would he tell any one how it fared with him here?"" said the Queen, turning towards Punchy with wrath in her countenance. ""No,"" replied Punchy, ""for he told me nothing until I first prayed and entreated him."" ""You impudent fellow,"" said she, ""you will get your deserts,"" and immediately she cried to the other fairies: ""Throw the hunch on the hump, and the one load will take them home."" ""The hunch on the hump, the hunch on the hump,"" screamed all the fairies; and then they laid hold of Punchy by his hands and his feet, and tossed him up and down, to this side and that, till he lost all consciousness. When he came to himself, he lay in the Willow Brake, the hump twice its former size, and his bones so tired and bruised that he could scarcely move. With a great effort he got to his feet, and then crept home; but to the day of his death he told no one except Hunchback what happened to him in the Big Fairy Knoll.",Scotland,"Source: James MacDougall, Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic and English, edited by George Calder (Edinburgh: John Grant, 1910), pp. 205-213.",The Legend of Knockgrafton (Ireland).,NA
Fairy Gifts,0503,The Legend of Knockgrafton,"The country people were rather shy of meeting him in any lonesome place, for though, poor creature, he was as harmless and as inoffensive as a new-born infant, yet his deformity was so great that he scarcely appeared to be a human creature, and some ill-minded persons had set strange stories about him afloat. He was said to have a great knowledge of herbs and charms; but certain it was that he had a mighty skillful hand in plaiting straw and rushes into hats and baskets, which was the way he made his livelihood. Lusmore, for that was the nickname put upon him by reason of his always wearing a sprig of the fairy cap, or lusmore (the foxglove), in his little straw hat, would ever get a higher penny for his plaited work than any one else, and perhaps that was the reason why some one, out of envy, had circulated the strange stories about him. Be that as it may, it happened that he was returning one evening from the pretty town of Cahir towards Cappagh, and as little Lusmore walked very slowly, on account of the great hump upon his back, it was quite dark when he came to the old moat of Knockgrafton, which stood on the right-hand side of his road. Tired and weary was he, and noways comfortable in his own mind at thinking how much farther he had to travel, and that he should be walking all the night; so he sat down under the moat to rest himself, and began looking mournfully enough upon the moon. Presently there rose a wild strain of unearthly melody upon the ear of little Lusmore; he listened, and he thought that he had never heard such ravishing music before. It was like the sound of many voices, each mingling and blending with the other so strangely that they seemed to be one, though all singing different strains, and the words of the song were these: ""Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort""; when there would be a moment's pause, and then the round of melody went on again. Lusmore listened attentively, scarcely drawing his breath lest he might lose the slightest note. He now plainly perceived that the singing was within the moat; and though at first it had charmed him so much, he began to get tired of hearing the same round sung over and over so often without any change; so availing himself of the pause when the ""Da Luan, Da Mort"" had been sung three times, he took up the tune, and raised it with the words ""augus Da Cadine,"" and then went on singing with the voices inside of the moat, ""Da Luan, Da Mort,"" finishing the melody, when the pause again came, with ""augus Da Cadine."" The fairies within Knockgrafton, for the song was a fairy melody, when they heard this addition to the tune, were so much delighted that, with instant resolve, it was determined to bring the mortal among them, whose musical skill so far exceeded theirs, and little Lusmore was conveyed into their company with the eddying speed of a whirlwind. Glorious to behold was the sight that burst upon him as he came down through the moat, twirling round and round, with the lightness of a straw, to the sweetest music that kept time to his motion. The greatest honor was then paid him, for he was put above all the musicians, and he had servants tending upon him, and everything to his heart's content, and a hearty welcome to all; and, in short, he was made as much of as if he had been the first man in the land. Presently Lusmore saw a great consultation going forward among the fairies, and, notwithstanding all their civility, he felt very much frightened, until one stepping out from the rest came up to him and said: Lusmore! Lusmore! Doubt not, nor deplore, For the hump which you bore On your back is no more; Look down on the floor, And view it, Lusmore! At last he fell into a sound sleep, and when he awoke he found that it was broad daylight, the sun shining brightly, and the birds singing sweetly; and that he was lying just at the foot of the moat of Knockgrafton, with the cows and sheep grazing peacefully round about him. The first thing Lusmore did, after saying his prayers, was to put his hand behind to feel for his hump, but no sign of one was there on his back, and he looked at himself with great pride, for he had now become a well-shaped dapper little fellow, and more than that, found himself in a full suit of new clothes, which he concluded the fairies had made for him. Towards Cappagh he went, stepping out as lightly, and springing up at every step as if he had been all his life a dancing-master. Not a creature who met Lusmore knew him without his hump, and he had a great work to persuade every one that he was the same man -- in truth he was not, so far as outward appearance went. Of course it was not long before the story of Lusmore's hump got about, and a great wonder was made of it. Through the country, for miles round, it was the talk of every one, high and low. One morning, as Lusmore was sitting contented enough, at his cabin door, up came an old woman to him, and asked him if he could direct her to Cappagh. ""I need give you no directions, my good woman,"" said Lusmore, ""for this is Cappagh; and whom may you want here?"" ""I have come,"" said the woman,"" out of Decie's country, in the county of Waterford looking after one Lusmore, who, I have heard tell, had his hump taken off by the fairies; for there is a son of a gossip of mine who has got a hump on him that will be his death; and maybe if he could use the same charm as Lusmore, the hump may be taken off him. And now I have told you the reason of my coming so far: 'tis to find out about this charm, if I can."" Lusmore, who was ever a good-natured little fellow, told the woman all the particulars, how he had raised the tune for the fairies at Knockgrafton, how his hump had been removed from his shoulders, and how he had got a new suit of clothes into the bargain. The woman thanked him very much, and then went away quite happy and easy in her own mind. When she came back to her gossip's house, in the county of Waterford, she told her everything that Lusmore had said, and they put the little hump-backed man, who was a peevish and cunning creature from his birth, upon a car, and took him all the way across the country. It was a long journey, but they did not care for that, so the hump was taken from off him; and they brought him, just at nightfall, and left him under the old moat of Knockgrafton. Jack Madden, for that was the humpy man's name, had not been sitting there long when he heard the tune going on within the moat much sweeter than before; for the fairies were singing it the way Lusmore had settled their music for them, and the song was going on; ""Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, augus Da Cadine,"" without ever stopping. Jack Madden, who was in a great hurry to get quit of his hump, never thought of waiting until the fairies had done, or watching for a fit opportunity to raise the tune higher again than Lusmore had; so having heard them sing it over seven times without stopping, out he bawls, never minding the time or the humor of the tune, or how he could bring his words in properly, augus Da Cadine, augus Da Hena, thinking that if one day was good, two were better; and that if Lusmore had one new suit of clothes given him, he should have two. No sooner had the words passed his lips than he was taken up and whisked into the moat with prodigious force; and the fairies came crowding round about him with great anger, screeching, and screaming, and roaring out, ""Who spoiled our tune? who spoiled our tune?"" and one stepped up to him, above all the rest and said:",Ireland,NA,"The Palace in the Rath (Ireland).

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Old Man with the Wen,"He had tried all sorts of remedies and cures, but the wen only grew bigger and bigger. One day the old man was out on the mountain side gathering sticks and pieces of wood when a. heavy storm came on. The sky became dark and gloomy-looking, the lightning ?ashed, the thunder roared, and the raindrops came pattering down one after another. The old man looked about for some means of shelter, and after a little while found a large hollow in the trunk of a very big tree. He was so glad at having found it; so, putting his bundle of sticks under another tree near by, he crept into the hollow. The rain came down in torrents and the peals of thunder were deafening, whilst the vivid ?ashes of lightning were most terrifying. The poor old man was ?lled with fear, and prayed that the storm would soon cease. It was late in the afternooon, however, when the storm went over, and very soon the sky was again blue, and the rays of the setting sun were seen spreading out far and wide in the west. The old man thought he had better return home as quickly as possible, as his good wife would be wondering how he had fared in the storm; so he was just about to creep out of the hollow when he heard the tramp, tramp, tramp of many feet. The sound came nearer and nearer, and the old man, wondering whatever it could be, thrust his head out of the hollow tree. Oh! what a scare he got! Marching towards him in a long line came a great number of dreadful-looking goblins, headed by a small man with a heavy spiked club in his hand. The old man crouched back in the hollow, hardly daring to breathe. Nearer and nearer they came until, having arrived at the hollow tree, they stopped in front of it, and began to make merry. Soon the younger goblins began to dance and sing, while all the older goblins sat laughing and clapping their hands. So far, they had not seen the old man, who lay curled up in the darkest corner of the tree. After a time the old man became a little braver, and said to himself, ""I'll just peep out, and see what they are doing. I suppose it's some kind of a goblins' concert they are having, for it sounds so very, very funny."" Saying this, the old man seemed to entirely forget his fear, and ventured out farther and farther. Presently he saw one of the oldest and ugliest-looking goblins get up and say, ""Listen to me, brother goblins! You have danced very cleverly, and sang very sweetly, but for all that your dances and songs are very, very old. Do any of you know a new dance? If so, let him come forward and perform it."" The old man, on hearing these words, determined to join the company, so, with a loud yell, he jumped out from the hollow tree, and began dancing and clapping his hands. The goblins were much startled at this sudden and unexpected appearance of the old man, and they almost fell over each other in alarm. Still the old man kept on dancing, for he knew that his whole life depended on that single dance. The goblins sat dumbfounded, watching every movement of the old man. ""Excellent!"" said one goblin; ""Simply marvellous!"" said many others; and one and all of the goblins praised the old man's dancing very highly. At last the old man stopped and apologised for his gross rudeness in interrupting their honourable feast. ""Oh! my dearest man,"" replied the leader of the goblins, ""we all feel indeed grateful to you for your very worthy performance -- it was simply wonderful for so old a man. You have indeed honoured us very much by your presence. Please do us the favour of coming again and dancing for us."" The aged dancer was very delighted on hearing these words, and promised to come again. ""When will you come again?"" asked one of the goblins. ""Tomorrow?"" ""Yes -- very well, I shall come again tomorrow and dance many times for you,"" replied the old man. ""But you must give us some pledge that you will indeed come tomorrow,"" said the leader of the goblins. ""Look here! give us that wen of yours, for I believe a wen on the side of the face is a sign of good luck, and if we take that you will be certain to come again in order to get it back."" ""Yes! yes!"" cried all the goblins, ""let us take his wen!"" Now this was just what the old man had long wished for, that some goblin or fairy would take from him that troublesome lump, as it had always been a great nuisance to him, and had also caused him much pain. So, without waiting for the old man to make any reply, they seized the wen from the cheek of the delighted old man, and disappeared from sight. Oh! how glad he now felt, for that horrid lump had been taken from him, so with a light heart he began to set out for home. How glad his poor aged wife was to see him, but how much gladder she was to hear the strange story of how her husband had lost his wen. ""It is quite a blessing,"" she said joyfully. ""You have indeed been favoured by the gods, and so we ought to be very thankful."" Now it happened that in the very next house lived another man who also had a wen on his right cheek, so when he heard the old man's story he felt very envious, and longed to get rid of his troublesome wen also. So he asked his kind old neighbour where he could ?nd the goblins, as he intended to set out the very next day. The kind old man told his neighbour the very place and time in which he could ?nd the goblins; so thanking the kind old man, the neighbour set out. On and on he went until he came to the hollow tree in which his neighbour, the kind old man, had taken refuge from the storm the day before. Towards evening the goblins came, and there they found whom they supposed to be the old man already waiting for them. The neighbour had taken care to conceal his wen behind a fan which he carried in his hand until he began to dance. ""Oh, how glad we are to see you!"" cried all the goblins. ""Do make haste and begin to dance for us again."" So the neighbour, who was also an old man, began to dance, holding the fan and singing as loudly as he could. Now this old man could not dance half so well as the other old man, and he began to hop and jump all over the place. ""Here, stop that foolish dancing,"" cried the goblins; ""dance as you did yesterday! You are dancing very badly today. Do something better or else stop."" But the old man kept on with his clumsy style of dancing, until the goblins got quite angry, and, taking the wen which they took from the other old man the day before, one of the goblins threw it at the old man's left check, where it stuck and began growing at once. Oh! how sorry was this old man then, for, instead of losing the wen on his right cheek, he had gained one on his left. The goblins then quickly disappeared into the woods of the mountain; and the old man was left alone -- a pitiful sight -- with a big wen on each side of his face.",Japan,"Source (books.google.com): Alan Leslie Whitehorn, Wonder Tales of Old Japan (New York: Frederick A.

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Story of Hok Lee and the Dwarfs,"""What an excellent industrious man is this Hok Lee!"" said his neighbors; ""how hard he works: he never leaves his house to amuse himself or to take a holiday as others do!"" But Hok Lee was by no means the virtuous person his neighbors thought him. True, he worked hard enough by day, but at night, when all respectable folk were fast asleep, he used to steal out and join a dangerous band of robbers, who broke into rich people's houses and carried off all they could lay hands on. This state of things went on for some time, and, though a thief was caught now and then and punished, no suspicion ever fell on Hok Lee, he was such a very respectable, hardworking man. Hok Lee had already amassed a good store of money as his share of the proceeds of these robberies when it happened one morning on going to market that a neighbor said to him: ""Why, Hok Lee, what is the matter with your face? One side of it is all swelled up."" True enough, Hok Lee's right cheek was twice the size of his left, and it soon began to feel very uncomfortable. ""I will bind up my face,"" said Hok Lee; ""doubtless the warmth will cure the swelling."" But no such thing. Next day it was worse, and day by day it grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as large as his head and became very painful. Hok Lee was at his wits' ends what to do. Not only was his cheek unsightly and painful, but his neighbors began to jeer and make fun of him, which hurt his feelings very much indeed. One day, as luck would have it, a traveling doctor came to the town. He sold not only all kinds of medicine, but also dealt in many strange charms against witches and evil spirits. Hok Lee determined to consult him, and asked him into his house. After the doctor had examined him carefully, he spoke thus: ""This, O Hok Lee, is no ordinary swelled face. I strongly suspect you have been doing some wrong deed which has called down the anger of the spirits on you. None of my drugs will avail to cure you, but, if you are willing to pay me handsomely, I can tell you how you may be cured."" Then Hok Lee and the doctor began to bargain together, and it was a long time before they could come to terms. However, the doctor got the better of it in the end, for he was determined not to part with his secret under a certain price, and Hok Lee had no mind to carry his huge cheek about with him to the end of his days. So he was obliged to part with the greater portion of his ill-gotten gains. When the Doctor had pocketed the money, he told Hok Lee to go on the first night of the full moon to a certain wood and there to watch by a particular tree. After a time he would see the dwarfs and little sprites who live underground come out to dance. When they saw him they would be sure to make him dance too. ""And mind you dance your very best,"" added the doctor. ""If you dance well and please them they will grant you a petition and you can then beg to be cured; but if you dance badly they will most likely do you some mischief out of spite."" With that he took leave and departed. Happily the first night of the full moon was near, and at the proper time Hok Lee set out for the wood. With a little trouble he found the tree the doctor had described, and, feeling nervous, he climbed up into it. He had hardly settled himself on a branch when he saw the little dwarfs assembling in the moonlight. They came from all sides, till at length there appeared to be hundreds of them. They seemed in high glee, and danced and skipped and capered about, whilst Hok Lee grew so eager watching them that he crept further and further along his branch till at length it gave a loud crack. All the dwarfs stood still, and Hok Lee felt as if his heart stood still also. Then one of the dwarfs called out, ""Someone is up in that tree. Come down at once, whoever you are, or we must come and fetch you."" In great terror, Hok Lee proceeded to come down; but he was so nervous that he tripped near the ground and came rolling down in the most absurd manner. When he had picked himself up, he came forward with a low bow, and the dwarf who had first spoken and who appeared to be the leader, said, ""Now, then, who art thou, and what brings thee here?"" So Hok Lee told him the sad story of his swelled cheek, and how he had been advised to come to the forest and beg the dwarfs to cure him. ""It is well,"" replied the dwarf. ""We will see about that. First, however, thou must dance before us. Should thy dancing please us, perhaps we may be able to do something; but shouldst thou dance badly, we shall assuredly punish thee, so now take warning and dance away."" With that, he and all the other dwarfs sat down in a large ring, leaving Hok Lee to dance alone in the middle. He felt half frightened to death, and besides was a good deal shaken by his fall from the tree and did not feel at all inclined to dance. But the dwarfs were not to be trifled with. ""Begin!"" cried their leader, and ""Begin!"" shouted the rest in chorus. So in despair Hok Lee began. First he hopped on one foot and then on the other, but he was so stiff and so nervous that he made but a poor attempt, and after a time sank down on the ground and vowed he could dance no more. The dwarfs were very angry. They crowded round Hok Lee and abused him. ""Thou to come here to be cured, indeed!"" they cried, ""thou hast brought one big cheek with thee, but thou shalt take away two."" And with that they ran off and disappeared, leaving Hok Lee to find his way home as best he might. He hobbled away, weary and depressed, and not a little anxious on account of the dwarfs' threat. Nor were his fears unfounded, for when he rose next morning his left cheek was swelled up as big as his right, and he could hardly see out of his eyes. Hok Lee felt in despair, and his neighbors jeered at him more than ever. The doctor, too, had disappeared, so there was nothing for it but to try the dwarfs once more. He waited a month till the first night of the full moon came round again, and then he trudged back to the forest, and sat down under the tree from which he had fallen. He had not long to wait. Ere long the dwarfs came trooping out till all were assembled. ""I don't feel quite easy,"" said one; ""I feel as if some horrid human being were near us."" When Hok Lee heard this he came forward and bent down to the ground before the dwarfs, who came crowding round, and laughed heartily at his comical appearance with his two big cheeks. ""What dost thou want?"" they asked; and Hok Lee proceeded to tell them of his fresh misfortunes, and begged so hard to be allowed one more trial at dancing that the dwarfs consented, for there is nothing they love so much as being amused. Now, Hok Lee knew how much depended on his dancing well, so he plucked up a good spirit and began, first quite slowly, and faster by degrees, and he danced so well and gracefully, and made such new and wonderful steps, that the dwarfs were quite delighted with him. They clapped their tiny hands, and shouted, ""Well done, Hok Lee, well done, go on, dance more, for we are pleased."" And Hok Lee danced on and on, till he really could dance no more, and was obliged to stop. Then the leader of the dwarfs said, ""We are well pleased, Hok Lee, and as a recompense for thy dancing thy face shall be cured. Farewell."" With these words he and the other dwarfs vanished, and Hok Lee, putting his hands to his face, found to his great joy that his cheeks were reduced to their natural size. The way home seemed short and easy to him, and he went to bed happy, and resolved never to go out robbing again. Next day the whole town was full of the news of Hok's sudden cure. His neighbors questioned him, but could get nothing from him, except the fact that he had discovered a wonderful cure for all kinds of diseases. After a time a rich neighbor, who had been ill for some years, came, and offered to give Hok Lee a large sum of money if he would tell him how he might get cured. Hok Lee consented on condition that he swore to keep the secret. He did so, and Hok Lee told him of the dwarfs and their dances. The neighbor went off, carefully obeyed Hok Lee's directions, and was duly cured by the dwarfs. Then another and another came to Hok Lee to beg his secret, and from each he extracted a vow of secrecy and a large sum of money. This went on for some years, so that at length Hok Lee became a very wealthy man, and ended his days in peace and prosperity.",China,NA,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Green Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1892), pp. 229-33.

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Tailor on the Brocken,"One of the witches noticed him and shouted to another one, ""See what a large burl that willow branch has. I'm going to drive my ax into it, so I can find it again next year."" And she drove her ax into his back. He only felt a single stab, but from that moment onward his back was very heavy, and when the sun came up he saw with terror from his shadow that he was now a hunchback. Nevertheless, the following year when the first of May was approaching he could not restrain his desire to return to Glocker Mountain, because the dances had pleased him so much. Seated once again in the willow tree, the witch saw him, as before, and said, ""I want to pull my ax out of the willow burl, so I won't lose it."" She reached for his back, and he felt a light stab.

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Two Humpbacks,"""Go,"" said the other. ""If you make your fortune, return, and I will go and see if I can make mine."" So the humpback set off on his journey. Now these two humpbacks were from Parma. When the humpback had gone a long way, he came to a square where there was a fair, at which everything was sold. There was a person selling cheese, who cried out: ""Eat the little Parmesan!"" The poor humpback thought he meant him, so he ran away and hid himself in a courtyard. When it was one o'clock, he heard a clanking of chains and the words ""Saturday and Sunday"" repeated several times. Then he answered: ""And Monday."" ""Oh, heavens!"" said they who were singing. ""Who is this who has harmonized with our choir?"" They searched and found the poor humpback hidden. ""O gentlemen!"" he said, ""I have not come here to do any harm, you know!"" ""Well! we have come to reward you; you have harmonized our choir; come with us!"" They put him on a table and removed his hump, healed him, and gave him two bags of money. ""Now,"" they said, ""you can go."" He thanked them and went away without his hump. He liked it better, you can believe! He returned to his place at Parma, and when the other humpback saw him he exclaimed: ""Does not that look just like my friend? But he had a hump! It is not he! Listen! You are not my friend so and so, are you?"" ""Yes, I am,"" he replied. ""Listen! Were you not a humpback?"" ""Yes. They have removed my hump and given me two bags of money. I will tell you why. I reached,"" he continued, ""such and such a place, and I heard them beginning to say, 'Eat the little Parmesan! Eat the little Parmesan!' I was so frightened that I hid myself."" (He mentioned the place -- in a courtyard.) ""At a certain hour, I heard a noise of chains and a chorus singing: 'Saturday and Sunday.' After two or three times, I said: 'And Monday.' They came and found me, saying that I had harmonized their chorus, and they wanted to reward me. They took me, removed my hump, and gave me two bags of money."" ""Oh, heavens!"" said the other humpback. ""I want to go there, too!"" ""Go, poor fellow, go! Farewell!"" The humpback reached the place, and hid himself precisely where his companion had. After a while he heard a noise of chains, and the chorus: ""Saturday and Sunday!"" Then another chorus: ""And Monday!"" After the humpback had heard them repeat: ""Saturday and Sunday, and Monday!"" several times, he added: ""And Tuesday!"" ""Where,"" they exclaimed, ""is he who has spoiled our chorus? If we find him, we will tear him in pieces."" Just think! they struck and beat this poor humpback until they were tired; then they put him on the same table on which they had placed his companion, and said: ""Take that hump and put it on him in front."" So they took the other's hump and fastened it to his breast, and then drove him away with blows. He went home and found his friend, who cried: ""Mercy! Is not that my friend? But it cannot be, for this one is humpbacked in front. Listen,"" he said, ""are you not my friend?"" ""The same,"" he answered, weeping. ""I did not want to bear my own hump, and now I have to carry mine and yours! and so beaten and reduced, you see!"" ""Come,"" said his friend, ""come home with me, and we will eat a mouthful together; and don't be disheartened."" And so, every day, he dined with his friend, and afterward they died, I imagine.",Italy,NA,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (London: Macmillan and Company, 1885), no. 27, pp. 103-104.

Fairy Gifts,0503,The Two Hunchbacked Brothers,"After treating him ill for a long time, she at last sent him away from the house altogether. The poor little hunchback wandered away without knowing where to go. On, on, on he went, till at last he came to a lonely hut on a wide moor. At his approach a whole host of little hunchbacks came out and danced round him, chanting plaintively: ""Good people,"" said our hunchback -- now hunchbacked no more -- ''I thank you much for ridding me of my hump and making me a well-grown lad. Give me now some work to do among you, and let me live with you."" But the chief of the strange people answered him and said: ""This favour we owe to you, not you to us; for it was your chiming in with the right word on the right note which destroyed the spell that held us all. And in testimony of our gratitude we give you further this little wand, and you will not need to work with us. Go back and live at home, and if ever anyone beats you as heretofore, you have only to say to it, 'At 'em, good stick!' and you will see what it will do for you."" Then all disappeared, and the boy went home. ""So you've come back, have you?"" said the stepmother. ""What, and without your hump, too! Where have you left that?"" Then the good boy told her all that had happened, without hiding anything. ""Do you hear that?"" said the stepmother to her own son. ""Now go you and get rid of your hump in the same way."" So the second hunchback went forth, and journeyed on till he came to the lonely hut on the moor. A tribe of hunchbacks came out and danced round him, and sung"" Thus they sent him home to his mother. When his mother saw him come home in this plight, she turned upon the stepson and abused him for having misled her son to injure him; and both mother and son set upon him and belaboured him after their wont. But he had only told the truth, without intention to deceive; and the stepmother's son had incurred the anger of the dwarfs by his discordant addition to their chant. So the first hero took out his wand and said, ""At' em, good stick!"" and the wand flew out of his hand and administered on mother and son a sounder drubbing than that they had themselves been administering.

The Faithful Wife,0888,A Story Told by a Hindu,"Then the younger brother sent drummers through the city to proclaim that the whole kingdom was his. The shame of this was more than the elder prince could bear, so he resolved to quit the country, and he told his wife of his intention and bade her stay behind. But his faithful wife refused to be parted from him. She vowed that he had married her not for one day nor for two, but for good and all, and that where he went, there she would go, and whatever troubles he met, she would share. So he allowed her to come with him, and the two set off to foreign parts. After some time their path led them through an extensive jungle, and after traveling through it for two days they at last lost their way completely. Their food gave out; they were faint with starvation and torn with briars. The prince urged his wife to return, but she would not hear of it, so they pushed on, supporting life on jungle fruits. Sometimes the prince would go far ahead, for his faithful wife could only travel slowly, and then he would return and wait for her. At last he got tired of leading her on and made up his mind to abandon her. At night they lay down at the foot of a tree, and the prince thought, ""If wild animals would come and eat us, it would be the best that could happen. I cannot bear to see my wife suffer any more. Although her flesh is torn with thorns, she will not leave me. I will leave her here; may wild beasts kill both her and me, but I cannot see her die before my eyes."" So thinking he got up quietly and went off as quickly as he could. When the princess woke and found that she had been abandoned, she began to weep, and wept from dawn to noon without ceasing. At noon a being in the guise of an old woman appeared and asked her why she wept, and comforted her and promised to lead her out of the wood and told her that Chando [a sun god] had had compassion on her and would allow her to find her husband again if they both lived. So saying, the old woman led the princess from the forest and showed her the way to a great city where a Raja lived. The princess went begging her way through the city to the Raja's palace, and there they engaged her as a servant. Now her husband had also escaped from the jungle and sought employment as a laborer, but no one would give him work for more than a day or two, and at last his search for work brought him to the city in which the princess was; and there he was engaged as a groom in the palace stables. The prince had changed his name, and he had no chance of knowing that his wife was in the palace, because she was confined to the women's apartments. So some years passed without their having news of each other. At last one day the princess happened to go onto the roof and looking down at the stables saw and thought she recognized her husband. Then she leaned over and listened till she heard his voice, and at that she was sure that it was he, so she hastened to the Raja and begged to be allowed to meet her husband, and the Raja sent to call the syce [a servant who attends to horses] with the name which the princess had given, but no one came, for the prince would not reveal himself. Then the princess told their story, and how her husband had gambled away his half of the kingdom. The Raja ordered anyone with such a history to come forward, as his wife was in the palace; but the prince did not reveal himself. Then the princess said, ""Let all the syces cook rice and bring me a bit of each man's cooking to taste."" They did so, and when she tasted the rice cooked by her husband, she at once said that it was his. Her husband was unable to deny it and admitted everything. Then they took him away from his work in the stables and let him live with his wife. After a time the Raja wrote to the younger brother asking whether he would restore the half of the kingdom which he had won; and the younger brother answered that he would gladly do so, if his brother would sign an agreement never to gamble anymore. It was with this object in view and to teach him the folly of his ways that he had dispossessed him. The elder brother gladly gave the required promise and returned to his kingdom with his faithful wife, and lived happily ever afterwards.",India,"Source (Internet Archive): Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 42, pp. 144-47.",NA,NA
The Faithful Wife,0888,Conrad von Tannenberg,"Ages ago there lived in Tannenberg Castle on the mountain road a knight whose name was Conrad. He had a wife named Ann-Els who was as beautiful as she was pious. One time she became seriously ill, and he vowed that if she should recover he would make a pilgrimage to the Holy Grave and there battle against the infidels. And lo, Ann-Els recovered soon thereafter, and when her health had fully returned, the knight made himself ready to depart on a pilgrimage. With many tears he took leave of his wife and journeyed to the sea, where together with companions he had met underway he boarded a ship. At sea the ship was attacked by pirates. He and his companions were taken prisoner and sold as slaves to an eminent Turk. Year upon year passed, and his wife received no news from him. Because she was wealthy, she received many marriage proposals from neighboring knights, but she was interested in none of them and rejected them all, which caused a great deal of hate and animosity toward her. Then one day she heard from another pilgrim who was returning home from the promised land that her husband was languishing as a prisoner among the Turks, and she resolved to rescue him, cost it what it may. Dressing herself in men's clothes, she took her harp, which she could play very well, and journeyed across the sea to Turkey. Arriving there safely, she sought and inquired after her husband until finally she discovered where he was. Then one day she approached the Turk who was his master and played such beautiful melodies on her harp, and sang with such charm, that the Turk said she should name her own reward, that he would give her anything she requested. Then she said, ""I ask only for a slave to serve me,"" and from among the slaves she selected one -- her dear husband. However, she did not identify herself to him, but kept him away from her. After the sea voyage was successfully completed and they found themselves again on Christian soil, she left a sum of money for him, then secretly slipped away and hurried home as fast as possible. Not long afterward Conrad too arrived at Tannenberg Castle and was joyfully and festively received by his wife. All the knights from the surrounding area came to the castle to wish him well. While they were eating Knight Conrad told them of his adventures, how he had been captured, mistreated, and so miraculously rescued. Then several of the knights whose marriage proposals Ann-Els had rejected whispered into his ear that in the meantime his wife had been traveling about the land dressed in men's clothes and leading an indecent life. Upon hearing this Conrad jumped up angrily, drew his sword, and attempted to kill Ann-Els, but she fled into her room and barred the door so that he could not harm her. Not long afterward she returned to the hall carrying her harp and wearing the clothes in which she had freed Conrad, and she played a melody. Then Knight Conrad jumped up and fell into the singer's arms. She threw off the clothes and stood there as the faithful Ann-Els. It is not necessary to say how happy Conrad was, nor that the gossipers disappeared as soon as they possibly could, not letting themselves be seen again, and that the festival ended even more joyfully than it had begun.",Germany,"Source (books.google.com): J.

The Faithful Wife,0888,Of Chastity,"Calling him, therefore, he said, ""My good friend, ask of me what you will; so that it be possible, I will do it, provided you marry my daughter."" The other assented, and the nuptial rites were celebrated accordingly. Then the mother of the lady said to the carpenter, ""My son, since you have become one of our family, I will bestow upon you a curious shirt. It possesses this singular property, that as long as you and your wife are faithful to each other, it will neither be rent, nor worn, nor stained. But if -- which Heaven forbid! -- either of you prove unfaithful, instantly it will lose its virtue."" The carpenter, very happy in what he heard, took the shirt, and returned great thanks for the gift. A short while afterward, the carpenter being sent for to superintend the building of the emperor's palace, took with him the valuable present which he had received. He continued, absent until the structure was complete; and numbers, observing how much he labored, admired the freshness and spotless purity of his shirt. Even the emperor condescended to notice it, and said to him, ""My master, how is it that in despite of your laborious occupation, and the constant use of your shirt, it still preserves its color and beauty?"" ""You must know, my Lord,"" said he, ""that as long as my wife and I continue faithful to each other, my shirt retains its original whiteness and beauty; but if either of us forget our matrimonial vows, it will sully like any other cloth."" A soldier, overhearing this, thought within himself, ""If I can I will make you wash your shirt."" Wherefore, without giving any cause of suspicion to the carpenter, he secretly hastened to his house, and solicited his wife to dishonor. She received him with an appearance of pleasure, and seemed to be entirely influenced by the same feelings. ""But,"" added she, ""in this place we are exposed to observation; come with me, and I will conduct you into a private chamber."" He followed her, and closing the door, she said, ""Wait here awhile; I will return presently."" Thus she did every day, all the time supplying him only with bread and water. Without regard to his urgency, she compelled him to endure this humiliating treatment; and before long, two other soldiers came to her from the emperor's court, with the same evil views. In like manner, she decoyed them into the chamber, and fed them with bread and water. The sudden disappearance, however, of the three soldiers gave rise to much inquiry; and the carpenter, on the completion of his labors, received the stipulated sum, and returned to his own home. His virtuous wife met him with joy, and looking upon the spotless shirt, exclaimed, ""Blessed be God! Our truth is made apparent -- there is not a single stain upon the shirt."" To which he replied, ""My beloved, during the progress of the building, three soldiers, one after another, came to ask questions about the shirt. I related the fact, and since that time nothing has been heard of them."" The lady smiled, and said, ""The soldiers respecting whom you feel anxious thought me a fit subject for their improper solicitation, and came hither with the vilest intent. I decoyed them into a remote chamber, and have fed them with bread and water."" The carpenter, delighted with this proof of his wife's fidelity, spared their lives, and liberated them; and he and his wife lived happily for the rest of their lives.",Gesta Romanorum Application,"Source (books.google.com): Gesta Romanorum, translated from the Latin by Charles Swan; revised and corrected by Wynnard Hooper (London: George Bell and Sons, 1905), no. 69, pp. 122-24.

The Faithful Wife,0888,The Lute Player,"Once upon a time there was a king and queen who lived happily and comfortably together. They were very fond of each other and had nothing to worry them, but at last the king grew restless. He longed to go out into the world, to try his strength in battle against some enemy and to win all kinds of honor and glory. So he called his army together and gave orders to start for a distant country where a heathen king ruled who ill treated or tormented everyone he could lay his hands on. The king then gave his parting orders and wise advice to his ministers, took a tender leave of his wife, and set off with his army across the seas. I cannot say whether the voyage was short or long; but at last he reached the country of the heathen king and marched on, defeating all who came in his way. But this did not last long, for in time he came to a mountain pass, where a large army was waiting for him, who put his soldiers to flight, and took the king himself prisoner. He was carried off to the prison where the heathen king kept his captives, and now our poor friend had a very bad time indeed. All night long the prisoners were chained up, and in the morning they were yoked together like oxen and had to plow the land till it grew dark. This state of things went on for three years before the king found any means of sending news of himself to his dear queen, but at last he contrived to send this letter: ""Sell all our castles and palaces, and put all our treasures in pawn and come and deliver me out of this horrible prison."" The queen received the letter, read it, and wept bitterly as she said to herself, ""How can I deliver my dearest husband? If I go myself and the heathen king sees me he will just take me to be one of his wives. If I were to send one of the ministers! -- but I hardly know if I can depend on them."" She thought, and thought, and at last an idea came into her head. She cut off all her beautiful long brown hair and dressed herself in boy's clothes. Then she took her lute and, without saying anything to anyone, she went forth into the wide world. She traveled through many lands and saw many cities, and went through many hardships before she got to the town where the heathen king lived. When she got there she walked all round the palace and at the back she saw the prison. Then she went into the great court in front of the palace, and taking her lute in her hand, she began to play so beautifully that one felt as though one could never hear enough. After she had played for some time she began to sing, and her voice was sweeter than the lark's: I come from my own country far Into this foreign land, Of all I own I take alone My sweet lute in my hand. Oh! who will thank me for my song. Reward my simple lay? Like lover's sighs it still shall rise To greet thee day by day. I sing of blooming flowers Made sweet by sun and rain; Of all the bliss of love's first kiss, And parting's cruel pain, Of the sad captive's longing Within his prison wall, Of hearts that sigh when none are nigh To answer to their call. My song begs for your pity, And gifts from out your store, And as I play my gentle lay I linger near your door. And if you hear my singing Within your palace, sire, Oh! give, I pray, this happy day To me my heart's desire. No sooner had the heathen king heard this touching song sung by such a lovely voice, than he had the singer brought before him. ""Welcome, O lute player,"" said he. ""Where do you come from?"" ""My country, sire, is far away across many seas. For years I have been wandering about the world and gaining my living by my music."" ""Stay here then a few days, and when you wish to leave I will give you what you ask for in your song -- your heart's desire."" So the lute player stayed on in the palace and sang and played almost all day long to the king, who could never tire of listening and almost forgot to eat or drink or to torment people. He cared for nothing but the music, and nodded his head as he declared, ""There's nothing like your playing and singing. It makes me feel as if some gentle hand had lifted every care and sorrow from me."" After three days the lute player came to take leave of the king. ""Well,"" said the king, ""what do you desire as your reward?"" ""Sire, give me one of your prisoners. You have so many in your prison, and I should be glad of a companion on my journeys. When I hear his happy voice as I travel along I shall think of you and thank you."" ""Come along then,"" said the king, ""choose whom you will."" And he took the lute player through the prison himself. The queen walked about amongst the prisoners, and at length she picked out her husband and took him with her on her journey. They were long on their way, but he never found out who she was, and she led him nearer and nearer to his own country. When they reached the frontier the prisoner said, ""Let me go now, kind lad; I am no common prisoner, but the king of this country. Let me go free and ask what you will as your reward."" ""Do not speak of reward,"" answered the lute player. ""Go in peace."" ""Then come with me, dear boy, and be my guest."" ""When the proper time comes I shall be at your palace,"" was the reply, and so they parted. The queen took a short way home, got there before the king and changed her dress. An hour later all the people in the palace were running to and fro and crying out, ""Our king has come back! Our king has returned to us."" The king greeted every one very kindly, but he would not so much as look at the queen. Then he called all his council and ministers together and said to them, ""See what sort of a wife I have. Here she is falling on my neck, but when I was pining in prison and sent her word of it she did nothing to help me."" And his council answered with one voice, ""Sire, when news was brought from you, the queen disappeared and no one knew where she went. She only returned today."" Then the king was very angry and cried, ""Judge my faithless wife! Never would you have seen your king again, if a young lute player had not delivered him. I shall remember him with love and gratitude as long as I live."" Whilst the king was sitting with his council, the queen found time to disguise herself. She took her lute, and slipping into the court in front of the palace she sang, clear and sweet: I sing the captive's longing Within his prison wall, Of hearts that sigh when none are nigh To answer to their call. My song begs for your pity, And gifts from out your store And as I play my gentle lay I linger near your door. And if you hear my singing Within your palace, sire, Oh! give, I pray, this happy day To me my heart's desire. As soon as the king heard this song he ran out to meet the lute player, took him by the hand and led him into the palace. ""Here,"" he cried, ""is the boy who released me from my prison. And now, my true friend, I will indeed give you your heart's desire."" ""I am sure you will not be less generous than the heathen king was, sire. I ask of you what I asked and obtained from him. But this time I don't mean to give up what I get. I want you -- yourself!"" And as she spoke she threw off her long cloak and everyone saw it was the queen. Who can tell how happy the king was? In the joy of his heart he gave a great feast to the whole world, and the whole world came and rejoiced with him for a whole week. I was there too, and ate and drank many good things. I shan't forget that feast as long as I live.",Russia,"Source (books.google.com): Andrew Lang, The Violet Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1901), pp. 70-76.

The Faithful Wife,0888,The Man Hitched to a Plow,"At Metz in Lorraine there lived a noble knight by the name of Alexander with his beautiful and virtuous wife Florentina. This knight vowed to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Grave. Unable to dissuade him from this journey, his sorrowful wife made for him a white shirt with a red cross and asked him to wear it. The knight then journeyed abroad and was captured by the infidels. He and his unfortunate companions were hitched to a plow and under the blows of a whip were forced to till the fields until blood ran from their bodies. Miraculously, only the shirt that Alexander had received from his wife and which he always wore remained clean and unstained. Rain, sweat, and blood did it no harm, nor did it tear. The Sultan himself learned of this rare circumstance, and he asked the slave precisely about his name, where he was from, and who had given him the shirt. The knight told him everything, adding, ""I have the shirt from my virtuous wife. That it remains so white proves to me her continuing faithfulness and chastity."" The pagan, his curiosity aroused by this news, resolved to secretly send one of his people to Metz who should spare neither money nor property in order to seduce the knight's wife, and thus determine if the shirt's color would change. The foreigner journeyed to Lorraine, scouted out the wife, then reported to her how miserable her husband was in the pagan land. This greatly saddened her, but she remained steadfastly virtuous. The emissary spent all his money in his unsuccessful attempts to seduce her, then returned to Turkey. Soon afterward Florentina dressed herself as a pilgrim, took up her harp, which she played very well, and set forth following foreign pagan. She caught up with him in Venice, then traveled with him to the land of the pagans, without his recognizing her in her disguise. Arriving at the pagan king's court, the pilgrim so captured him with singing and playing that great presents were offered to her. Rejecting them all, the pilgrim requested one of the captured Christians who were plowing. The request was granted, and Florentina, unrecognized, went to the prisoners, coming finally to the plow where her husband was hitched. Then she requested and received this prisoner, and together they journeyed safely across the sea until they arrived home in Germany. While still a two days' journey from Metz, the pilgrim said to Alexander, ""Brother, our paths part here. As a remembrance give me a little piece from your shirt, whose miracle I have heard so much about, so that I can tell and convince others about it."" The knight agreed to this, cut a piece from the shirt and gave it to the pilgrim. Then they parted. However, Florentina took a shorter way and arrived in Metz one whole day earlier than he did. She put on her accustomed women's clothes and awaited her husband's arrival. Alexander greeted his wife most tenderly, but soon afterward his friends and relatives began whispering to him that Florentina had traveled about the world for twelve months, leading an immoral life and letting no one hear from her. Alexander, burning with anger, ordered a feast where he publicly accused his wife of unbecoming behavior. Saying nothing, she left the room, went to her chamber, put on the pilgrim's garb that she had worn at that time, took up her harp, and then reappeared. Holding the piece cut from his shirt in her hand, she proved that she had been the pilgrim who had redeemed him from the plow. Then all her accusers fell silently at her feet, and her husband tearfully begged her for forgiveness.",France / Germany,"Source (books.google.com): Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Der Mann im Pflug,"" Deutsche Sagen, herausgegeben von den Brüdern Grimm, vol. 2 (Berlin: In der Nicolaischen Buchhandlung, 1818), no. 531, pp. 277-80.

The Faithful Wife,0888,The Tsaritsa Harpist,"It may be far, it may be short, he at last reached that distant land where the Jews crucified Christ. And in that country then the accursed king was the ruler. This king saw the tsar, and he bade him be seized and lodged in the dungeon. There were many tortures in that dungeon for him. At night he must sit in chains, and in the morning the accursed king used to put a horse-collar on him and make him drive the plough until the evening. This was the torment in which the tsar lived for three whole years, and he had no idea how he should tear himself away or send any news of himself to his tsaritsa. And he sought for some occasion. And he wrote her this little line: ""Sell,"" he said, ""all my possessions and come to redeem me from my misfortune."" When the tsaritsa received the letter she read it through and said to herself, ""How can I redeem the tsar? If I go myself, the accursed king will receive me and will take me to himself as a wife. If I send one of the ministers, I can place no reliance on him."" So what did she advise? She cut off her red hair, went and disguised herself as a wandering musician, took her gusli, and never told anybody, and so set out on her road and way. She arrived at the accursed king's courtyard and began to play the gusli so finely as had never been heard or listened to for ages. When the king heard such wonderful music he summoned the harpist into the palace. ""Hail, guslyar! From what land have you come? From what kingdom?"" asked the king. ""I do not journey far in the wide white world: I rejoice men's hearts, and I feed myself."" ""Stay with me one day and another day, and a third, and I will reward you generously."" So the guslyar stayed on, and played for an entire day in front of the king, and he could never hear enough of her. ""What wonderful music! Why, it drove away all weariness and grief as though at a breath."" So the guslyar stayed with the king three days, and, was going to say farewell. ""What reward can I offer you for your labour? "" asked the king. ""Oh, your majesty, give me one prisoner who has sat long in the prison. I must have a companion on the road! I wish to go to foreign kingdoms, and I have no one with whom I can exchange a word."" ""Certainly! Select whom you will,"" said the king, and he led the guslyar into the prison. The guslyar looked at the prisoners, selected the tsar, and they went out to roam together. As they were journeying on to their own kingdom the tsar said, ""Let me go, good man, for I am no simple prisoner, I am the tsar himself. I will pay you ransom for as much as you will; I will grudge you neither money nor service."" ""Go with God,"" said the guslyar. ""I do not need you at all."" ""Well, come to me as my guest."" ""When the time shall come, I will be there."" So they parted, and each set out on his own way. The tsaritsa went by a circuitous route, reached home before her husband, took off her guslyar's dress and arrayed herself like an empress. In about one hour cries rang out and the attendants came up to the palace, for the tsar had arrived. The tsaritsa ran out to meet him, and he greeted them all, but he did not look at her. He greeted the ministers and said, ""Look, gentlemen, what a wife mine is! Now she flings herself on my neck, but when I sat in prison and sent her a letter to sell all my goods and to redeem me she did nothing. Of what was she thinking if she so forgot her liege husband?"" And the ministers answered the tsar, ""Your majesty, on the very day the tsaritsa received your letter she vanished no one knows where, and has been away all this time, and she has only just appeared in the palace."" Then the tsar was very angry and commanded, ""My ministers, do ye judge my unfaithful wife according to justice and to truth. Where has she been roaming in the white world? Why did she not try to redeem me? You would never have seen your tsar again for ages of eternity, if a young guslyar had not arrived, for whom I am going to pray God, and I do not grudge giving him half my kingdom."" In the meantime the tsaritsa got off her throne and arrayed herself as the harpist, went into the courtyard and began to play the gusli. The tsar heard, ran to meet her, seized the musician by the hand, led her into the palace and said to his court, ""This is the guslyar who rescued me from my confinement."" The guslyar then flung off his outer garment, and they then all recognised the tsaritsa. Then the tsar was overjoyed and for his joy he celebrated a feast which lasted seven whole days.",Russia,"Source (books.google.com): Russian Folk-Tales, translated from the Russian by Leonard A.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,All-Kinds-of-Fur,"Once upon a time there was a king whose wife was the most beautiful woman in the world, with hair of pure gold. Together they had a daughter, and she was as beautiful as her mother, and she had the same golden hair. The queen became ill, and when she felt that she was about to die, she called the king to her side and asked him not to marry anyone following her death, unless she was just as beautiful as she, and unless her hair was just as golden as hers. The king made this promise, and she died. For a long time the king was so grieved that he did not think about a second wife, but finally his councilors advised him to marry again. He sent messengers to all the princesses, but none was as beautiful as the deceased queen, and such golden hair could not be found anywhere in the world. Then one day the king's glance fell on his daughter, and he saw that she looked just like her mother, and that she had the same golden hair. He thought to himself, ""You will never find anyone in the world this beautiful. You will have to marry your daughter."" And in that instant he felt such a strong love for her, that he immediately announced his decision to his councilors. They tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. The princess was horrified at his godless intentions, but because she was clever, she told the king that he should first get her three dresses: one as golden as the sun, one as white as the moon, one that glistened like the stars. Further, he was to get her a coat made from a thousand kinds of fur. Every animal in the kingdom would have to give up a piece of its skin for it. The king was so fervent in his desires, that he had his huntsmen capture animals from across the entire kingdom. They were skinned, and a coat was made from their pelts. Thus, it did not take long before he brought the princess everything that she had asked for. The princess said that she would marry him the next day. That night she sought out the presents that she had received from her fiancé: a golden ring, a little golden spinning wheel, and a little golden yarn reel. She put the three dresses into a nutshell, blackened her hands and face with soot, put on the coat of all kinds of fur, and left. She walked the entire night until she came to a great forest. She would be safe there. Because she was tired, she sat down in a hollow tree and fell asleep. She was still asleep the next day when the king, her fiancé, came to this forest to hunt. His dogs ran up to the tree and sniffed at it. The king sent his huntsmen to see what kind of animal was in the tree. They came back and said that it was a strange animal, the likes of which they had never seen before. It had every kind of fur on its skin, and it was lying there asleep. The king ordered them to capture it and to tie it onto the back of his carriage. As the huntsmen were doing this, they saw that it was a girl. They tied her onto the back of the carriage and rode home with her. ""All-Kinds-of-Fur,"" they said, ""you are good for the kitchen. You can carry water and wood, and clean out the ashes."" Then they gave her a little stall beneath the steps, where the light of day never shone, and said, ""This is where you can live and sleep."" So she had to help the cook in the kitchen. She plucked chickens, tended the fire, gathered vegetables, and did all the dirty work. Because she did very well at all this, the cook was good to her, and in the evening he often invited her in and gave her something to eat from the leftovers. Before the king went to bed, she had to go upstairs and pull off his boots. When she had pulled them off, he always threw them at her head. Poor All-Kinds-of-Fur lived like this for a long time. Oh, you beautiful maiden, what will become of you? Once there was a ball at the castle, and All-Kinds-of-Fur thought that she might see her fiancé once again, so she went to the cook and asked him if he would allow her to go upstairs a little and look in at the splendor from the doorway. ""Go ahead,"" said the cook, ""but do not stay longer than a half hour. You still have to clean out the ashes tonight."" Then All-Kinds-of-Fur took her little oil lamp and went to her stall where she washed off the soot. Her beauty came forth just like blossoms in the springtime. She took off the fur coat, opened up the nut and took out the dress that glistened like the sun. She put it on and went upstairs. Everyone made room for her, and thought that a noble princess had entered the hall. The king immediately invited her to dance, and as he danced with her, he thought how closely this unknown princess resembled his own fiancée. The longer he looked at her, the stronger the resemblance. He was almost certain that this was his fiancée, and at the end of the dance, he was going to ask her. However, when they finished dancing, she bowed, and before the king knew what was happening, she disappeared. He asked the watchmen, but none of them had seen the princess leave the castle. She had run quickly to her stall, taken off the dress, blackened her hands and face, and put on the fur coat once again. Then she went to the kitchen to clean out the ashes, but the cook said, ""Leave them until morning. I want to go upstairs and have a look at the dance. You make some soup for the king, but don't let any hairs fall into it, or there will be nothing more to eat for you."" All-Kinds-of-Fur made some bread soup for the king, then she put the golden ring in it that he had given her. When the ball was over, the king had his bread soup brought to him. It tasted better than any he had ever eaten. When he was finished, he found the ring on the bottom of the bowl. Looking at it carefully, he saw that it was his engagement ring. Astonished, he could not understand how it had gotten there. He summoned the cook, who then became very angry with All-Kinds-of-Fur. ""You must have let a hair fall into the soup,"" he said. ""If you did, there will be blows for you."" However, when the cook went upstairs, the king asked him who had made the soup, because it had been better than usual. The king had to confess that it had been All-Kinds-of-Fur. Then the king had her sent up to him. ""Who are you?"" he asked upon her arrival. ""What are you doing in my castle, and where did you get the ring that was lying in the soup?"" She answered, ""I am only a poor child whose father and mother are dead. I have nothing, and I am good for nothing more than having boots thrown at my head. And I know nothing about the ring."" With that she ran away. Soon there was another ball. All-Kinds-of-Fur again asked the cook to allow her to go upstairs. The cook gave his permission, but only for a half hour, because by then she would have to be back in the kitchen to make the king's bread soup. All-Kinds-of-Fur went to her stall, washed herself clean, and took out the moon-dress. It was purer and brighter than newly fallen snow. When she arrived upstairs the dance had just begun. The king extended his hand to her, and danced with her, and no longer doubted that this was his fiancée, for no one else in the world had such golden hair. However, the princess immediately slipped out when the dance ended, and the king, in spite of his great effort, could not find her. Further, he had not spoken a single word with her. She was All-Kinds-of-Fur once again, with blackened hands and face. She took her place in the kitchen and made bread soup for the king, while the cook went upstairs to have a look. When the soup was ready, she put the golden spinning wheel in it. The king ate the soup, and thought that it was even better this time. When he found the golden spinning wheel, he was even more astonished, because it had been a present from him to his fiancée some time ago. The cook was summoned again, and then All-Kinds-of-Fur, but once again she answered by saying that she knew nothing about it, and that she was there only to have boots thrown at her head. For the third time, the king held a ball. He hoped that his fiancée would come again, and he would not let her escape this time. All-Kinds-of-Fur again asked the cook to allow her to go upstairs, but he scolded her, saying, ""You are a witch. You are always putting things in the soup. And you can cook better than I can."" But because she begged so, and promised to behave herself, he gave her permission to go upstairs for a half hour. She put on the dress of stars. It glistened like stars in the night. She went upstairs and danced with the king, and he thought that he had never seen her more beautiful. While dancing, he slipped a ring onto her finger. He had ordered that it should be a very long dance. He could not bring himself to speak to her, nor could he keep her from escaping. As soon as the dance ended, she jumped into the crowd and disappeared before he could turn around. She ran to her stall. Because she had been gone more than a half hour, she quickly took off her dress, and in her rush she failed to blacken herself entirely. One finger remained white. When she returned to the kitchen, the cook had already left. She quickly made some bread soup and put the golden yarn reel into it. The king found it, just as he had found the ring and the golden spinning wheel, and now he knew for sure that his fiancée was nearby, for no one else could have had these presents. All-Kinds-of-Fur was summoned. Once again she tried to make an excuse and then run away, but as she ran by, the king noticed a white finger on her hand, and he held her fast. He found the ring that he had slipped onto her finger, and then he ripped off her fur coat. Her golden hair flowed out, and he saw that it was his dearly beloved fiancée. The cook received a generous reward. Then they got married and lived happily until they died.","Version of 1812 Germany, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm","Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Allerlei-Rauh,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, 1st ed.

The Princess Who Would Not Marry Her Father (Portugal, Consiglieri Pedroso). Incest, one of our strongest taboos, has, until our own era, largely escaped exposure and discussion on the printed page. Publishers of folktales dealing with incest have gotten around the taboo in various ways. One of the most disingenuous solutions was used in the following passage from a nineteenth-century English ""translation"" of the Grimms' ""All-Kinds-of-Fur"": Now, the King had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her dead mother, and had just such golden hair. One day when she had grown up, her father looked at her, and saw that she was exactly like her mother, so he said to his councilors, ""I will marry my daughter to one of you, and she shall be queen, for she is exactly like her dead mother, and when I die her husband shall be king."" But when the Princess heard of her father's decision, she was not at all pleased, and said to him, ""Before I do your bidding, I must have three dresses; one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars. Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.""

Other versions of the story (including later Grimm editions) make it abundantly clear that the fiancé mentioned here is a different king, not her own father. Beginning with the edition of 1819, the Grimms omitted the episode describing how the young king threw his boots at the heroine's head. The Grimms obviously wanted to de-emphasize the abusive nature of the relationship between the two lovers. However, most versions of the tale describe how the ""hero"" belittles, and possibly beats the woman he will later marry. Link to an English translation of the version of 1857: All-Kinds-of-Fur.",NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,All-Kinds-of-Fur,"""How can you take me for a wife,"" said the girl, ""for I am your daughter."" ""That is all the same to me. I want to marry you."" ""That is entirely impossible!"" said the girl. ""Just go to the bishop and listen to what he says. If he says that you are right, then take me in God's name."" So the king went to the bishop and asked, ""If someone has a lamb that he himself has cared for and raised, is it better that he should eat it, or that another person should eat it?"" ""No,"" answered the bishop, ""it is better for the person to eat it who raised it."" Then the king went back to his daughter and said, ""He told me that I may take you."" ""If he really told you that you make take me, then take me in God's name. But first make me two dresses of pure gold, and fill the pockets with ducats. Also make a bed for me, and a shaft that goes ten fathoms deep into the earth."" When the king had done all this, the girl took the dresses, climbed into the bed, then rode in into the shaft, saying, ""Earth, open further."" And the earth opened further, and she rode one until she came out at another place, and there she remained. A prince was hunting there, and he found the girl, wrapped in an animal skin. He approached her and asked, ""Are you a human?"" She answered, ""Yes, I am a human. May I go with you?"" He replied, ""For all I care you may come with me."" He took her with him and let her herd the geese. One day the king gave a feast, and the women began to dance. Then the girl slipped out of her animal skin and went to the ball in her golden dress, and danced. The prince saw her and said to himself,"" Who can that be? When she leaves the ball, I will follow her."" When the ball was over the girl left, and the prince crept after her. She noticed him, and she began to run, and he ran after her. Then the girl took a handful of ducats and threw them to the ground. While the prince was gathering up the gold she slipped away and hid herself in her animal skin. Then the prince said, ""Tomorrow I will give another feast, in order to see who she is."" The next day at the ball the girl came again and danced, and when she left the ball the prince ran after her. While running away she lost a shoe, and while the prince was picking it up she escaped half barefoot, then hid herself again in her animal skin. The prince took the shoe and tried it onto all the girls in order to see whom it fitted, but he could not find the right one. When the servant girls were taking wash water to the king before he ate, the girl split her animal skin a little at her knee so that her gold dress was visible. Then she went to the servant girls and said that she would like to take the water to the king. But they said, ""What? You, a goose girl want to take water to the king?"" ""What is the matter?"" asked the king. ""The goose girl want to bring your water."" ""Then let her do so. Just let her come."" When she knelt down the golden dress shone through the slit.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Ass'-Skin,"The king said to her, ""Are you like your name?"" and she said, ""Yes."" She stopped there seven years. Her master gave her all the keys, even that of the treasure. One day, when the king and queen were out, Faithful goes to the fountain, and she sees seven robbers coming out of the house. Judge what a state this poor girl was in! She runs straight to the treasury, and sees that more than half the treasure is missing. She did not know what would become of her -- she was all of a tremble. When the king and queen came home she told them what had happened, but they would not believe her, and they put her in prison. She stays there a year. She kept saying that she was not in fault, but they would not believe her. The king condemns her to death, and sends her with four men to the forest to kill her, telling them to bring him her heart. They go off, but these men thought it a pity to kill this young girl, for she was very pretty, and she told them that she was innocent of this robbery; and they say to her, ""If you will not come any more into this land, we will spare your life."" She promises them that she will not be seen again in those parts. The men see an ass, and they tell her that they will carry its heart to the king. The young girl said to them, ""Flay this ass, I pray you; and, in order that no one may know me, I will never take this skin off me."" The men do so, and go off to the king, and the young girl goes to look for some shelter. At nightfall she finds a beautiful house. She asks if they want some one to keep the geese. They tell her, ""Yes, yes, yes."" They put her along with the geese, and tell her that she must go with them every day to such a field. She went out very early in the morning and came back late. It was the king's house, and it was the queen-mother and her son who lived there. After some time there appeared to her one day an old woman, who called to her, ""Faithful, you have done penance enough. The son of the king is going to give some grand feasts, and you must go to them. This evening you will ask madame permission, and you will tell her that you will give her all the news of the ball if she will let you go for a little while. And, see, here is a nut. All the dresses and things you want will come out of that. You will break it as you go to the place of the festival."" That evening she asked permission of her mistress to go and see the festival which the king is going to give, for a short time only, and that she will return directly and tell her all that she has seen there. Her mistress said, ""Yes."" That evening she goes then. On her way she breaks the nut, and there comes out of it a silver robe. She puts it on, and goes there, and immediately she enters all the world looks at her. The king is bewitched, he does not quit her for an instant, and they always dance together. He pays no attention at all to the other young ladies. They enjoy the refreshments very much. Some friends of the king call him, and he has to go there; and in this interval Faithful makes her escape to the house. She tells the queen how that a young girl had come to the ball, how she had dazzled everybody, and especially the king, who paid attention to her alone, but that she had escaped. When the son comes to the house, his mother says to him, ""She escaped from you then, your young lady? She did not care for you, doubtless."" He says to his mother, ""Who told you that?"" ""Ass'-Skin; she wished to go and see it."" The king goes to where Faithful was and gives her two blows with his slipper, saying to her, ""If you return there again I will kill you on the spot."" The next day Ass'-Skin goes with her geese, and there appears to her again the old woman. She tells her that she ought to go to the ball again this evening -- that her mistress would give her permission. ""Here is a walnut; you have there all that is necessary to dress yourself with. The king will ask you your name: Braf-le-mandoufle [Beaten with the slipper]."" In the evening she asks permission of her mistress, but she is astonished (at her asking), and says to her, ""You do not know what the king has said -- that if he catches you he will kill you on the spot?"" ""I am not afraid. He will be sure not to catch me."" ""Go, then."" She goes off, and on the way she breaks the walnut, and there comes out of it a golden robe. She goes in. The king comes with a thousand compliments, and asks her how she had escaped the evening before without saying anything to him, and that he had been very much hurt at it. They amuse themselves thoroughly. The king has eyes for her alone. He asks her her name. She tells him, ""Braf-le-mandoufle."" They feast themselves well, and some friends having called to him he goes to them, and the young lady escapes. Ass'-Skin goes to tell the queen that yesterday evening's young lady had come, but still more beautiful -- that she had escaped in the very middle of the ball. She goes off to her geese. The king comes to his house. His mother says to him, ""She came then, the young lady you love? But she only loves you so-so, since she has gone off in this fashion."" ""Who told you that?"" ""Ass'-Skin."" He goes off to her and gives her two kicks with his slipper, and says to her, ""Woe to you if you go there again; I will kill you on the very spot."" She goes off to her geese, and the old woman comes to her again and tells her to ask permission again for this evening -- that she must go to the dance. She gives her a peach, and tells her that she will have there all that is necessary to dress herself with. She goes then to ask her mistress if she will give her permission, like last night, to go to the ball. She says to her, ""Yes, yes, I will give you leave. But are you not afraid lest the king should catch you? He has said that he will kill you if you go there."" ""I am not afraid, because I am sure that he will not catch me. Yesterday he looked for me again, but he could not catch me."" She goes off then. On the way she opens her peach, and finds there a dress entirely of diamonds, and if she was beautiful before, judge what she is now! She shone like the sun. The king was plunged into joy when he saw her. He was in an ecstasy. He did not wish to dance, but they sat down at their ease on beautiful arm-chairs, and with their refreshments before them they passed such a long time together. The king asked her to give him her promise of marriage. The young lady gives him her word, and the king takes his diamond ring off his finger and gives it to her. His friends call him away to come quickly to see something very rare, and off he goes, leaving his lady. She takes advantage of this opportunity to escape. She tells her mistress all that has passed -- how that this young Lady had come with a dress of diamonds, that all the world was dazzled by her beauty, that they could not even look at her she shone so brightly, that the king did not know where he was for happiness, that they had given each other their promise of marriage, and that the king had given her his diamond ring, but that the best thing of all was that today again she has escaped him. The king comes in at that very instant. His mother says to him, ""She has not, she certainly has not, any wish for you. She has gone off with your diamond ring. Where will you go and look for her? You do not know where she lives. Where will you ask for a young lady who has such a name as 'Braf-le-mandoufle!' She has given you her promise of marriage too; but she does not wish to have you, since she has acted like that."" Our king did not even ask his mother who has told her that. He went straight to bed thoroughly ill, and so Ass'-Skin did not have her two kicks that evening. The queen was in great trouble at seeing her son ill like that. She was continually turning over in her head who this young lady might be. She said to her son, ""Is this young lady our Ass'-Skin ? How else could she have known that you had given your promise to one another, and that you had given her the ring too? She must have been very close to you. Did you see her?"" He says, ""No,"" but remains buried in thought. His mother says, ""She has a very pretty face under her ass'-skin."" And she says that she must send for her, and that he must have a good look at her too ; that he shall have some broth brought up by her. She sends for Ass'-Skin to the kitchen, has the broth made for her son, and Ass'-Skin puts in the middle of the bread the ring which the king had given her. The lady had her well dressed, and she goes to the king. The king, after having seen her, was still doubtful. He drank his broth; but when he puts the bread into his mouth he finds something (hard), and is very much astonished at seeing his ring. He was ill no longer. He goes and runs to his mother to tell her his joy that he has found his lady. He wishes to marry directly, and all the kings of the neighbourhood are invited to the feast; and, while they were dining, everyone had some fine news to relate. They ask the bride, too, if she had not something to tell them. She says, ""Yes,"" but that she cannot tell what she knows that it would not please all at the table. Her husband tells her to speak out boldly; he draws his sword, and says, ""Whosoever shall speak a word shall be run through with this sword."" She then tells how a poor girl was servant at a king's house; how she remained there seven years; that they liked her very much, and treated her with confidence, even to giving her the keys of the treasure. One day, when the king and his wife were out, robbers entered, and stole almost all the treasure. The king would not believe that robbers had come. He puts the young girl in prison for a whole year, and at the end of that time he sends her to execution, telling the executioners to bring her heart to the house. The executioners were better than the king; they believed in her innocence, and, after having killed an ass, they carried its heart to the king; ""and for the proof, it is I who was servant to this king."" The bridegroom says to her, ""Who can this king be? Is it my uncle?"" The lady says, "" I do not know if he is your uncle, but it is that gentleman there."" The bridegroom takes his sword and kills him on the spot, saying to his wife, ""You shall not be afraid of him any more."" They lived very happily. Some time afterwards they had two children, a boy and a girl. When the elder was seven years old he died, telling his father and mother that he was going to heaven to get a place there ready for them. At the end of a week the other child dies too, and she says to them that she, too, is going to heaven, and that she will keep their place ready; that they, too, would quickly go to them. And, as she had said, at the end of a year, at exactly the very same time, both the gentleman and lady died, and they both went to heaven.","Basque, Wentworth Webster","Source: Wentworth Webster, Basque Legends, 2nd edition (London: Griffith and Farran, 1879), pp. 158-65.","All-Kinds-of-Fur, also known as ""Allerleirauh"" (Germany, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, version of 1812).

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,"Broomthrow, Brushthrow, Combthrow","The count's and his daughter's sorrow and grief were endless. After the mother's burial, the father and his child locked themselves in their rooms and were seldom seen. After a month had passed, the count had his daughter brought to his room and said to her, ""Dear child, you know how much I loved your mother. I cannot live without a wife. Therefore I am going out into the world to seek a wife who -- like your blessed mother -- has a golden cross on her forehead. If I do not find such a woman within a year and a day, then I will marry you."" When Adelheid heard these words she was very upset, and she silently withdrew. The next morning Count Rudolf departed, promising to return within a year and a day. When Adelheid was alone she considered whether or not it would be possible for her father to find a woman with such a cross. Then she remembered that her mother had once told her that except for her and Adelheid, no one on the entire earth had such a cross. She decided to go away. She would rather earn her bread with the work of her own hands than to eat the finest tidbits at her father's table as his wife. She entrusted one of her loyal servants with her plan, and they made preparations to depart. She secretly loaded her valuables, her jewelry, her gold, and her clothes into several large carriages. During the night she drove off with them, accompanied by her servant Gotthold and several others who were loyal to her. They came to a large city where she rented a house and moved into it with her servants. Adelheid had often stated that she wanted to earn her bread with the work of her own hands. Therefore Gotthold sought a position for his mistress in the city. He learned that there was an opening for a kitchen maid in the castle of Prince Adolf. Thus he went to the chief cook and asked him if he would be willing to hire his niece, for that is what he called the countess. As he talked further with the chief cook, Gotthold recognized in him a friend whom he had not seen for many years. He told him that his brother had died, leaving a daughter in his care. The chief cook agreed to hire her. The loyal servant happily returned to the countess and remained in the rented house. Adelheid now dyed her face, neck, and hands brown; covered her golden cross and her hair with a large head-scarf; took off her magnificent robes, putting on instead old, dirty, torn clothing; and presented herself to the chief cook. She was given a small room where she could sleep and keep her things. Slowly she grew accustomed to her job, even though she was exhausted by the hard work. Until now she had not yet seen the prince. One day he invited all his friends and acquaintances to a great ball. On the morning of the ball, Adelheid was sweeping the staircase, when the prince, without being seen by her, walked up and tipped over the dust pail, thus dirtying his boots. As she was fleeing he angrily ripped the broom from her hands and threw it at her. That evening as the hall was filling with people, the young countess went to the chief cook and asked him for permission to go to the ball. He replied, ""No, I cannot allow you to do that. What if the prince were to find out!"" Adelheid continued to beg, until he finally said, ""Just go. But don't stay too late, and if you get anything, bring some back for me as well."" Now she went to Gotthold's house, changed her clothes, washed away the color, and ordered up a splendid carriage in which she rode to the prince's. When the guests saw the splendid carriage approaching in the distance they all hurried outside and said, ""A foreign lady! A beautiful lady!"" The prince hurried toward her, lifted her from her carriage, and led her up the stairs. She had to dance with him the entire evening and to sit next to him at the table. After eating, he asked her what her name was and where she came from. ""My name is Adelheid, and I come from Broomthrow,"" replied the countess. At twelve o'clock she left, and with her the majority of guests. Arriving at home she quickly got undressed, colored herself brown, and took three gold pieces which she gave to the chief cook, claiming that she had stood behind a door and had received the gold from an old woman. The next morning the prince looked for Broomthrow on his maps, but he could not find it. He wanted to ask her about her home city once again, but because he did not know where she lived he invited his friends to a second ball. On the morning of the second ball Adelheid was brushing her clothing when the prince, without being seen, came up the stairs. She turned around and dropped the brush, which fell onto the prince's feet. Angrily Adolf picked up the brush and threw it at the embarrassed countess's head. That evening the chief cook once again allowed her to go the ball, and she took advantage of his permission. At the ball Adolf told her that he had not been able to find Broomthrow. ""How could you be looking for Broomthrow?"" she replied. ""I said Brushthrow."" Once again they danced together, and as midnight approached she went home. She brought the chief cook a gold band, claiming that she had received it as a gift. The next morning the prince looked for Brushthrow, but could not find it. He then invited his friends and acquaintances to a third ball, which was to be even more magnificent than the first two. On the eve of the ball, shortly before the festivities were to begin, Adelheid, contrary to custom, was combing her hair in the castle. The prince, displeased because the foreign lady had not arrived yet, walked up the stairs just as the countess dropped her comb. Prince Adolf picked it up and threw it at the kitchen servant's head. She quickly withdrew, changed her clothes, and went to the ball. At the table the prince said that he had not been able to find Brushthrow anywhere. ""I can believe that,"" she said. ""I called the place Combthrow."" He didn't want to believe her, but she argued with him until he finally gave in. Before she left he placed a ring on her finger, without her noticing it. The next morning the prince was not well, and he asked a chief cook to make soup for him. The latter announced this in the kitchen, and Adelheid asked for permission to make the soup. But he said, ""If you put something in the soup that doesn't belong there, then I am the one who will be punished."" She replied, ""I will not put anything wrong in it."" She made the soup, and without being seen, she threw the prince's ring into the soup. The prince poured the soup into a dish and heard something jingle. He felt around and fished out the ring. Amazed, he then asked who had made the soup. ""The kitchen maid"" was the answer. Adolph ordered his servant, ""Bring her here."" She hurriedly put on the dress that she had worn the previous evening, and when the prince saw her, he recognized his dance partner. She now had to tell him her life story, and soon afterward he married her. In the meantime her father had come home, and when he discovered that his daughter had already married, he had to accept his fate.","Austria, Theodor Vernaleken","Source: Theodor Vernaleken, Österreichische Kinder- und Hausmärchen: Treu nach mündlicher Überlieferung (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1864), no. 33, pp. 172-77.",NA,NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Cinder Blower,"Now in another land there lived a prince who had heard of the girl's beauty. Taking the magic wand in her hand and the dresses over her shoulder, she wished herself to the vicinity of the prince's castle. She immediately found herself in the castle garden. Then she wished for herself a chest in an oak tree in the garden, put her dresses in it, put on the crow-skin coat and went to the castle kitchen where she presented herself as a poor boy looking for work. ""I can use you,"" said the cook. ""You can be the cinder blower."" A few days later the prince came to the kitchen with some freshly killed game. She saw him and liked him beyond measure. Soon afterward there was a wedding in a nearby castle, and the prince went to it. Many people went there to look on at the dance. Cinder Blower asked the cook for permission to observe. She ran to the oak tree, put on the silver dress, and wished herself a carriage in which she rode to the castle. The prince saw her and danced with her, but after a few dances she disappeared. Seating herself in her carriage she said, The next evening there was another dance, and Cinder Blower again asked for permission to go. This time she put on the golden dress, then rode there in the carriage. The prince had been looking for her and was very happy when she arrived. While dancing with her he asked her where she lived. ""In Boot-Throw"" was her answer. She remained there one hour, and then disappeared. In vain the prince asked where Boot-Throw was. No one could tell him. Again that night the prince could not close his eyes, and the next day he was in an even worse mood than before. Cinder Blower was asked to brush his coat, but he did not like the way she did it, and finally he threw the brush at her head. The third evening Cinder Blower again asked for permission to look on at the dance, then put on her dress of precious stones. While dancing with her the prince asked her where she lived. ""In Brush-Throw,"" was her answer. ""Whoever you are,"" he said, ""take this ring from me."" She let him put the ring onto her finger. Then she tried to sneak away, but the prince carefully watched her and followed close behind her. She climbed out of her carriage near the oak tree. However, she did not have time to take off her dress, but quickly put on the crow-skin coat over it. The next morning when the cook was preparing the soup, Cinder Blower dropped the ring into it. The prince found it and asked the cook who had been in the kitchen. ""Only Cinder Blower and I,"" he answered. The prince summoned Cinder Blower and said, ""My head itches. Look and see if any vermin are there."" Cinder Blower obeyed, but when she stood before him, he saw the diamond dress glistening forth from beneath the worn-out crow-skin coat. Then he recognized her. ""Now you are mine,"" he said, and he made her his wife and they lived happily together until they died.",Karl Bartsch,"Source: Karl Bartsch, Sagen, Märchen und Gebräuche aus Meklenburg [Mecklenburg] (Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1879, vol. 1, pp. 479-481.","Kaiser Heinrich in Sudemer Mountain (Germany, A.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Doralice,"You must know, dear ladies, that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, according to the story I have heard repeated many times by my elders, had to wife a modest and prudent lady of good lineage, and by her he had a daughter who in beauty and grace outshone all the other ladies of Salerno; but it would have been well for Tebaldo if she had never seen the light, for in that case the grave misadventure which befell him would never have happened. His wife, young in years but of mature wisdom, when she lay a-dying besought her husband, whom she loved very dearly, never to take for his wife any woman whose finger would not exactly fit the ring which she herself wore; and the prince, who loved his wife no less than she loved him, swore by his head that he would observe her wish. After the good princess had breathed her last and had been honorably buried, Tebaldo indulged in the thought of wedding again, but he bore well in mind the promise he had made to his wife, and was firmly resolved to keep her saying. However, the report that Tebaldo, Prince of Salerno, was seeking another mate soon got noised abroad, and came to the ears of many maidens who, in worth and in estate, were no whit his inferiors; but Tebaldo, whose first care was to fulfil the wishes of his wife who was dead, made it a condition that any damsel who might be offered to him in marriage should first try on her finger his wife's ring, to see whether it fitted, and not having found one who fulfilled this condition -- the ring being always found too big for this and too small for that -- he was forced to dismiss them all without further parley. Now it happened one day that the daughter of Tebaldo, whose name was Doralice, sat at table with her father; and she, having espied her mother's ring lying on the board, slipped it on her finger and cried out, ""See my father, how well my mother's ring fits me!"" And the prince, when he saw what she had done, assented. But not long after this the soul of Tebaldo was assailed by a strange and diabolical temptation to take to wife his daughter Doralice, and for many days he lived tossed about between yea and nay. At last, overcome by the strength of this devilish intent, and fired by the beauty of the maiden, he one day called her to him and said, ""Doralice, my daughter, while your mother was yet alive, but fast nearing the end of her days, she besought me never to take to wife any woman whose finger would not fit the ring she herself always wore in her lifetime, and I swore by my head that I would observe this last request of hers. Wherefore, when I felt the time was come for me to wed anew, I made trial of many maidens, but not one could I find who could wear your mother's ring, except yourself. Therefore I have decided to take you for my wife, for thus I shall satisfy my own desire without violating the promise I made to your mother."" Doralice, who was as pure as she was beautiful, when she listened to the evil designs of her wicked father, was deeply troubled in her heart; but, taking heed of his vile and abominable lust, and fearing the effects of his rage, she made no answer and went out of his presence with an untroubled face. As there was no one whom she could trust so well as her old nurse, she repaired to her at once as the surest bulwark of her safety, to take counsel as to what she should do. The nurse, when she had heard the story of the execrable lust of this wicked father, spake words of comfort to Doralice, for she knew well the constancy and steadfast nature of the girl, and that she would be ready to endure any torment rather than accede to her father's desire, and promised to aid her in keeping her virginity unsullied by such terrible disgrace. After this the nurse thought of nothing else than how she might best find a way for Doralice out of this strait, planning now this and now that, but finding no method which gained her entire approval. She would fain have had Doralice take to flight and put long distance betwixt her and her father, but she feared the craft of Tebaldo, and lest the girl should fall into his hands after her flight, feeling certain that in such event he would put her to death. So while the faithful nurse was thus taking counsel with herself, she suddenly hit upon a fresh scheme, which was what I will now tell you. In the chamber of the dead lady there was a fair cassone, or clothes-chest, magnificently carved, in which Doralice kept her richest dresses and her most precious jewels, and this wardrobe the nurse alone could open. So she removed from it by stealth all the robes and the ornaments that were therein, and bestowed them elsewhere, placing in it a good store of a certain liquor which had such great virtue, that whosoever took a spoonful of it, or even less, could live for a long time without further nourishment. Then, having called Doralice, she shut her therein, and bade her remain in hiding until such time as God should send her better fortune, and her father be delivered from the bestial mood which had come upon him. The maiden, obedient to the good old woman's command, did all that was told her; and the father, still set upon his accursed design, and making no effort to restrain his unnatural lust, demanded every day what had become of his daughter; and, neither finding any trace of her, or knowing aught where she could be, his rage became so terrible that he threatened to have her killed as soon as he should find her. Early one morning it chanced that Tebaldo went into the room where the chest was, and as soon as his eye fell upon it, he felt, from the associations connected with it, that he could not any longer endure the sight of it, so he gave orders that it should straightway be taken out and placed elsewhere and sold, so that its presence might not bee an offence to him. The servants were prompt to obey their master's command, and, having taken the thing on their shoulders, they bore it away to the marketplace. It chanced that there was at that time in the city a rich dealer from Genoa, who, as soon as he caught sight of the sumptuously carved cassone, admired it greatly, and settled with himself that he would not let it go from him, however much he might have to pay for it. So, having accosted the servant who was charged with the sale of it, and learnt the price demanded, he bought it forthwith, and gave orders to a porter to carry it away and place it on board his ship. The nurse, who was watching the trafficking from a distance, was well pleased with the issue thereof, though she grieved sore at losing the maiden. Wherefore she consoled herself by reflecting that when it comes to the choice of evils it is ever wiser to avoid the greater. The merchant, having set sail from Salerno with his carven chest and other valuable wares, voyaged to the island of Britain, known to us today as England, and landed at a port near which the country was spread out in a vast plain. Before he had been there long, Genese, who had lately been crowned king of the island, happened to be riding along the seashore, chasing a fine stag, which, in the end, ran down to the beach and took to the water. The king, feeling wary and worn with the long pursuit, was fain to rest awhile, and, having caught sight of the ship, he sent to ask the master of it to give him something to drink; and the latter, feigning to be ignorant he was talking to the king, greeted Genese familiarly, and gave him a hearty welcome, finally prevailing upon him to go on board his vessel. The king, when he saw the beautiful clothes-chest so finely carved, was taken with a great longing to possess it, and grew so impatient to call it his own that every hour seemed like a thousand till he should be able to claim it. He then asked the merchant the price he asked for it, and was answered that the price was a very heavy one. The king, being now more taken than ever with the beautiful handicraft, would not leave the ship till he had arranged a price with the merchant, and, having sent for money enough to pay the price demanded, he took his leave, and straightway ordered the cassone to be borne to the palace and placed in his chamber. Genese, being yet over-young to wive, found his chief pleasure in going every day to the chase. Now that the cassone was transported into his bedroom, with the maiden Doralice hidden inside, she heard, as was only natural, all that went on in the king's chamber, and, in pondering over her past misfortunes, hoped that a happier future was in store for her. And as soon as the king had departed for the chase in the morning, and had left the room clear, Doralice would issue from the clothes-chest, and would deftly put the chamber in order, and sweep it, and make the bed. Then she would adjust the bed curtains, and put on the coverlet cunningly embroidered with fine pearls, and two beautifully ornamented pillows thereto. After this, the fair maiden strewed the bed with roses, violets, and other sweet-smelling flowers, mingled with Cyprian spices which exhaled a subtle odor and soothed the brain to slumber. Day after day Doralice continued to compose the king's chamber in this pleasant fashion, without being seen of anyone, and thereby gave Genese much gratification; for every day when he came back from the chase it seemed to him as if he was greeted by all the perfumes of the East. One day he questioned the queen his mother, and the ladies who were about her, as to which of them had so kindly and graciously adorned his room and decked the bed with roses and violets and sweet scents. They answered, one and all, that they had no part in all this, for every morning, when they went to put the chamber in order, they found the bed strewn with flowers and perfumes. Genese, when he heard this, determined to clear up the mystery, and the next morning gave out that he was going to hunt at a village ten leagues distant. But, in lieu of going forth, he quietly hid himself in the room, keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the door, and waiting to see what might occur. He had not been long on the watch before Doralice, looking more beautiful than the sun, came out of the cassone and began to sweep the room, and to straighten the carpets, and to deck the bed, and diligently to set everything in order, as was her wont. The beautiful maiden had no sooner done her kindly and considerate office, than she made as if she would go back to her hiding place. But the king, who had keenly taken note of everything, suddenly caught her by the hand, and, seeing that she was very fair, and fresh as a lily, asked her who she was; whereupon the trembling girl confessed that she was the daughter of a prince. She declared, however, that she had forgotten what was his name, on account of her long imprisonment in the cassone, and she would say nothing as to the reason why she had been shut therein. The king, after he had heard her story, fell violently in love with her, and, with the full consent of his mother, made her his queen, and had by her two fair children. In the meantime Tebaldo was still mastered by his wicked and treacherous passion, and, as he could find no trace of Doralice, search as he would, he began to believe that she must have been hidden in the coffer which he had caused to be sold, and that, having escaped his power, she might be wandering about from place to place. Therefore, with his rage will burning against her, he set himself to try whether perchance he might not discover her whereabouts. He attired himself as a merchant, and, having gathered together a great store of precious stones and jewels, marvelously wrought in gold, quitted Salerno unknown to anyone, and scoured all the nations and countries round about, finally meeting by hazard the trader who had originally purchased the clothes-chest. Of him he demanded whether he had been satisfied with his bargain, and into whose hands the chest had fallen, and the trader replied that he had sold the cassone to the King of England for double the price he had given for it. Tebaldo, rejoicing at this news, made his way to England, and when he had landed there and journeyed to the capital, he made a show of his jewels and golden ornaments, amongst which were some spindles and distaffs cunningly wrought, crying out the while, ""Spindles and distaffs for sale, ladies."" It chanced that one of the dames of the court, who was looking out of a window, heard this and saw the merchant and his goods; whereupon she ran to the queen and told her there was below a merchant who had for sale the most beautiful golden spindles and distaffs that ever were seen. The queen commanded him to be brought into the palace, and he came up the stairs into her presence, but she did not recognize him in his merchant's guise. Moreover, she was not thinking ever to behold her father again; but Tebaldo recognized his daughter at once. The queen, when she saw how fair was the work of the spindles and distaffs, asked of the merchant what price he put upon them. ""The prince is great,"" he answered, ""but to you I will give one of them for nothing, provided you suffer me to gratify a caprice of mine. This is that I may be permitted to sleep one night in the same room as your children."" The good Doralice, in her pure and simple nature, never suspected the accursed design of the feigned merchant, and, yielding to the persuasion of her attendants, granted his request. But before the merchant was led to the sleeping chamber, certain ladies of the court deemed it wise to offer him a cup of wine well drugged to make him sleep sound, and when night had come and the merchant seemed overcome with fatigue, one of the ladies conducted him into the chamber of the king's children, where there was prepared for him a sumptuous couch. Before she left him the lady said, ""Good man, are you not thirsty?"" ""Indeed I am,"" he replied; whereupon she handed him the drugged wine in a silver cup. But the crafty Tebaldo, while feigning to drink the wine, spilled it over his garments, and then lay down to rest. Now there was in the children's a side door through which it was possible to pass into the queen's apartment. At midnight, when all was still, Tebaldo stole through this, and, going up to the bed beside which the queen had left her clothes, he took away a small dagger, which he had marked the day before hanging from her girdle. Then he returned to the children's room and killed them both with the dagger, which he immediately put back into its scabbard, all bloody as it was. And having opened a window he let himself down by a cord. As soon as the shopmen of the city were astir, he went to a barber's and had his long beard taken off, for fear he might be recognized, and having put on different clothes he walked about the city without apprehension. In the palace the nurses went, as soon as they awakened, to suckle the children; but when they came to the cradles they found them both lying dead. Whereupon they began to scream and to weep bitterly, and to rend their hair and their garments, thus laying bare their breasts. The dreadful tiding came quickly to the ears of the king and queen, and they ran barefooted and in their nightclothes to the spot, and when they saw the dead bodies of the babes they wept bitterly. Soon the report of the murder of the two children was spread throughout the city, and, almost at the same time, it was rumored that there had just arrived a famous astrologer, who, by studying the courses of the various stars, could lay bare the hidden mysteries of the past. When this came to the ears of the king, he caused the astrologer to be summoned forthwith, and, when he was come into the royal presence, demanded whether or not he could tell the name of the murderer of the children. The astrologer replied that he could, and whispering secretly in the king's ear he said, ""Sire, let all the men and women of your court who are wont to wear a dagger at their side be summoned before you, and if amongst these you shall find one whose dagger is befouled with blood in its scabbard, that same will be the murderer of your children."" Wherefore the king at once gave command that all his courtiers should present themselves, and, when they were assembled, he diligently searched with his own hands to see if any one of them might have a bloody dagger at his side, but he could find none. Then he returned to the astrologer -- who was no other than Tebaldo himself -- and told him how his quest had been vain, and that all in the palace, save his mother and the queen, had been searched. To which the astrologer replied, ""Sire, search everywhere and respect no one, and then you will surely find the murderer."" So the king searched first his mother, and then the queen, and when he took the dagger which Doralice wore and drew it from the scabbard, he found it covered with blood. Then the king, convinced by this proof, turned to the queen and said to her, ""O, wicked and inhuman woman, enemy of your own flesh and blood, traitress to your own children! What desperate madness has led you to dye your hands in the blood of these babes? I swear that you shall suffer the full penalty fixed for such a crime."" But though the king in his rage would fain have sent her straightway to a shameful death, his desire for vengeance prompted him to dispose of her so that she might suffer longer and more cruel torment. Wherefore he commanded that she should be stripped and thus naked buried up to her chin in the earth, and that she should be well fed in order that she might linger long and the worms devour her flesh while she still lived. The queen, seasoned to misfortune in the past, and conscious of her innocence, contemplated her terrible doom with calmness and dignity. Tebaldo, when he learned that the queen had been adjudged guilty and condemned to a cruel death, rejoiced greatly, and, as soon as he had taken leave of the king, left England, quite satisfied with his work, and returned secretly to Salerno. Arrived there, he told to the old nurse the whole story of his adventures, and how Doralice had been sentenced to death by her husband. As she listened, the nurse feigned to be as pleased as Tebaldo himself, but in her heart she grieved sorely, overcome by this love which she had always borne towards the princess, and the next morning she took horse early and rode on day and night until she came to England. Immediately she repaired to the palace and went before the king, who was giving public audience in the great hall, and, having thrown herself at his feet, she demanded an interview on a matter which concerned the honor of his crown. The king granted her request, and took her by the hand and bade her rise. Then, when the rest of the company had gone and left them alone, the nurse thus addressed the king, ""Sire, know that Doralice, your wife, is my child. She is not, indeed, the fruit of my womb, but I nourished her at these breasts. She is innocent of the deed which is laid to her charge, and for which she is sentenced to a lingering and cruel death. And you, when you shall have learnt everything, and laid your hand upon the impious murderer, and understood the reason which moved him to slay your children, you will assuredly show her mercy and deliver her from these bitter and cruel torments. And if you find that I speak falsely in this, I offer myself to suffer the same punishment which the wretched Doralice is now enduring."" Then the nurse set forth fully from beginning to end the whole history of Doralice's past life; and the king, when he heard it, doubted not the truth of it, but forthwith gave orders that the queen, who was now more dead than alive, should be taken out of the earth; which was done at once, and Doralice, after careful nursing and ministration by physicians, was restored to health. Next day King Genese stirred up through all his kingdom mighty preparations for war, and gathered together a great army, which he dispatched to Salerno. After a short campaign the city was captured, and Tebaldo, bound hand and foot, taken back to England, where King Genese, wishing to know the whole sum of his guilt, had him put upon the rack, whereupon the wretched man made full confession. The next day he was conducted through the city in a cart drawn by four horses, and then tortured with red-hot pincers like Gano di Magazza, and after his body had been quartered, his flesh was thrown to be eaten of ravenous dogs. And this was the end of the impious wretch Tebaldo. And King Genese and Doralice his queen lived many years happily together, leaving at their death divers children in their place.","Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola","Source: The Facetious Nights of Straparola, vol. 1, translated by W.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Emperor Heinrich in Sudemer Mountain,"After his grief had subsided somewhat, he revealed to his own daughter, who was almost more beautiful than her mother, his sinful desire to marry her. She appropriately resisted him, finally convincing him to first to travel to the courts of all the kings and counts in Europe in search of a spouse more beautiful than she. He traveled far and wide, but finally returned with the news that a more beautiful woman could not be found anywhere. But still she resisted his pleas and his advances. Finally he set the condition that he would desist from his demands if she could create a blanket upon which all of the earths animals could be seen. She went into a small chapel in the upper city and fervently prayed to God, but she found no comfort in her prayers, so finally in despair she called upon the devil to come and help her. He appeared immediately, saying that he would bring the blanket to her, if she could remain awake in the chapel for three days and three nights. She brought her little dog into the chapel with her and spent the time ceaselessly praying. However, during the third night, just as morning was breaking, sleep almost overcame her. At that moment the devil approached, and her little dog, seeing him, pulled at her skirt so vigorously that she jumped up. The devil angrily dropped the blanket, furiously threw the little dog against church wall, and disappeared. She took the blanket to her father, who then was overcome by such powerful pain that he lost all will to live. He bewitched himself into the Sudemer Mountain near Goslar, whose watchtower is visible throughout the region. There he sits until the present day, and will return only when Goslar finds itself in great need, or when the Day of Judgment arrives.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Fair Maria Wood,"There was once a husband and wife who had but one child, a daughter. Now it happened that the wife fell ill and was at the point of death. Before dying she called her husband, and said to him, weeping, ""I am dying; you are still young; if you ever wish to marry again, be mindful to choose a wife whom my wedding ring fits; and if you cannot find a lady whom it fits well, do not marry."" Her husband promised that he would do so. When she was dead he took off her wedding ring and kept it until he desired to marry again. Then he sought for some one to please him. He went from one to another, but the ring fitted no one. He tried so many but in vain. One day he thought of calling his daughter, and trying the ring on her to see whether it fitted her. The daughter said, ""It is useless, dear father; you cannot marry me, because you are my father."" He did not heed her, put the ring on her finger, and saw that it fitted her well, and wanted to marry his daughter nolens volens. She did not oppose him, but consented. The day of the wedding, he asked her what she wanted. She said that she wished four silk dresses, the most beautiful that could be seen. He, who was a gentleman, gratified her wish and took her the four dresses, one handsomer than the other, and all the handsomest that had ever been seen. ""Now, what else do you want?"" said he. ""I want another dress, made of wood, so that I can conceal myself in it."" And at once he had this wooden dress made. She was well pleased. She waited until one day her husband was out of sight, put on the wooden dress, and under it the four silk dresses, and went away to a certain river not far off, and threw herself in it. Instead of sinking and drowning, she floated, for the wooden dress kept her up. The water carried her a long way, when she saw on the bank a gentleman, and began to cry, ""Who wants the fair Maria Wood?"" That gentleman who saw her on the water, and whom she addressed, called her and she came to the bank and saluted him. ""How is it that you are thus dressed in wood, and come floating on the water without drowning?"" She told him that she was a poor girl who had only that dress of wood, and that she wanted to go out to service. ""What can you do?"" ""I can do all that is needed in a house, and if you would only take me for a servant you would be satisfied."" He took her to his house, where his mother was, and told her all that had happened, saying, ""If you, dear mother, will take her as a servant, we can try her."" In short, she took her and was pleased with this woman dressed in wood. It happened that there were balls at that place which the best ladies and gentlemen attended. The gentleman who had the servant dressed in wood prepared to go to the ball, and after he had departed, the servant said to his mother, ""Do me this kindness, mistress: let me go to the ball too, for I have never seen any dancing."" ""What, you wish to go to the ball so badly dressed that they would drive you away as soon as they saw you!"" The servant was silent and when the mistress was in bed, dressed herself in one of her silk dresses and became the most beautiful woman that was ever seen. She went to the ball, and it seemed as if the sun had entered the room; all were dazzled. She sat down near her master, who asked her to dance, and would dance with no one but her. She pleased him so much that he fell in love with her. He asked her who she was and where she came from. She replied that she came from a distance, but told him nothing more. At a certain hour, without anyone perceiving it, she went out and disappeared. She returned home and put on her wooden dress again. In the morning the master returned from the ball, and said to his mother, ""Oh! if you had only seen what a beautiful lady there was at the ball! She appeared like the sun, she was so beautiful and well dressed. She sat down near me, and would not dance with anyone but me."" His mother then said, ""Did you not ask her who she was and where she came from?"" ""She would only tell me that she came from a distance; but I thought I should die; I wish to go again this evening."" The servant heard all this dialogue, but kept silent, pretending that the matter did not concern her. In the evening he prepared himself again for the ball, and the servant said to him, ""Master, yesterday evening I asked your mamma to let me, too, go to the ball, for I have never seen dancing, but she would not; will you have the kindness to let me go this evening?"" ""Be still, you ugly creature, the ball is no place for you!"" ""Do me this favor,"" she said, weeping, ""I will stand out of doors, or under a bench, or in a corner so no one shall see me; but let me go!"" He grew angry then, and took a stick and began to beat the poor servant. She wept and remained silent. After he had gone, she waited until his mother was in bed, and put on a dress finer than the first, and so rich as to astonish, and away to the ball! When she arrived all began to gaze at her, for they had never seen anything more beautiful. All the handsomest young men surrounded her and asked her to dance; but she would have nothing to do with anyone but her master. He again asked her who she was, and she said she would tell him later. They danced and danced, and all at once she disappeared. Her master ran here and there, asked one and another, but no one could tell him where she had gone. He returned home and told his mother all that had passed. She said to him, ""Do you know what you must do? Take this diamond ring, and when she dances with you give it to her; and if she takes it, it is a sign that she loves you."" She gave him the ring. The servant listened, saw everything, and was silent. In the evening the master prepared for the ball and the servant again asked him to take her, and again he beat her. He went to the ball, and after midnight, as before, the beautiful lady returned more beautiful than before, and as usual would dance only with her master. At the right moment he took out the diamond ring, and asked her if she would accept it. She took it and thanked him, and he was happy and satisfied. Afterward he asked her again who she was and where from. She said that she was of that country, and said no more. At the usual hour she stopped dancing and departed. He ran after her, but she went like the wind, and reached home without his finding out where she went. But he ran so in all directions, and was in such suffering, that when he reached home he was obliged to go to bed more dead than alive. Then he fell ill and grew worse every day, so that all said he would die. He did nothing but ask his mother and everyone if they knew anything of that lady, and that he would die if he did not see her. The servant heard everything; and one day, when he was very ill, what did she think of? She waited until her mistress's eye was turned, and dropped the diamond ring in the broth her master was to eat. No one saw her, and his mother took him the broth. He began to eat it, when he felt something hard, saw something shine, and took it out. You can imagine how he looked at it and recognized the diamond ring! They thought he would go mad. He asked his mother if that was the ring and she swore that it was, and all happy, she said that now he would see her again. Meanwhile the servant went to her room, took off her wooden dress, and put on one all of silk, so that she appeared a beauty, and went to the room of the sick man. His mother saw her and began to cry, ""Here she is; here she is!"" She went in and saluted him, smiling, and he was so beside himself that he became well at once. He asked her to tell him her story: who she was, where she came from, how she came, and how she knew that he was ill. She replied, ""I am the woman dressed in wood who was your servant. It is not true that I was a poor girl, but I had that dress to conceal myself in, for underneath it I was the same that I am now. I am a lady; and although you treated me so badly when I asked to go to the ball, I saw that you loved me, and now I have come to save you from death."" You can believe that they stayed to hear her story. They were married and have always been happy and still are.","Italy, Thomas Frederick Crane","Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1885), no. 10, pp. 48-52.","Maria Wood (Italy, Rachel Harriette Busk).",NA

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Maria Wood,"But this she said because the shoe was under a spell, and would fit no one whom he could marry. The king, however, caused the shoe to be tried on all manner of women; and when the answer always was that it would fit none of them, he grew quite bewildered and strange in his mind. After some years had passed, his young daughter, having grown up to girl's estate, came to him one day, saying, ""Oh, papa; only think! Mamma's shoe just fits me!"" ""Does it!"" replied the simple king; ""then I must marry you."" ""Oh, that cannot be, papa,"" said the girl, and ran away. But the simple king was so possessed with the idea that he must marry the woman whom his wife's shoe fitted, that he sent for her every day and said the same thing. But the queen had not said that he should marry the woman whom her shoe fitted, but that he should not marry any whom it did not fit. When the princess found that he persevered in his silly caprice, she said at last, ""Papa, if I am to do what you say, you must do some thing for me first."" ""Agreed, my child,"" replied the king; ""you have only to speak."" ""Then, before I marry,"" said the girl, ""I want a lot of things, but I will begin with one at a time. First, I want a dress of the color of a beautiful noontide sky, but all covered with stars like the sky at midnight, and furnished with a parure to suit it."" Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. ""Next,"" said the princess, ""I want a dress of the color of the sea, all covered with golden fishes, with a fitting parure."" Such a dress the king had made, and brought to her. ""Next,"" said the princess, ""I want a dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and with a parure to match."" Such a dress the king had made and brought to her. ""These are all very good,"" said the princess; ""but now you must send for the most cunning artificer in your whole kingdom, and let him make me a figure of an old woman just like life, fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it, just like a real woman."" Such a figure the king had made, and brought it to the princess. ""That is just the sort of figure I wanted,"" said she;"" and now I don't want anything more."" And the simple king went away quite happy. As soon as she was alone, however, the princess packed all the three dresses and many of her other dresses, and all her jewelry and a large sum of money, inside the figure of the old woman, and then she got into it and walked away. No one seeing an old woman walking out of the palace thought she had anything to do with the princess, and thus she got far away without anyone thinking of stopping her. On, on, on, she wandered till she came to the palace of a great king, and just at the time that the king's son was coming in from hunting. ""Have you a place in all this fine palace to take in a poor old body?"" whined the princess inside the figure of the old woman. ""No, no! get out of the way! How dare you come in the way of the prince!"" said the servants, and drove her away. But the prince took compassion on her, and called her to him. ""What's your name, good woman?"" said the prince. ""Maria Wood is my name, your Highness,"" replied the princess. ""And what can you do, since you ask for a place?"" ""Oh, I can do many things. First, I understand all about poultry, and then --"" ""That'll do,"" replied the prince; ""take her, and let her be the hen-wife, and let her have food and lodging, and all she wants."" So they gave her a little hut on the borders of the forest, and set her to tend the poultry. But the prince as he went out hunting often passed by her hut, and when she saw him pass she never failed to come out and salute him, and now and then he would stop his horse and spend a few moments in gossip with her. Before long it was Carnival time; and as the prince came by Maria Wood came out and wished him a ""good Carnival."" The prince stopped his horse and said, his young head full of the pleasure he expected, ""Tomorrow, you know, we have the first day of the feast."" ""To be sure I know it; and how I should like to be there; won't you take me?"" answered Maria Wood. ""You shameless old woman,"" replied the prince, ""to think of your wanting to go to a festino at your time of life!"" and he gave her a cut with his whip. The next day Maria put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky, covered with stars like the sky at midnight, with the parure made to wear with it, and came to the feast. Every lady made place before her dazzling appearance, and the prince alone dared to ask her to dance. With her he danced all the evening, and fairly fell in love with her, nor could he leave her side; and as they sat together, he took the ring off his own finger and put it on to her hand. She appeared equally satisfied with his attentions, and seemed to desire no other partner. Only when he tried to gather from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Whipblow, which set the prince wondering very much, as he had never heard of such a country. At the end of the ball, the prince sent his attendants to watch her that he might learn where she lived, but she disappeared so swiftly it was impossible for them to tell what had become of her. When the prince came by Maria Wood's hut next day, she did not fail to wish him again a ""good Carnival."" ""Tomorrow we have the second festino, you know,"" said the prince. ""Well I know it,"" replied Maria Wood; ""shouldn't I like to go! Won't you take me?"" ""You contemptible old woman to talk in that way!"" exclaimed the prince. ""You ought to know better!"" and he struck her with his boot. Next night Maria put on her dress of the color of the sea, covered all over with gold fishes, and the parure made to wear with it, and went to the feast. The prince recognized her at once, and claimed her for his partner all the evening, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he tried to learn from her whence she was, she would only say she came from the country of Bootkick. The prince could not remember ever to have heard of the Bootkick country, and thought she meant to laugh at him; however, he ordered his attendants to make more haste this night in following her; but what diligence so ever they used she was too swift for them. The next time the prince came by Maria Wood's hut, she did not fail to wish him again a ""good Carnival."" ""Tomorrow we have the last festino!"" exclaimed he, with a touch of sadness, for he remembered it was the last of the happy evenings that he could feel sure of seeing his fair unknown. ""Ah! you must take me. But, what'll you say if I come to it in spite of you?"" answered Maria Wood. ""You incorrigible old woman!"" exclaimed the prince; ""you provoke me so with your nonsense, I really cannot keep my hand off you;"" and he gave her a slap. The next night Maria Wood put on her dress of a dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and the parure made to wear with it. The prince constituted her his partner for the evening as before, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only when he wanted to learn from her whence she was, all she would say was that she came from Slapland. This night the prince told his servants to make more haste in following her, or he would discharge them all. But they answered, ""It is useless to attempt the thing, as no mortal can equal her in swiftness."" After this, the prince fell ill of his disappointment, because he saw no hope of hearing any more of the fair domino with whom he had spent three happy evenings, nor could any doctor find any remedy for his sickness. Then Maria Wood sent him word, saying, ""Though the prince's physicians cannot help him, yet let him but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed."" ""Nonsense! how can a cup of broth, or how can any medicament, help me!"" exclaimed the prince. ""There is no cure for my ailment."" Again Maria Wood sent the same message; but the prince said angrily, ""Tell the silly old thing to hold her tongue; she doesn't know what she's talking about."" But again, the third time, Maria Wood sent to him, saying, ""Let the prince but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed."" By this time the prince was so weary that he did not take the trouble to refuse. The servants finding him so depressed began to fear that he was sinking, and they called to Maria Wood to make her broth, because, though they had little faith in her promise, they knew not what else to try. So Maria Wood made ready the cup of broth she had promised, and they put it down beside the prince. Presently the whole palace was roused; the prince had started up in bed, and was shouting, ""Bring hither Maria Wood! Quick! Bring hither Maria Wood!"" So they ran and fetched Maria Wood, wondering what could have happened to bring about so great a change in the prince. But the truth was, that Maria had put into the cup of broth the ring the prince had put on her finger the first night of the feast, and when he began to take the broth he found the ring with the spoon. When he saw the ring, he knew at once that Maria Wood could tell where to find his fair partner. ""Wait a bit! There's plenty of time!"" said Maria, when the servant came to fetch her in all haste; and she waited to put on her dress of the color of the noontide sky. The prince was beside himself for joy when he saw her, and would have the betrothal celebrated that very day.",Italy,"Source: Rachel Harriette Busk Roman Legends: A Collection of the Fables and Folk-Lore of Rome (Boston: Estes and Lauriat, 1877), pp. 84-90.","All-Kinds-of-Fur (Greece, J.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Morag a Chota Bhain -- Margery White Coats,"The king saw them from a window, and wished to marry her, and she went for advice to her mother's brother. He advised her to promise to marry the king if he would bring her a gown of birds' down, and a gown of the colors of the sky, woven with silver; and when he got that, a gown of the colors of the stars, woven with gold, and glass shoes. When he had got them, she escaped with all her clothes, by the help of her uncle, on a filly, with a magic bridle, she on one side, and her chest of clothes on the other. She rode to a king's palace, hid the chest in a hill under a bush of rushes, turned the filly loose, and went to the palace with nothing on but a white petticoat and a shift. She took service with the cook, and grew dirty and ugly, and slept on a bench by the kitchen fire, and her work was to blow under the great caldron all day long. One day the king's son came home, and was to hold a feast; she went to the queen and asked leave to go, and was refused because she was so dirty. The queen had a basin of water in her hand, and threw it at her, and it broke. She went to the hill, took out the dress of down and silver, and shook her magic bridle; the filly came, and she mounted, and rode to the feast. The king's son took her by the hand, and took her up as high as any there, and set her on his own lap; and when the feast was over, there was no reel that he danced but he gave it to her. He asked her whence she came, and she said, ""From the kingdom of Broken Basins,"" and the prince said that he had never heard of that land, though he had travelled far. She escaped and returned to the cook, and all were talking about the beautiful lady. She asked about her, and was told not to talk about what she did not understand, ""a dirty little wretch like her."" Then the prince had another feast; and she asked leave again, and the queen refused, and threw a candlestick at her, and it broke, and she did as before. She put on another dress and went; the king's son had eight men on each side of the door to catch her. The same scene went on, and she said she came from the country of Candlesticks, and escaped, leaving a glass shoe. Then the king's son fell sick (of course), and would only marry the woman whom the shoe would fit; and all the ladies came and cut off their toes and heels, but in vain. Then he asked if there was none other. Then a small creature put his head in at the door and said, ""If thou didst but know, she whom thou seekest is under the cook."" Then he got the history of the basin and candlestick from his mother. The shoe was tried and fitted, and he was to marry Morag. All were in despair, and abused her; but she went out to her chest, shook the magic bridle, and arrayed herself, and came back on the filly, with a ""powney"" behind with the chest. Then all there that had despised her fell on their knees, and she was married to the prince. ""And I did not get a bit there at the wedding,"" said the girl. The girl and her chest on the same horse may be seen in the Highlands. The girl, in her white coats and short gown, may be seen blowing the fire in highland inns, the queen's likeness might be found; and the feast is a highland ball; the filly and the magic bridle are common in other stories; the incidents of the basin and candlestick have an equivalent in Norse; and I got them from a woman at the Sound of Barra afterwards, in another story. This shows what may be lost by dignified traveling. While the man was enjoying himself in the kitchen, the employer was smoking in solitary dignity, upstairs in his bedroom, writing a journal, and utterly unconscious that the game he pursued was so near.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,Rashen Coatie,"The queen being now wearied with trying all the arts that mischief could devise, to bring Rashen Coatie's beauty to a level with her daughter's; or to raise her daughter's beauty to that of Rashen Coatie's; thought she must have some hidden means of subsistence, as all the stratagems she tried were always attended with want of success. On consulting her henwife, who was a witch, how she should behave in this critical juncture; the witch said she would give her an eye in her neck, by which sight she would be able to discover many things, particularly how Rashen Coatie was fed and maintained without her perceiving it. Accordingly the queen went next day to the castle to discover Rashen Coatie's friends, and discovered how she was fed, owing to an omission of Rashen Coatie's. She found that it was the calf that fed her, which made her long to get it destroyed. The king though loath to deprive his daughter of her only companion, her favourite calf, he was obliged to comply with the queen's imperious demands, in order to suppress the wrangling and strife which were daily taking place among his domestics, particularly by his queen. Rashen Coatie having discovered the queen's intention, mourned over her ravenous appetite, with streaming eyes and bleached cheeks. The calf having the power of speech, requested her not to be alarmed at what was to take place, but to gather together all the bones into one mass, and place them beneath a particular stone, and in a short time they would revive and come to life again. This having been done as commanded, everything came to pass as predicted by the calf; and the malicious queen having partook of the entrails of the calf, lingered and died of a disease hitherto unknown in that part of the country. Her daughter now became of contempt, despised and hooted by everyone. Rashen Coatie's sun now began to shine in meridian splendour; she was gentle and mild, humble to everyone, which gained her the esteem and good will of both great and small. Her beauty having kept pace with her virtue, her father took such a liking to her, as to wish to marry her; but this being quite contrary to her principles of sound morality, she grew melancholy, every day more and more, and lingered out a weary existence, till having met with her calf, she asked it what was best to be done under such pressing difficulties. The calf advised her to ask from her father a gown and petticoat made of the rashes that grew on the bonny burn side, in which she was to be drest. This having been accomplished; she then requested of him to give her a dress composed of all the colours of the birds of the air. This also having been given her; she demanded a new suit of variegated colours, composed of all those appearances that float in the air, and in the earth beneath. Having obtained all these varieties; she had now no excuse but to comply with her father's wishes, which were to accompany him to the altar, where all things were ready for the marriage ceremony. Having thus far complied with his wishes, she went, but on arriving at the place appointed, she started back, exclaiming, that she had forgotten her marriage ring. Her father, to prevent her returning home, said he had one which would answer the purpose perfectly well; but she insisted on having her mother's ring, and must needs return for it, but promised to be back in a few minutes. Again, she had recourse to the advice of her calf, which was to dress herself in her rashen weed, and to leave her father's kingdom with all speed. This was accordingly done, and she wandered far till she came to a hunting lodge, kept by the prince of that country. Here she made free to enter, and go to the prince's bed to rest her wearied limbs, which had undergone much toil and fatigue in the course of a long and laborious travel. When the prince came to his lodge, he was surprised to find a sleeping beauty in his bed, as it was in a sequestered part of his kingdom, where few inhabitants were to be found. She soon made her escape from him, and went to his father's palace, where she asked a place as a menial servant, which was granted, and thereby put into the kitchen to assist the cook in turning the spits which groaned with the weight of the meat that was roasting for their majesties' dinner. Here she continued for some time, doing all the drudgery of the meanest servant. Christmas, however, came on, when great preparations were made for church. Rashen Coatie also wished to appear among the rest, but was denied permission by the master cook. But it so happened that, on the first yule day, when all were gone, and she left alone in the kitchen to attend the meat, she said to the spits, peats, and pots, to do their duty till she returned; which was accordingly done. The words of the charm which she made use of on this occasion were as follows: The term of her secrecy seemed to be now at end; for hurrying home on the last day, she dropped one of her shoes, which were so completely fitted to her feet, that it was supposed it would suit no one else. The prince, on having found the shoe, which was of pure gold, caused to be proclaimed throughout all the regions of his father's kingdom round about, that everyone should have free liberty to try on the shoe, and whomsoever the shoe fitted best, was to be his bride. Many trials were made, but all to no purpose, till the henwife's daughter caused her heels and toes to be pared; by which process she got it forced on her foot. Agreeably to the proclamation, it therefore became the prince to marry her, with which he was to comply, but with a heavy heart. On their way to the marriage seat, a small bird fluttered over their heads, crying as they went:",Scotland,"Source: Ancient Scottish Tales: An Unpublished Collection Made by Peter Buchan, with an introduction by John A.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Beautiful Princess,"The king had a daughter who was just as beautiful as his wife. He traveled far and wide to seek another wife, but found no one as beautiful as his first wife had been. Therefore he decided to marry his own daughter, but she did not want to marry him. She was not able to change his mind, so she told him to buy for her a louse-coat (a coat lined with louse pelts), a silver dress, a diamond ring, and golden shoes. The king had an old kinswoman. The evening before the wedding the princess asked her what she should do. The old woman advised her to pack her things and run away, so that night she left. The next morning the king looked for his girl, but could not find her. He asked everyone, ""Haven't you seen her? Haven't you seen my bride?"" But no one could give him any information. When the princess ran away she came to a river. She boarded a boat, but the ferryman did not want to transport her. He said, ""If you will not promise to give yourself to me, I will drown you here and now."" She refused him, and he threw her overboard, but she jumped to the water's edge. She continued onward, without knowing where she was going. Then she came to some cliffs, and said, ""Oh, dear God, if only there were a room here!"" Then the cliffs did indeed open into a room, and she went inside. Everything there was just what she had wished for. She soon went out, leaving her beautiful clothes in the room, and it turned back into a cliff, just as before. She went to an estate where she found a position as a Cinderella. Her brother was there as well. He too had left their father, and was employed in the estate as a secretary. He had a servant, and whenever he told his servant to bring him water or his boots, Cinderella ran and brought them to him. And every time she did this, he would throw them at her. She asked her mistress for permission to return home now and then. But instead of going home she went back to the cliffs, and whenever she approached them, they again opened up into a room, and then she would put on her beautiful clothes. Then every time a coach would drive up and take her to church. The secretary was also at church, and he saw the beautiful girl. Therefore he went to church the next Sunday, and the girl was there as well. Her mistress had told her that she had to return before the secretary did. However, one day she was late, and she did not have time to take off her beautiful clothes. Instead she put on her everyday clothes over the beautiful ones. The secretary told his servant to have her come and delouse him. She did not want to do this, and said, ""You have never needed me to do that before, and you don't need me to do it now."" But after the servant had called her a second and a third time, she had to go. While she was looking through his hair, he was examining her clothing, coming finally to the coat. Then he raised his head from her knees, ripped the scarf from her head, and immediately recognized her as his sister. Then they left the estate, and no one knows where they went.",Lithuania,"Source: August Schleicher, Litauische Märchen, Sprichworte, Rätsel und Lieder (Weimar: Hermann Böhlau, 1857), pp. 10-12.","Pigskin (Ukraine, Alexander Afanasyev).",NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Emperor's Daughter in the Pig Stall,"The emperor was astonished at this monstrous requirement, but in order to achieve his goal he depleted his treasury, and what was still needed he forcefully took from his subjects. Thus he collected enough wealth to have a diamond dress made than cost ten thousand times what the golden one had cost. The princess was startled when he brought it to her, and asked for one day to think things through. The emperor granted her this, and she discussed the situation with her nurse, who advised her to demand a dress that he certainly would not be able to have made: one made entirely of louse pelts, and trimmed with flea pelts. When the emperor heard the princess's latest wish he became angry, but said nothing. Instead he issued the order to have such a dress made. It took an entire year to collect all the pelts and hides for this dress, and yet another year before they were all sewn together. Then emperor brought the dress to his daughter, and this time the princess -- following the old woman's advice -- let the marriage between herself and her father take place. That evening, after entering the bridal chamber with him, she asked for permission to step outside for a moment. He refused, for he did not trust her and thought that she wanted to escape from him. She gave him a piece of string, tying one end around her own left hand, and told him that if she did not come back in time, he would only have to pull her in. So the hateful father finally agreed, and the princess slipped out the door, where her nurse was standing ready with an old bill goat, and they quickly tied the string around its horns. Then the princess put on all her dresses -- first the one of diamonds, over that the one of gold, then the silver one, and over them all the disgusting one that the emperor had just had made. Then she fled. Meanwhile the emperor waited impatiently, finally pulling gently on the string. Outside the billy goat pulled back. The emperor finally pulled hard, but the billy goat would not be outdone in such a tug-of-war. Finally the emperor, filled with rage, jumped up and went to the door. To his astonishment, instead of his charming daughter he found there a shaggy black billy goat, which rudely attacked him with its horns. The emperor retreated into the bridal chamber, and called for his people, who -- led by the nurse -- came to him. The emperor vented his anger with a storm of curse words. He told of his adventure and ordered that the billy goat be taken away. The nurse began to shriek, ""See here, you tyrannical father, see what you have caused? God has punished you because of your wicked marriage. He has transformed your daughter into this terrible horned monster!"" With these and many other words, the cunning nurse convinced the deceived ruler that the just anger of God had caused this miracle. Filled with shame, he said nothing more about the matter. Meanwhile the princess fled into a great forest, where -- since the season was right -- she lived from berries and nuts that she found in the bushes. Now it happened that the prince of the kingdom to which these woods belonged was hunting there. Evening was approaching when the prince, accompanied by just one servant, pursued a wild boar into a deep thicket. To his great astonishment he saw there an unusual forest creature. Not knowing what to make of it, he aimed an arrow at it. When he saw that it was not moving, he climbed the tree and captured the unknown animal alive. With great clamor the forest creature was led through the city to the palace. There, because of its disgusting fur, it was turned over to the swineherd, who locked it in his worst pig stall, above which was a chicken coop. Thus the unknown forest creature's fur became even filthier. From the scraps that they brought it to eat, it would take only berries and nuts from the forest. Soon afterward there was a glorious festival in the city. The son of a well-known gentleman was getting married. All the beautiful and important people were gathered there: maidens, ladies, and gentlemen, whatever their names. When evening came the princess, pulled off her disgusting garb, revealing the silver dress beneath it, left the pig stall, and went to the wedding. The prince, who was also there, saw her and danced with her; and because he found her so extraordinarily beautiful he gave her a valuable ring, after having spoken with her, and in the end having danced only with her. Morning approached, and the unknown beauty disappeared from the hall without anyone observing where she went. The princess had put her stall garb back on and was peacefully asleep in the pig stall. On the second evening she again appeared at the wedding, this time in her golden dress. The prince, who had been looking for her, was very happy to see her, and did not leave her side, for he wanted to know who this exceptionally wealthy gleaming beauty was. However, although he watched her carefully, trying to prevent her from escaping again, she took advantage of an opportune moment and slipped away. Before anyone noticed her absence she was again hidden beneath her filthy garb in the pig stall. On the third evening the mysterious maiden once again appeared at the wedding. Her glorious diamond dress astonished everyone. The prince thought that a maiden wearing such an incalculably costly dress must be of high nobility, but he was a thousand times more impressed by her personal beauty. He happily conversed with her alone, but to his dismay she would not tell him who she was or where she came from. As morning approached she again slipped away from the hall so cunningly that neither the prince nor anyone else noticed her leave. The wedding was now over, and the prince had no hope of seeing his mysterious beloved again. This made him seriously ill. The princess sat in her pig stall, but not as calmly as earlier, for she too had fallen in love. A few days passed, and the prince, almost dying of longing, did not leave his bed. Then one of his friends came to visit him, and he ordered breakfast for the prince. The strange forest creature appeared to be quiet and well-behaved, so they let it run about freely. On this morning it had gone to the kitchen to warm itself by the fire, for it was cold in the stall. Reluctantly the kitchen maid had allowed this, and the forest creature was cowering next to the stove. When milk was placed on the fire, the forest creature asked who it was for. Learning that it was for the prince, she secretly pulled from her finger the ring that the prince had given her at the wedding, and dropped it into the pot. After warming herself, she crept back to the pig stall, put on her diamond dress, and was once again the most beautiful princess. Meanwhile the prince was eating breakfast with his friend, and he was shocked almost to death to discover at the bottom of the milk pot the ring that he had given to his beloved mysterious stranger. He immediately summoned the kitchen maid who had prepared his breakfast, but she swore that she did not know how the ring came to be in the pot. The prince investigated further: Who else had been in the kitchen. Finally the girl admitted, after resisting for a long time, that the ugly forest creature had been there warming itself by the fire. The prince and his friend immediately went to the stall where the disgusting forest creature was kept. He opened the door and looked inside, then took three steps back in joyful surprise. There sat his beautiful and beloved mysterious stranger, dressed in her glorious gown. She stepped out and said, ""I am the one, my prince!"" Answering his questions as to how she had come to this horrible place, she told him her story, which astonished everyone. Then the prince tenderly took his beloved princess into his arms. Soon thereafter, to the pleasure of the entire court, a magnificent wedding brought this story to a happing end.",Romania,"Source: Arthur and Albert Schott, ""Die Kaiserstochter im Schweinstall,"" Walachische Maehrchen (Stuttgart: J.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Horse's Skin,"Many years had elapsed since his queen died, and he began to feel lonely without a partner in life, and one who could occupy the vacant seat beside him on the throne, so he resolved to visit a certain court where a princess lived, whom he admired, and to make an offer of marriage to her. The princess, who was selfish and only cared for her own comfort, asked the king before accepting his offer, what he intended to do with his daughters, as she did not want them about her in the palace. ""If my daughters,"" replied the king, ""are a hindrance to our union, I can soon dispose of them, and send them where you will never see them or hear of them."" On his return to the palace he said to his daughters, ""Get ready at once to go with me to the Tower of Moncorvo, where I will show you what you have never seen before in your life."" The daughters, full of confidence in their father, and not suspecting any treachery, readily prepared to accompany him, and after travelling many leagues arrived at the celebrated tower. When the king had them safe in the castle, he said to his daughters, ""Remain here, whilst I pay a short visit to a friend and worthy subject, who lives in this neighbourhood. On my return I will take you back to the palace."" The wicked king, who only made up this excuse to blind his daughters to his real intentions, fastened the great gates of the tower as he went out, so that his daughters could not possibly escape. He supplied them with food every day until his marriage day, but after that he never concerned himself about them any more, but left them to their fate. Hours passed, and days came and went, and still no succour arrived, and they began to be in a dreadful state, without a morsel of food or water to refresh them. And so it happened that one day, when they had given up all hopes of being relieved, and were nearly dead from starvation, the eldest of the princesses said to her sisters, ""Why should we all starve? The best thing you two can do is to kill me and feed upon me as long as I afford you sustenance."" She had hardly said these words when she dropped down dead from want. A few days after this sad event the surviving princesses were again short of food, and nothing was left them but to die. Then the second sister, remembering what the first one had so generously done, followed her example, and suggested that her younger sister should kill her for food; and when she had finished uttering the last words of her advice she also dropped down and died. The poor young girl, now left alone in the large dreary castle, felt very disconsolate, and rent the air with her lamentations. But after a while, being of a courageous mind, she thought to herself that weeping was no remedy for her woes, and that she must devise some means of escape from her prison before she became faint again with want. She now set about examining the various rooms of which the castle was composed, and when she reached the top of the watchtower she looked out and saw a ship sailing on the ocean. Overjoyed at the sight, she at once began to make signals, waving her handkerchief in hopes of attracting the notice of someone in the vessel. The sailors were not slow to perceive the signal, and calling up their captain, drew his attention to it. The captain, who was a humane and chivalrous man, directed the ship towards the spot, and effected an entrance by scaling the wall of the fortress. On reaching the watchtower, the captain and the sailors that accompanied him were shocked to see a maiden of such rank and beauty treated worse than a common criminal. They took her up tenderly and lowered her into the vessel, and sailing to a port of safety they landed her, together with a chest in which she had packed some of her own and her sisters' dresses. As she stood on the seashore she glanced around her, and felt the wretchedness of her situation, without a home or friends to whom to apply for shelter. She had not been long immersed in these melancholy thoughts when she perceived an old woman coming towards her, whom she felt sure was a good benevolent person. She approached her and addressed her thus: ""My good woman, do you know of anyone that would give me shelter and a meal for today? I am willing to work for it."" ""If you want employment come and draw water from the well, and help me to carry it to the house I work for; there you will get a meal, and in the evening you can take up your quarters in my little cottage."" ""Tell me first,"" replied the princess, ""what house it is you work for?"" ""Oh! I draw water for our king's palace."" The young maiden consented to help the old woman, but as she could not work in her fine clothes, she had a garment made for her of the skin of a horse, and thus disguised she did not think that anyone would take her for a princess. Every day she went to the well and helped the old woman to draw water and carry the pitchers to the palace; and from the odd garments she wore everyone in the palace called her ""Horse-Skin."" One day as she entered the palace yard, carrying a pitcher of water poised on her head in a light and graceful manner, which showed off her elegant figure, a page, who had often noticed her beauty, and secretly suspected that the girl was not born to do this drudgery, and that there was some mystery about her, accosted her very respectfully, and said: ""Do you know that our good king is going to give balls for three nights running, so that he may choose himself a wife from among the dancers? The prettiest girl is to carry off the prize, and the king, as a mark of his choice, is to give her a ring -- and what a ring that will be! I wish you could manage to go."" ""What have I to do with balls, a poor girl like me? It is all very well for princesses and fine people. I shall turn in at my old woman's tonight, as usual."" When the princess had done her work she went home, and that evening being the first night of the balls at the palace, she dressed herself in her eldest sister's clothes, and went to the ball. When she entered the ballrooms, which were brilliantly lighted up, all eyes were turned upon her, and before the end of the dance she was pronounced by all present as most beautiful. The king was not long in discovering her charms, and caused great jealousy among the ladies by asking her again and again to dance with him, and loading her with delicate and polite attentions. But she slipped out of the palace early, before the king had time to notice her absence. The next day Horse-Skin was again toiling and carrying water to the palace as if nothing had happened. As she entered the palace yard the page again accosted her, and repeated what he had said the day before. ""Have I not told you, man, that all this does not concern me? What is it to me whether the king gives a ball or not? I shall go home to my old lady and spend the evening resting after my hard work."" The princess went to the second ball in her second sister's dress, which set off her beauty even more than the first had done. A number of partners were anxious to dance with her, but they had little chance, for the king mostly danced with her. He treated the princess with the profoundest respect as he gazed on her loveliness, and dared not ask her who she was. But she with her usual discretion left the ballroom at a moment when the king's attention was engaged by other guests; and next morning, as usual, Horse-Skin was at her duties in the palace. The page once again came up to her and said in a beseeching tone: ""Do, Horse-Skin, go to the last ball, which is to take place in the palace tonight, for the king is to give the ring tonight to the fairest lady and the one he admires most! You should have seen what jealousy there was among the ladies that attended the ball last night; they say it is useless for them to go to the ball again, as the king would not so much as look at them, or speak a word to them. All his interest was centred on a lovely and mysterious maiden who attended the last two dances, and who, I assure you, has nearly turned the king's brain with love; you should see her smile, her coral lips, her star-like eyes -- the very image of yours, I declare! -- and the fascinating manner in which she danced -- there -- I only wish I was a prince to marry her!"" The princess's only reply to all this, was: ""Leave me alone; what matters it to me whom the king admires? Tonight I shall be at my old woman's, as usual."" At the last ball the princess wore her own robes, the colour, stuff, and make of which harmonised with her beauty still more than did her sister's garments; and as she mingled among the invited in the state apartments that night, she outshone all the other ladies -- princesses, marchionesses, duchesses, and squires' daughters -- like a brilliant gem of the first water. The king, fairly captivated, danced with her alone, and towards the end of the evening gave her the ring, as the sign of his having chosen her to be his spouse and queen. And though he had set several of his court courtiers to watch and see which way she took when she left the palace, the princess eluded their vigilance, and departed without being noticed even by the sentinels at the palace gate. Next day the king was sorely puzzled and grieved when, on making enquiries, he found that no one in the palace could give him the slightest information about the lady to whom he had given the ring, in token of his admiration and choice. He ordered a search through all the country round, to find out, if possible, who the maiden was; but all was of no avail, for the damsel could not be discovered high or low. At this the king, from grief and disappointment, sickened, and lay in a stupor for days together, until the physicians began to fear he would not live much longer. One day Horse-Skin met his majesty's nurse, and asked her how the king was. The nurse said the king was so ill that he was not expected to live through the day, all through the violent passion his majesty had conceived for the damsel to whom he had given the ring, and of whom no traces could be found. ""And,"" said she, ""unless the cruel girl makes herself known to his majesty soon, we shall lose our beloved king."" The nurse was at the time carrying some broth to give to the king; and Horse-Skin took this opportunity to drop the ring into the basin, without the nurse perceiving her. Great was the king's surprise when he discovered the ring; and the nurse being asked who had put that ring in his broth, replied that she did not know, and that the only person that had come near her, when carrying the basin, was poor Horse-Skin. The king then sent for Horse-Skin, and bade her tell him who had given her the ring which she had dropped into the basin. ""If your majesty will allow me to leave your presence for a few minutes, I will tell you, on my return, who gave the ring to me."" She had not been absent long when she returned to the king dressed in her own rich garments, and adorned as she had appeared at the last ball in the palace. She stood before the king, and said, ""Does your majesty know me now?"" ""Of course I do, you are the same sweet damsel to whom I gave the ring."" ""Very well,"" said the princess, ""I am she who dropped it in the broth, and I am your humble servant, Horse-Skin."" ""Explain yourself, you are still a mystery to me."" Thereupon the princess related the history of her life, which she did amid tears and sobs, as it brought back to her mind all she had suffered since her cruel father had deserted her and her sisters. The king from being sad, was now delighted to have found his lost love, and soon recovered from his illness, and was once more full of health. The king then led her to a magnificently furnished chamber where she was to remain until his marriage with her, as he would not let her return to the old woman's cottage. The happy pair were married amid great rejoicings, and the king and his beautiful bride were heartily welcomed by his subjects, who had mourned his absence from state affairs. They reigned happily for many long years.",Portugal,"Source: Francisco Adolpho Coelho, Tales of Old Lusitania from the Folk-Lore of Portugal, translated by Henriqueta Monteiro (London: Swan, Sonnenschein, and Company, 1888), pp. 51-60.","The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter (Scotland, J.

At the end of a day and year he returned with the gown. ""Say to him now,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him till he brings thee a golden shoe, and a silver shoe."" He got her a golden shoe and a silver shoe. ""Say to him now,"" said her muime, ""that thou wilt not marry him unless he brings thee a kist that will lock without and within, and for which it is all the same to be on sea or on land."" When she got the kist, she folded the best of her mother's clothes, and of her own clothes in it. Then she went herself into the kist, and she asked her father to put it out on the sea to try how it would swim. Her father put it out; when it was put out, it was going, and going, till it went out of sight. It went on shore on the other side; and a herd came where it was, intending to break it, in hopes that there were findings in the chest. When he was going to break it she called out, ""Do not so, but say to thy father to come here, and he will get that which will better him for life."" His father came, and he took her with him to his own house. It was with a king that he was herd, and the king's house was near him. ""If I could get,"" said she, ""leave to go to service to this great house yonder."" ""They want none,"" said the herd, ""unless they want one under the hand of the cook."" The herd went to speak for her, and she went as a servant maid under the hand of the cook. When the rest were going to the sermon; and when they asked her if she was going to it, she said, ""that she was not; that she had a little bread to bake, and that she could not go to it."" When they went away, she took herself to the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the down of the swan. She went to the sermon, and she sat opposite the king's son. The king's son took love for her. She went a while before the sermon skailed, she reached the herd's house, she changed her clothes, and she was in before them. When the rest came home, it was talking about the gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were. The next Sunday they said to her, ""Was she going to the sermon?"" and she said, ""that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."" When they went away, she reached the herd's house, and she put on a gown of the moorland canach; and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat opposite to him. She came out before them, and she changed, and she was at the house before them; and when the rest came home, it was talking about the great gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were. The third Sunday, they said to her, ""Was she going to the sermon?"" and she said, ""that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."" When they went away, she reached the herd's house. She put on the gown that would stand on the ground with gold and silver, and the golden shoe and the silver shoe, and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat where he was. A watch was set on the doors this Sunday. She arose, she saw a cranny, and she jumped out at the cranny; but they kept hold of one of the shoes. The king's son said, ""Whomsoever that shoe would fit, she it was that he would marry."" Many were trying the shoe on, and taking off their toes and heels to try if it would fit them; but there were none whom the shoe would fit. There was a little bird in the top of a tree, always saying as everyone was trying on the shoe, ""Beeg beeg ha nan doot a heeg ach don tjay veeg a ha fo laiv a hawchkare."" -- Wee wee, it comes not on thee; but on the wee one under the hand of the cook. When he could get none whom the shoe would fit, the king's son lay down, and his mother went to the kitchen to talk over the matter. ""Won't you let me see the shoe?"" said she. ""I will not do it any harm at all events."" ""Thou! thou ugly dirty thing, that it should fit thee."" She went down, and she told this to her son. ""Is it not known,"" said he, ""that it won't fit her at all events? And can't you give it her to please her?"" As soon as the shoe went on the floor, the shoe jumped on her foot. ""What will you give me,"" said she, "" to let you see the other one?"" She reached the herd's house, and she put on the shoes, and the dress that would stand on the floor with gold and silver. When she returned, there was but to send word for a minister, and she herself and the king's son married.",Scotland,"Source: J. F.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Princess and the Golden Cow,"She had made (or got her father to give her) a beautiful golden cow as large as a real one. She made arrangements in some manner (details forgotten) to have the golden cow conveyed under pretence of its being a parting gift or token of remembrance to the prince. She got inside it, and went in the cow a long journey by sea. There was a signal prearranged (details forgotten) of three knocks on the cow to show when she could come out safely. But when she had gone a long way the cow was landed (I think the captain of the ship was in the secret, and was to see to her reaching the prince), but people came to see the cow, for it was very curious, amongst them three gentlemen who wanted to be able to say they had touched it, and one poked it with his umbrella (sic), and said, ""I've touched the golden cow,"" and the next poked it with his umbrella, and said, ""I've touched the golden cow,"" and the third poked it with his umbrella, and said, ""I've touched the golden cow."" With that the princess opened the door and came out, for she thought those three knocks were the signal. Then the prince turned up, after some adventures that I have forgotten, and all ended happily.",England,"Source: Isabella Barclay, ""The Princess and the Golden Cow,"" Folklore, vol. 1, no. 4 (December 1890), Supplement, p. 149.","Barclay's source: ""The following variant ... was told to myself and sisters when wer were children by a servant from the Lizard district of Cornwall.""",NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Princess in the Cat-Skins,"""I took you too sudden,"" said he. ""Sleep on it, and you can give me an answer tomorrow."" She was in great trouble all the rest of the day, and when the evening came she went out into the paddock, where a beautiful filly she used to ride was grazing. ""Oh my poor beast! "" said she, ""I'm sure if you knew my trouble you'd pity me."" ""I do know your trouble, and I pity you, and I'll help you too,"" says the filly. ""I'm the fairy that watched over you from the time you were born, and I am here near you since your mother married the second time. Your stepfather is an enchanter, but he'll find me too strong for him. Don't seem shocked when he'll ask your consent tomorrow, but say you must have first a dress of silk and silver thread that will fit into a walnut shell. He'll promise, and will be able to get it made too, but I'll bother his spinner and his weaver long enough before he'll get it wove, and his seamstress after that, before it's sewed."" The princess done as she was bid, and the enchanter was in great joy; but he was kept in great trouble and anger for a full half year before the dress was ready to go on the princess. At last it was fitted, and he asked her was she ready to be his wife. ""I'll tell you tomorrow,"" said she. So she went to consult her filly in the paddock. Well, the next day he put the question to her again, and she said that she couldn't think of marrying anyone till she had another dress of silk and gold thread that would fit in a walnut shell. ""I wish you had mentioned itself and the silver dress together. Both could have been done at the same time. No matter. I'll get it done."" Whatever trouble the spinner and the weaver and the seamstress had with the other dress, they had twice it with this; but at last it was tried on, and fitted like a glove. ""Well now,"" says Fear Dhorrach, ""I hope you're satisfied, and won't put off the wedding again."" ""Oh, you must forgive me,"" said she, ""for my vanity."" She was talking to the filly the evening before. ""I can't do without a dress of silk thread as thick as it can be with diamonds and pearls no larger than the head of a minnikin pin. Three is a lucky number, you know."" ""Well, I wish you had mentioned this at first, and the three could be making together. Now this is the very last thing you'll ask, I expect."" ""Oh, I'll never ask another, you may depend, till I'm married."" She didn't say till we're married. The dress came home at last. Well, the same evening she found on her bed another made from bottom to top of cat-skins, and this she put on. She put her three walnut shells in her pocket, and then stole out to the stable, where she found her filly with a bridle in her mouth, and the nicest side-saddle ever you saw on her back. Away they went, and when the light first appeared in the sky they were a hundred miles away. They stopped at the edge of a wood, and the princess was very glad to rest herself on a bunch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. She wasn't a minute there when she fell asleep; and soundly she did sleep, till she was woke up by the blowing of bugles and the yelping of beagles. She jumped up in a fright. There was no filly near her, but half a hundred spotted hounds were within forty perches of her, yelling out of them like vengeance. I needn't tell you she was frightened. She had hardly power to put one foot past the other, and she'd be soon tore into giblets by the dogs on account of her dress, but a fine young hunter leaped over their heads, and they all fell back when he shook his whip and shouted at them. So he came to the princess, and there she was as wild looking as you please, with her cat-skins hanging round her, and her face and hands and arms as brown as a berry, from a wash she put on herself before she left home. Well that didn't hinder her features from being handsome, and the prince was astonished at her beauty and her color and her dress, when he found she was a stranger, and alone in the world. He got off his horse, and walked side by side with her to his palace, for he was the young king of that country. He sent for his housekeeper when he came to the hall door, and bid her employ the young girl about whatever she was fit for, and then set off to follow the hounds again. Well, there was great tittering in the servants' hall among the maids at her color and her dress, and the ganders of footmen would like to be joking with her, but she made no freedom with one or the other, and when the butler thought to give her a kiss, she gave him a light slap on the jaw that wouldn't kill a fly, but he felt as if a toothache was at him for eight and forty hours. By my word, the other buckeens did not give her an excuse to raise her hand to them. Well, she was so silent and kept herself to herself so much, that she was no favorite, and they gave her nothing better to do than help the scullery maid, and at night she had to put up with a little box of a place under the stairs for a bedroom. The next day, when the prince returned from hunting, he sent word to the housekeeper by the whipper-in to let the new servant bring him up a basin and towel till he'd wash before dinner. ""Oh, ho!"" says the cook, ""there's an honor for Cat-Skin. I'm here for forty years and never was asked to do such a thing; how grand we are! purshuin to all impedent people!"" The princess didn't mind their jibes and their jeers. She took up the things, and the prince delayed her ever so long with remarks and questions, striving to get out of her what rank of life she was born in. As little as she said he guessed her to be a lady. I suppose it is as hard for a lady or gentleman to pass for a vulgarian, as for one of us to act like one of the quality. Well to be sure! all the cold and scornful noses that were in the big kitchen before her; and it was, ""Cat-Skin, will you hand me this? Cat-Skin, will you grease my shoes? Cat-Skin, will you draw a jug of beer for me?"" And she done everything she was asked without a word or a sour look. Next night the prince was at a ball about three miles away, and the princess got leave from the housekeeper to go early to bed. Well, she couldn't get herself to lie down. She was in a fever like; she threw off her outside dress, and she stepped out into the lawn to get a little fresh air. There what did she behold but her dear filly under a tree. She ran over, and threw her arms round her neck, and kissed her face, and began to cry. ""No time for crying!"" says the filly. ""Take out the first walnut shell you got."" She did so, and opened it. ""Hold what's inside over your head,"" said the other, and in a moment the silk and silver dress wrapped her round as if a dozen manty-makers were after spending an hour about it. ""Get on that stump,"" says the filly, ""and jump into the side-saddle."" She did so, and in a few minutes they were at the hall door of the castle where the ball was. There she sprung from her saddle, and walked into the hall. Lights were in the hall and everywhere, and nothing could equal the glitter of the princess's robes and the accoutrements of her steed. It was like the curling of a stream in the sun. You may believe that the quality were taken by surprise, when the princess walked in among them as if they were the lords and ladies in her father's court. The young king came forward as he saw the rest were a little cowed, and bade her good evening and welcome; and they talked whatever way kings and queens and princesses do, and he made her sit on his own seat of honor, and took a stool or a chair near her, and if he wasn't delighted and surprised, her features were so like the scullery maid's, leave it till again. They had a fine supper and a dance, and the prince and she danced, and every minute his love for her was increasing, but at last she said she should go. Every one was sorry, and the prince more than anyone, and he came with her to the hall, and asked might he see her safe home. But she showed him her filly and excused herself. Said he, ""I'll have my brown horse brought, and myself and my servants will attend you."" ""Hand me up on my filly,"" says she, "" first of all,"" and, be the laws, I don't know how princes put princesses on horseback. Maybe one of the servants stoops his back, and the prince goes on one knee, and she steps first on his knee and then on the servant's back, and then sits in the saddle. Anyhow she was safe up, and she took the prince's hand, and bid him good night, and the filly and herself were away like a flash of lightning in the dark night. Well, everything appeared dismal enough when he went back to where a hundred tongues were going hard and fast about the lady in the dazzling dress. Next morning he bid his footman ask the girl in the cat-skin to bring him hot water and a towel for him, to shave. She came in as modest and backward as you please; but whenever the prince got a peep at her face, there were the beautiful eyes and nose and mouth of the lady in the glittering dress, but all as brown as a bit of bogwood. He thought to get a little talk out of her, but dickens a word would come out of her mouth but yes or no. And when he asked her was she of high birth, she turned off the discourse and wouldn't say one thing or the other; and when he asked would she like to put on nice clothes and be about his mother, she refused just as if he asked her to drown herself. So he found he could make nothing of her, and let her go down stairs. There was another great ball in a week's time, and the very same thing took place again. There was the princess, and the dress she had on was of silk and gold thread, and the darlintest little gold crown in the world over her purty curling hair. If the prince was in love before, he was up to his eyes in it this time; but while they were going on with the nicest sweet talk, says she, ""I'm afraid, prince, that you are in the habit of talking lovingly to every girl you meet."" Well, he was very eager to prove he was not. ""Then,"" said she, ""a little bird belied you as I was coming through the wood. He said that you weren't above talking soft even to a young servant girl with her skin as brown as a berry, and her dress no better than cat-skin.'' ""I declare to you, princess,"" said he, ""there is such a girl at home, and if her skin was as white as yours, and her dress the same, no eye could see a bit of differ between you."" ""Oh, thankee, prince!"" says she, ""for the compliment; it's time for me to be going."" Well, he thought to mollify her, but she curled her upper lip and cocked her nose, and wasn't long till she left, the way she did before. While she was getting on her filly, he almost went down on his knees to her to make it up. So at last she smiled, and said, ""If I can make up my mind to forgive you, I'll come to the next ball without invitation."" So she was away, and when they came under the tree in the lawn she took the upper hem of her dress in her fingers and it came off like a glove, and she made her way in at the hack door, and into her crib at the stair-foot. The prince slept little that night, and in the morning he sent his footman to ask the girl in the cat-skins to bring up a needle and thread to sew a button on his shirt sleeve. He watched her fingers, and saw they were small and of a lovely shape; and when one of them touched his wrist, it felt as soft and delicate as silk. All he could say got nothing out of her only, ""It wasn't a nice thing for a prince to speak in that way to a girl of low degree, and he boasting of it after to princesses and great ladies."" Well, how he did begin to deny anything so ungenteel, but the button was sewed, and she skipped away downstairs. The third night came, and she shook the dress of silk and pearls and diamonds over her, and the nicest crown of the same on her head. As grand and beautiful as she was before, she was twice as grand now; and the lords and ladies hardly dared to speak above their breaths, and the prince thought he was in heaven. He asked her at last would she be his queen, and not keep him in misery any longer, and she said she would, if she was sure he wouldn't ask Miss Cat-Skin the same question next day. Oh, how he spoke, and how he promised! He asked leave to see her safe home, but she wouldn't agree. ""But don't be downcast,"" said she. ""You will see me again sooner than you think; and if you know me when you meet me next, we'll part no more."" Just as she was sitting in her saddle, and the prince was holding her hand, he slipped a dawny limber ring of gold on one finger. It was so small and so nice to the touch he thought she wouldn't feel it. ""And now, my princess,"" says he to himself, ""I think I'll know you when I meet you."" Next morning he sent again for the scullery girl, and she came and made a curtchy. ""What does your majesty want me to do?"" said she. ""Only to advise me which of these two suits of clothes would look best on me; I'm going to be married."" ""Ah, how could the likes of me be able to advise you? Is the rich dressed lady, that I heard the footmen talking about, to be your queen?"" ""Yourself is as likely to be my wife as that young lady."" ""Then who is it?"" ""Yourself, I tell you."" "" Myself! How can your majesty joke that way on a poor girl? They say you're promised to the lady of the three rich dresses."" ""I'm promised to no one but yourself. I asked you twice already to be my queen; I ask you now the third time."" ""Yes, and maybe after all, you'll marry the lady of the dresses."" ""You promised you'd have me if I knew you the next time we'd meet. This is the next time. If I don't know you, I know my ring on your fourth finger."" She looked, and there it was sure enough. Maybe she didn't blush. ""Will your majesty step into the next room for a minute,"" said she, ""and leave me by myself?"" He did so, and when she opened the door for him again, there she was with the brown stain off her face and hands, and her dazzling dress of silk and jewels on her. Wasn't he the happy prince, and she the happy princess? And weren't the noisy servants lewd of themselves when they saw poor Cat-Skin in her royal dress saying the words before the priest? They didn't put off their marriage, and there was the fairy now in the appearance of a beautiful woman; and if I was to tell you about the happy life they led, I'd only be tiring you.",Ireland,"Source: Patrick Kennedy, The Fireside Stories of Ireland (Dublin: M'Glashan and Gill, 1870), pp. 81-87).","The Beautiful Princess (Lithuania, August Schleicher).",NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Princess Who Would Not Marry Her Father,"She then ran to the king her father, and said, ""Sire, do you know that a ring which I found on the table fits me as though it had been made expressly for me! . . ."" The king, on hearing this, replied, ""Oh! my daughter, you will have to marry me, because your mother, before she died, expressed a wish that I should marry whoever this ring would fit."" The princess, greatly distressed, shut herself up in a room which had the window looking into the garden, and gave vent to her grief. Soon, however, a little old woman appeared to her, and asked her, ""Why do you weep, royal lady?"" To which the princess replied, ""Well, what else can I do? My father says that I must marry him."" The little old woman then said to her, "" Listen to me, royal lady, go and tell your father that you will only marry him on condition that he buys you a dress of the color of the stars in the heavens."" And after saying this she departed. The princess then went up to the king, who asked her, ""Well, my daughter, are we to be married?"" To which she replied, ""Well, father, I shall marry you when you bring me a dress of the color of the stars in the heavens."" The father, on hearing this, went out and bought her the dress, and gave it to her readymade. The princess again went to her room to cry. The little old woman again appeared to her, and asked her, ""What ails you, royal lady?"" She replied, ""What can ail me! My father has bought me the dress I asked him for, and he wishes to marry me."" The old lady rejoined, ""Never mind, you must now ask him to bring you a dress of the color of the flowers that grow in the fields."" The princess again went to her father and told him that she could only marry him on condition of his bringing her a robe of the color of wild flowers. The king bought the dress and gave it to her made up, and quite ready to be put on. The princess, again in trouble, retired to her chamber to weep. The old lady again appeared and demanded, ""What ails you, royal lady? "" To which the princess replied, ""What can ail me, indeed! My father has bought me the second robe, and is determined to marry me."" The good old lady rejoined, ""Ask your father now for a robe of various colors."" The princess did so, and asked for a robe of various colors, and the king bought her the dress and brought it to her ready to be put on. The princess returned to her chamber to weep over her new trouble, but the little old woman came to her and asked her what troubled her. The princess replied that the king had bought her the third robe she required of him, and was now determined that the marriage should take place. ""And now what shall I do to prevent it? "" inquired the princess. The little old woman replied, ""Royal lady, you must now send for a carpenter and order him to make you a dress of wood; get inside it and go to the palace of the king who lives yonder, who requires a servant to tend the ducks."" The princess did as she was told, had a dress made of wood, put all her jewels, and everything else she would require, inside, and getting inside it herself; and one fine day she ran away. She walked on and on until she arrived at the said palace. She knocked at the door, and told the servants to ask his majesty the king if he required a maid to mind the ducks. He replied that he did ; and he asked her what her name was, and she rejoined that her name was Maria do Pau; and after this the king sent her to tend the ducks, which were in a field next to the palace gardens. The moment the princess reached it she took off everything she had on, and the wooden dress also; she washed herself, as she was travel-stained, and then put on the richest robe she had, which was the one the color of the stars. The king was taking a walk in the garden, and noticed a lovely maiden who was in the field driving the ducks, and heard her repeat When she had finished saying this she killed one of the ducks; then took off her robes, and again got into her wooden dress. At night she went indoors, saying, ""Oh! king, I have killed one of the ducks."" The king asked her, ""Maria do Pau, who was that beautiful maiden so splendidly robed that minded the ducks?"" To this she said, ""Indeed there was no one else there but myself in disguise."" Next day the king again sent Maria do Pau to tend the ducks. And when she was in the field she did the same thing as the day before. She took off her wooden dress, washed and combed herself carefully, put on the robe the color of wild flowers, and went about driving the ducks, saying as before Ducks here, ducks there, The daughter of a king tends the ducks, A thing never seen before! After which she killed another duck. Next day she did as the day before, put on the robe of many colors, and killed another duck. In the evening when she went indoors, the king said to her, ""I do not wish you to take care of the ducks any longer, for every day we find a duck has been killed! Now you shall remain locked up in the house. We are to have a feast which will last three days, but I promise you that you shall not enjoy it, for I shall not allow you to go to it."" To this she said to the king, ""Oh! my liege, do let me go."" But the king replied, ""No, indeed, you shall not go."" On the first day of the feast she again begged of the king to allow her to repair to it, and his majesty replied, ""God, preserve me! What would be the consequences of taking Maria do Pau to the feast!"" The king put on his gala robes and then sent for her to his chamber, asked her what dress she would like to put on, and the princess replied by asking him to give her a pair of boots, which the king threw at her and took his departure for the feast. She then repaired to her chamber and removed from inside the dress made of wool a wand she had, which the little old woman, who was a fairy, had given her, and holding it up she said, ""Oh! divining rod, by the virtue that God gave you, send me here the best royal carriage, which is the very one that took the king to the feast."" The carriage was instantly in sight, and entering it she made her appearance at the feast, in the robe of the color of the stars. The king, who had his eyes continually fixed upon her, went out to the guards and told them not to allow the maiden to pass. But when she wished to get out she threw them a bag of money, and the guards allowed her to pass, but they asked her to what country she belonged, to which she replied that she came from the land of the boot. The king went home, and on arriving found the princess was already in the palace. The king, who wished to find out whether the lovely maiden which he had seen at the feast could possibly be Maria do Pau, went to see if she was safe in her chamber, and afterwards sent for her and said to her, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, do you happen to know where the land of the boot is situated?"" ""Oh! my liege, do not come troubling me with your questions. Is it possible that your majesty does not know where the land of the boot is situated?"" The king replied, ""I do not. A maiden was at the feast. I asked her where she came from, and she said that she came from the land of the boot, but I do not know where that is."" Next day the king again attended the feast, but before leaving he said to Maria do Pau, ''You shall not be allowed to go there."" ""Do allow me for once,"" replied she. The king then asked her to give him the towel, and as she presented him with it he threw it at her, and departed for the feast. The princess repaired to her room, struck the divining rod, and put on the robe, which was the color of the wild flowers. The king who had been charmed with her on the first day of the feast, now admired her all the more, because she appeared more beautiful than ever. He went out to the guards and told them to ask the beautiful maiden when she passed to what country she belonged; and when she went out she informed them that she was from the land of the towel. As soon as the king was told of this he returned to the palace to think over, and try to guess, if possible, where the land of the towel could be situated. And when he arrived at the palace the first thing he did was to ask his maid if she knew where the land of the towel could be found. To his inquiries she replied, ""Well, well! here comes a king who does not know, and cannot tell, where the land of the towel is situated! Neither do I know."" The king now said, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, every time that I have been at the feast I have seen such a pretty maiden. If the one I saw yesterday was beautiful, the one of today is perfectly lovely, and much more charming than the first."" Next day as the king was on the point of going out the princess said to his majesty, ""Oh! my liege, let me go to the feast, that I may see the maiden that is so beautiful!"" The king replied, ""God, preserve me! What would be the result if I were to present you before that maiden?"" After which he asked her to give him his walking stick, and as he was going out he struck her with it. He went to the feast, and when there the princess presented herself before him in the robe of many colors. If on the previous days she appeared most beautiful, on this day of the feast she looked perfectly ravishing, and more interesting than ever. The king fixed his eyes upon her so as not to lose sight of her, as he wished to see her go out, and follow her to where she lived, as it was the last day of the feast. But the king missed seeing her depart after all, and he could find her nowhere. He went to the guards and asked them what she had said, but the guards replied that she had come from the land of the walking stick. The king returned to the palace and inquired of his maid where the land of the walking stick could be found; but she replied, ""Oh! my liege, that I should know where the land of the walking stick is situated. Does not my liege know? Neither do I."" The king again asked her, ""Do you really not know? Today I again saw the same girl who is so beautiful; but I begin to think it cannot be the same one every time, because at one time she says that she comes from the land of the boot, next time that she is from the land of the towel, and lastly she says she is from the land of the walking stick. The princess repaired to her room, washed and combed herself, and dressed herself in the robe she had on on the first day of the feast. The king went to look through the keyhole to find out why she was so long away and remained in her chamber so quiet, and also to see what she was at. He saw a lovely maiden, the same one who had appeared at the feast dressed in the robe the color of the stars in the heavens, sitting down busy with some embroidery. When the princess left her chamber to repair to the dinner table again disguised the king said to her, ""Oh! Maria do Pau, you must embroider a pair of shoes for me."" She replied, ""Do I know how to embroider shoes?"" and she left the parlor to go back to her chamber. Every day she put on one of the dresses she had worn at the feast, and on the last day she robed herself with the one of many colors. The king begged her every day to embroider him a pair of shoes, and she always returned the same answer. He had a key made to open the princess's room, and one day when he saw through the keyhole that she was robed in her best, he suddenly opened the door without her perceiving it and entered the chamber. The princess startled, and very much frightened, tried to run away, but the king said to her, ""Do not be troubled for you shall marry me! But I wish you first to tell me your history, and why it is that you wear a wooden dress."" The princess recounted all the events of her life, and the king married her. The king next sent for the little old woman who had given her the wand, to come and live in the palace, but she refused to live there because she was a fairy.",Portugal,NA,"Consiglieri Pedroso, Portuguese Folk-Tales, translated from the original manuscript by Henriqueta Monteiro (London: Folk Lore Society, 1882), no. 16, pp. 66-72.",NA
"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The She-Bear,"Now it is said that once upon a time there lived a king of Roccaspra, who had a wife who for beauty, grace, and comeliness exceeded all other women. Truly she was the mother of beauty, but this beautiful being, at the full time of her life, fell from the steed of health, and broke the threads of life. But before the candle of life was finally put out, she called her husband, and said, ""I know well, that you have loved me with excessive love, therefore show me a proof of your love and give me a promise that you will never marry, unless you meet one beautiful as I have been; and if you will not so promise, I will leave you a curse, and I will hate you even in the other world."" The king, who loved her above all things, hearing this her last will, began to weep and lament, and for a while could not find a word to say; but after his grief subsided, he replied, ""If I ever think of taking a wife, may the gout seize me, and may I become as gaunt as an asparagus; oh my love, forget it. Do not believe in dreams, nor that I can ever put my affection upon another woman. You will take with you all my joy and desire."" And while he was thus speaking, the poor lady, who was at her last, turned up her eyes and stretched her feet. When the king saw that her soul had taken flight, his eyes became fountains of tears, and he cried with loud cries, buffeted his face, and wept, and wailed, so that all the courtiers ran to his side. He continually called upon the name of that good soul and cursed his fate, which had deprived him of her, and tore his hair, and pulled out his beard, and accused the stars of having sent to him this great misfortune. But he did as others do. A bump on the elbow and the loss of a wife cause much pain, but it does not last. The one pain disappears at one's side, and the other into the grave. Night had not yet come forth to look about the heavens for the bats, when he began to make count on his fingers, saying ""My wife is dead, and I am a widower, and sad hearted without hope of any kind but my only daughter, since she left me. Therefore it will be necessary to find another wife that will bear me a son. But where can I find one? Where can I meet a woman endowed with my wife's beauty, when all other females seem witches in my sight? There is the rub! Where shall I find another like unto her? Where am I to seek her with a bell, if nature formed Nardella (may her soul rest in glory), and then broke the mould? Alas! in what labyrinth am I! What a mistake was the promise I made her! But what? I have not seen the wolf yet, but I am running away already. Let us seek, let us see, and let us understand. Is it possible, that there is no other donkey in the stable except for Nardella? Is it possible that the world will be lost for me? Will there be such a plague that all women will be destroyed and their seed lost?"" And thus saying, he commanded the public crier to proclaim that all the beautiful women in the world should come and undergo the comparison of beauty, that he would take to wife the best looking of all, and make her the queen of his realm. This news spread in all parts of the world, and not one of the women in the whole universe failed to come and try this venture. Not even flayed hags stayed behind, they came by the dozen, because, when the point of beauty is touched, there is none who will yield, there is no sea monster who will give herself up as hideous; each and everyone boasts of uncommon beauty. If a donkey speaks the truth, the mirror is blamed for not reflecting the form as it is naturally; it is the fault of the quicksilver at the back. And now the land was full of women, and the king ordered that they should all stand in file, and he began to walk up and down, like a sultan when he enters his harem, to choose the best Genoa stone to sharpen his damascene blade. He came and went, up and down, like a monkey who is never still, looking and staring at this one and that one. One had a crooked brow, another a long nose, one a large mouth, and another thick lips. This one was too tall and gaunt, that other was short and badly formed, this one was too much dressed, another was too slightly robed. He disliked the Spanish woman because of the hue of her skin; the Neapolitan was not to his taste because of the way in which she walked; the German seemed to him too cold and frozen; the French woman too light of brains; the Venetian a spinning wheel full of flax. At last, for one reason or another, he sent them all about their business with one hand in front and another behind. Seeing so many beautiful heads of celery turned to hard roots and having resolved to marry nevertheless, he turned to his own daughter, saying, ""What am I seeking about these Marys of Ravenna, if my daughter Preziosa is made from the same mould as her mother? I have this beautiful face at home, and yet I should go to the end of the world seeking it?"" Thus he explained to his daughter his desire, and was severely reproved and censured by her, as Heaven knows. The king was angry at her rejection, and said to her, ""Be quiet and hold your tongue. Make up your mind to tie the matrimonial knot with me this very evening; otherwise when I finish with you there will be nothing left but your ears."" Preziosa, hearing this threat, retired to her room, and wept and lamented her evil fate. And while she lay there in this plight, an old woman, who used to bring her cosmetics, came to her, and finding her in such a plight, looking like one more ready for the other world than for this one, enquired the cause of her distress. When the old woman learned what had happened, she said, ""Be of good cheer, my daughter, and despair not, for every evil has a remedy. Death alone has no cure. Now listen to me: When your father comes to you this evening -- donkey that he is, wanting to act the stallion -- put this piece of wood into your mouth, and you will at once become a she-bear. Then you can make your escape, for he will be afraid of you and let you go. Go straight to the forest, for it was written in the book of fate, the day that you were born, that there you should meet your fortune. When you want to turn back into a woman as you are and will ever be, take the bit of wood out of your mouth, and you will return to your pristine form."" Preziosa embraced and thanked the old woman, told the servants to give her an apron full of flour and some slices of ham, and sent her away. When the sun began to change her quarters like a bankrupt strumpet, the king sent for his minister, and had him issue invitations to all the lords and grandees to come to the marriage feast. They all crowded in. After spending five or six hours in high revelry and unrestrained eating, the king made his way to the bed chamber, and called to the bride to come and fulfil his desire. But she put the bit of wood into her mouth, and instantly took the shape of a fierce she-bear, and stood thus before him. He, frightened at the sudden change, rolled himself up in the bedding, and did not put forth a finger or an eye until morning. Meanwhile Preziosa made her way toward the forest, where the shadows met concocting together how they could annoy the sun. There she lay in good fellowship and at one with the other animals. When the day dawned, it happened by chance that the son of the King of Acquacorrente should come to that forest. He sighted the she-bear and was greatly frightened, but the beast came forward, and wagging her tail, walked around him, and put her head under his hand for him to caress her. He took heart at this strange sight, smoothed its head as he would have done to a dog, and said to it, ""Lie down, down, quiet, quiet, there there, good beast."" Seeing that the beast was very tame, he took her home with him, commanding his servants to put her in the garden by the side of the royal palace, and there to attend to and feed her well, and treat her as they would his own person, and to take her to a particular spot so that he might see her from the windows of his palace whenever he had a mind to. Now it so happened that one day all his people were away on some errand, and the prince being left alone, thought about the bear, and looked out of the window to see her. However, at that very moment Preziosa, believing she was utterly alone, had taken the bit of wood from her mouth, and stood combing her golden hair. The prince was amazed at this woman of great beauty, and he descended the stairs and ran to the garden. But Preziosa, perceiving the ambush, at once put the bit of wood into her mouth, and became a she-bear once more. The prince looked about, but could not see what he had sighted from above, and not finding what he came to seek, remained very disappointed, and was melancholy and sad hearted, and in a few days became grievously ill. He kept repeating, ""Oh my bear, oh my bear."" His mother, hearing this continual cry, imagined that perhaps the bear had bit him or done him some evil, and therefore ordered the servants to kill her. But all the servants loved the beast because it was so very tame, even the stones in the roadway could not help liking her, so they had compassion and could not think of killing her. Therefore they led her to the forest, and returning to the queen, told her that she was dead. When this deed came to the prince's ears, he acted as a madman, and leaving his bed, ill as he was, was about to make mincemeat of the servants. They told him the truth of the affair. He mounted his steed and searched backward and forward until at length he came to a cave and found the bear. He carried her home with him and put her in a chamber, saying, ""Oh you beautiful morsel fit for kings, why do you hide your passing beauty in a bear's hide? Oh light of love, why are you closed in such an hairy lantern? Why have you acted this way toward me, is it so that you may see me die a slow death? I am dying of despair, charmed by your beautiful form, and you can see the witness of my words in my failing health and sickening form. I am become skin and bone, and the fever burns my very marrow, and consumes me with heart-sore pain. Therefore lift the veil from that stinking hide, and let me behold once more your grace and beauty; lift up the leaves from this basket's mouth, and let me take a view of the splendid fruit within; lift the tapestry, and allow my eyes to feast upon the luxury of your charms. Who has enclosed in a dreary prison such a glorious work? Who has enclosed in a leather casket such a priceless treasure? Let me behold your passing grace, and take in payment all my desires. Oh my love, only this bear's grease can cure the nervous disease of which I suffer."" But perceiving that his words had no effect, and that all was time lost, he took to his bed, and his illness increased daily, until the doctors feared for his life. The queen, his mother, who had no other love in the world, sat at his bedside, and said to him, ""Oh my son, where does your heartsickness come from? What is the cause of all this sadness? You are young, you are rich, you are beloved, you are great. What do you want, my son? Speak, for only a shameful beggar carries an empty pocket. If you desire to take a wife, choose, and I will command; take, and I will pay. Can you not see that your sickness is my sickness and that your pulse beats in unison with my heart? If you burn with fever in your blood, I burn with fever on the brain. I have no other support for my old age but you. Therefore, my son, be cheerful, and cheer my heart, and do not darken this realm, and raze to the ground this house, and bereave your mother."" The prince, hearing these words, said, ""Nothing can cheer me, if I may not see the bear; therefore, if you desire to see me in good health again, let her stay in this room, and I do not wish that any other serve me, and make my bed, and cook my meals, if it be not herself, and if what I desire be done, I am sure that I shall be well in a few days."" To the queen it seemed folly for her son to ask that a bear should act as cook and housemaid. She believed that the prince must be delirious; nevertheless, to please his fancy, she went for the bear, and when the beast came to the prince's bedside she lifted her paw and felt the invalid's pulse. The queen smiled at the sight, thinking that by and by the bear would scratch the prince's nose. But the prince spoke to the bear, and said, ""Oh mischievous mine, will you not cook for me, and feed me, and serve me?"" And the bear nodded yes with her head, showing that she would accept the charge. Then the queen sent for some chickens, and had a fire lit in the fireplace in the same chamber, and had a kettle with boiling water put on the fire. The bear took hold of a chicken, scalded it, dexterously plucked off its feathers, cleaned it, put half of it on the spit, and stewed the other half. When it was ready, the prince, who could not before eat even sugar, ate it all and licked his fingers. When he had ended his meal, the bear brought him some drink, and handed it so gracefully that the queen kissed her on the head. After this the prince arose, and went to the salon to receive the doctors, and to be directed by their judgment. The bear at once made the bed, ran to the garden and gathered a handful of roses and orange blossoms, which she scattered upon the bed. She fulfilled her various duties so well that the queen said to herself, ""This bear is worth a treasure, and my son is quite right in being fond of the beast."" When the prince returned to his chambers, and saw how well the bear had fulfilled her duties, it was like adding fuel to the fire. If he had been consumed himself in a slow fire before, he was now burning with intense heat. He said to the queen ""Oh my lady mother, if I cannot give a kiss to this bear, I shall give up the ghost."" The queen, seeing her son nearly fainting, said to the bear, ""Kiss him, kiss him, oh my beautiful bear, do not leave my poor son to die in despair."" Then the bear obediently neared the prince, who took her cheeks between his fingers, could not stop kissing her on the lips. While thus engaged, I do not know how it happened, the bit of wood fell from Preziosa's mouth, and she remained in the prince's embrace, the most beautiful and ravishing being in the world. He strained her to his bosom with tightly clasped arms, and said, ""You are caught at last, and you shall not escape so easily without a reason."" Preziosa, reddening with the lovely tint of modesty and of shame, the most beautiful of natural beauties, answered, ""I am in your hands. I surrender my honor to your loyalty. Do with me what you will."" The queen asked who this charming woman was, and what had caused her to live such a wild life. She related to them all her misfortunes, and the queen praised her as a good and honored child, and said to her son that she was well satisfied that he should marry the princess. The prince, who wanted nothing else, at once announced his betrothal to her. Kneeling before the queen, they both received her blessing, and with great feasting the marriage took place. Thus Preziosa demonstrated the truth of the proverb: ""Those who do good may expect good in return.""","Italy, Giambattista Basile","Source: Il Pentamorone; or, The Tale of Tales, translated by Richard F.

"The Father Who Wanted to Marry His
Daughter",0510b,The Story of Catskin,"Note by D. L. Ashliman: The conflict between father and daughter in most folktales of type 510B derives from the mother's death and the father's subsequent attempts to marry his own daughter, as evidenced in the previous tales at this site. In some versions, however, the incest motif is suppressed, and the conflict between father and daughter is given a different motivation. The following tale, told here in verse, illustrates this minority group. The heroine here is not at risk because of her father's incestuous desires, but for an inclination much less governed by taboo: his displeasure over the birth of a female child. Note also that the abusive relationship between the heroine and the man she will ulitmately marry has also been altered in this version. She receives the same blows, but from the hands of her female employer, not her future husband. And now, an English version of Catskin: His lady's again in the way, So she said to her husband with joy, ""I hope some or other fine day, To present you, my dear, with a boy."" The gentleman answered gruff, ""If't should turn out a maid or a mouse, For of both we have more than enough, She shan't stay to live in my house."" The lady, at this declaration, Almost fainted away with pain; But what was her sad consternation, When a sweet little girl came again. She sent her away to be nurs'd, Without seeing her gruff papa; And when she was old enough, To a school she was packed away. Fifteen summers are fled, Now she left good Mrs. Jervis; To see home she was forbid, She determined to go and seek service. Her dresses so grand and so gay, She carefully rolled in a knob; Which she hid in a forest away, And put on a catskin robe. She knock'd at a castle gate, And pray'd for charity; They sent her some meat on a plate, And kept her a scullion to be. My lady look'd long in her face, And prais'd her great beauty; I'm sorry I've no better place, And you must our scullion be. So Catskin was under the cook, A very sad life she led, For often a ladle she took, And broke poor Catskin's head. There is now a grand ball to be, When ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook,"" said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" A basin of water she took, And dash'd in poor Catskin's face; But briskly her ears she shook, And went in her hiding place. She washed every stain from her skin, In some crystal waterfall; Then put on a beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. When she entered, the ladies were mute, Overcome by her figure and face; But the lord, her young master, at once Fell in love with her beauty and grace; He pray'd her his partner to be, She said, ""Yes!"" with a sweet smiling glance; All night with no other lady But Catskin, our young lord would dance. ""Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"" For now was the sad parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Basin of Water I dwell. Then she flew from the ballroom, and put On her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. The young lord, the very next day, To his mother his passion betrayed; He declared he never would rest, Till he'd found out this beautiful maid. There's another grand ball to be, Where ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook,"" said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You dirty impudent slut! Among the fine ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" In a rage the ladle she took, And broke poor Catkin's head; But off she went shaking her ears, And swift to her forest she fled. She washed every blood stain off In some crystal waterfall; Put on a more beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said ""Yes!"" with her first smiling glance; And again, all the night, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin did dance. ""Pray tell me,"" said he, ""where you live?"" For now 'twas the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Ladle I dwell. Then she flew from the ball, and put on Her catskin robe again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. My lord did again, the next day, Declare to his mother his mind, That he never more happy should be, Unless he his charmer should find. Now another grand ball is to be, Where ladies their beauties show; ""Mrs. Cook"", said Catskin, ""dear me, How much I should like to go!"" ""You go with your catskin robe, You impudent, dirty slut! Among the find ladies and lords, A very fine figure you'd cut."" In a fury she took the skimmer, And broke poor Catskin's head; But heart-whole and lively as ever, Away to her forest she fled. She washed the stains of blood In some crystal waterfall; Then put on her most beautiful dress, And hasted away to the ball. My lord, at the ballroom door, Was waiting with pleasure and pain; He longed to see nothing so much As the beautiful Catskin again. When he asked her to dance, she again Said ""Yes!"" with her first smiling glance; And all the night long, my young Lord With none but fair Catskin would dance. ""Pray tell me, fair maid, where you live?"" For now was the parting time; But she no other answer would give, Than this distich of mystical rhyme, -- Kind sir, if the truth I must tell, At the sign of the Broken Skimmer I dwell. Then she flew from the hall, and threw on Her catskin cloak again; And slipt in unseen by the cook, Who little thought where she had been. But not by my lord unseen, For this time he followed too fast; And, hid in the forest green, Saw the strange things that past. Next day he took to his bed, And sent for the doctor to come; And begg'd him no other than Catskin, Might come into his room. He told him how dearly he lov'd her, Not to have her his heart would break; Then the doctor kindly promised To the proud old lady to speak. There's a struggle of pride and love, For she fear'd her son would die; But pride at the last did yield, And love had the mastery. Then my lord got quickly well, When he was his charmer to wed; And Catskin, before a twelvemonth, Of a young lord was brought to bed. To a wayfaring woman and child, Lady Catskin one day sent an alms; The nurse did the errand, and carried The sweet little lord in her arms. The child gave the alms to the child, This was seen by the old lady mother; ""Only see,"" said that wicked old woman, ""How the beggars' brats take to each other!"" This throw went to Catskin's heart, She flung herself down on her knees, And pray'd her young master and lord To seek out her parents would please. They sent out in my lord's own coach; They traveled, but naught befell Till they reach'd the town hard by Where Catskin's father did dwell. They put up at the head inn, Where Catskin was left alone; But my lord went to try if her father His natural child would own. When folks are away, in short time What great alterations appear; For the cold touch of death had all chill'd The hearts of her sisters dear. Her father repented too late, And the loss of his youngest bemoan'd; In his old and childless state, He his pride and cruelty own'd. The old gentleman sat by the fire, And hardly looked up at my lord; He had no hope of comfort A stranger could afford. But my lord drew a chair close by, And said, in a feeling tone, ""Have you not, sir, a daughter, I pray, You never would see or own?"" The old man alarm'd, cried aloud, ""A hardened sinner am I! I would give all my worldly goods, To see her before I die."" Then my lord brought his wife and child To their home and parent's face, Who fell down and thanks returned To God, for his mercy and grace. The bells, ringing up in the tower, Are sending a sound to the heart; There's a charm in the old church bells, Which nothing in life can impart!","England, James Orchard Halliwell","Source: James Orchard Halliwell, The Nursery Rhymes of England (London: F.

The Fisherman and His Wife,0555,Hanns Dudeldee,"A long time ago, many hundreds of years ago, there lived a fisherman with his wife. His name was Dudeldee. They were so poor that they did not have a real house, but lived in a hut made of boards without any windows. They looked out through the knot holes. In spite all this, Dudeldee was satisfied, but not his wife. She wished for this or that and constantly tormented her husband because he could not give it to her. Dudeldee usually said nothing, thinking only to himself, ""If only I were rich,"" or ""If only I could have everything I wished for."" One evening he was standing with his wife before their front door looking around their neighborhood. There were a number of handsome farmhouses nearby. Then his wife said to him, ""If we only had a hut as good as the worst of our neighbors' houses. We could have such a one, but you are too lazy. You can't work the way other people work."" Dudeldee asked, ""What? Don't I work as hard as other people? Don't I stand there fishing the entire day?"" ""No!"" answered his wife. ""You could get up earlier and catch as many fish before daybreak as you now get during the whole day. But you are too lazy. You don't want to do anything."" And thus she scolded him on and on. So the next morning he got up early and went out to the lake to fish. By the time he saw people going to their fields to work he still had caught nothing. Noon came, and the mowers sat in the shade and ate their noon meals, and still he had caught nothing. Sadly he sat down and pulled his moldy bread from his pocket and ate it. Then he went back to fishing. The sun moved downward, and the mowers went home, the shepherds drove their herds into their enclosures, the cow herds returned home, and the fields grew quiet. But Dudeldee still stood there, and still he had not even one little fish. It was almost dark when he thought about going home. He would throw out his net just one more time and try to catch something. He threw it out, and as if were trying to lure the fish into it, he called out: asked a little fish that had swum up, sticking his head a little above the water. Poor Hanns Dudeldee was startled to see the little fish, but he collected himself and thought, ""If all I have to do is to want something, you will not have to ask me again."" He looked around to see what he might wish for. On the other side of the lake there stood a handsome palace from which he could hear the beautiful music of horns resounding. At the same time he thought of his wife's wish to have a better house, so he said, ""I would like a country house like that one over there. I would like such a palace instead of my little board hut."" ""Just go home,"" said the little fish. ""Your board hut is now such a palace."" More running than walking, Hanns Dudeldee returned home. Already at some distance, he saw that at the place where his house formerly stood there was now a splendid palace with brightly illuminated rooms. Entering, he saw that everything was so splendid that he did not know how to behave. The entryway was paved with marble. The living-room floor was of inlaid wood, and polished with wax. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Magnificent chandeliers hung in the high halls. In short, everything was so beautiful that Hans Dudeldee did not dare to walk around inside. He could not believe that this was his property. He thought he had entered the wrong house and would have left, if his wife had not met him on the steps. He had scarcely seen her when he asked her, ""Now are you satisfied with the house?"" and he told her what had happened. ""What?"" she answered. ""Do you think that what we have here is a miracle? I saw much better houses in the city when I was in service there. It is passable, but how could you be so stupid? You forgot the best things. Just look at our clothes against this nice house! See how they stand out! At the same time you should have wished for beautiful clothes for me and for you. But you are too stupid and lazy. You don't even make use of the little bit of intelligence that you have."" And thus she continued to scold and bicker until she fell asleep. The next morning at daybreak Hanns Dudeldee went back to the same place, once again threw out his net, and once again called out: Thus replied the little fish once again, and Dudeldee did not have to think long before saying that he wanted beautiful clothing for his wife and for himself, clothing that was appropriate for their new house. ""You have it,"" said the little fish, and Dudeldee stood there wearing a cloth jacket with gold braid, silk stockings and shoes, and an embroidered vest, everything in keeping with the fashion of the time. Returning home, he would have scarcely recognized his wife in her silk clothing, but she looked out the window and asked, ""Hanns, is that you?"" ""Yes,"" he answered. ""Are you satisfied now?"" ""We'll see!"" she answered. Thus they lived peacefully for a time. But one day, when her husband wanted to go out fishing again, she said, ""Why do you need to go fishing? Give that up and instead wish for yourself a chest filled with gold."" ""Hmm, that is true!"" thought Dudeldee, and he went out to the lake, once again threw out his net and called out: asked the little fish once again. ""Oh, a chest filled with gold,"" he said. ""Just go home,"" said the little fish And when he arrived home, standing in his bedroom was a chest filled with gold pieces. Thus they lived high and well. She bought herself a coach and horses, and a riding horse for her husband. They often drove into the cities, and they engaged a cook and servants. The neighbors always called her the arrogant fishwife. This annoyed her greatly, so she told her husband to make her the ruler over all the neighbors. Once again he went out with his net, threw it into the water, and called out: asked the little fish. ""I would like to be a nobleman or a count and to rule over all my neighbors."" ""Just go home. It is so."" When he arrived home the neighbors were paying homage to his wife. She already had had a few of the neighbor women locked up who previously had called her the arrogant fishwife. Now they often drove to the capital city where the king resided, wanting to join company with other counts. But they did not know how to conduct themselves with the manners of nobility, and everyone ridiculed them. Some countesses would refer to her only as Fish Countess and him as Fish Count Dudeldee. So she again spoke to her husband, ""Go out and have yourself made king. I do not want to be called Fish Countess any longer. I want to be queen."" However, Hanns Dudeldee advised her against this, saying, ""Just remember how it was when we were poor, and we wished for a little hut as good as the worst of our neighbors' houses. Now we have a surplus of everything. Let us call it enough."" But his wife did not want to call it enough, and she said, ""What? I am to put up with being called Fish Countess? I am to bear the city women's pride? No! They must know who I am. I shall show them! And yet you want to be so simple as to accept all this?"" And thus she scolded forth, until he promised to make her queen. Consequently he went out to the sea, repeated once again his little verse, and the little fish again appeared and again asked, ""What do you want, Count Dudeldee?"" He presented the request, that he would like to be king. The little fish said, ""You are!"" Returning home, he found that his palace had changed magnificently. It was now much larger. Marshals and ministers with a golden star and golden keys received him with deep bows. His head suddenly became very heavy. He wanted to take off his hat, but behold! Instead of a hat he had a heavy golden crown on his head. And when he saw his wife, he hardly recognized her, so much did her gown glisten with gold and jewels. When he asked her if she was now satisfied, she said, ""Yes, until I once again come to know something better. I would be a fool if I could be better off, and did not do so."" Thus they lived contentedly for a time, and Dudeldee's wife did not wish for anything further, for she had everything that she possibly could want. She had even taken revenge on the countesses who had called her Countess Fish. But finally she came to lack something. She read in the newspaper about the luxury and the expenditures at other kings' courts, and heard that there were other kings and emperors who ruled over many more people and over much more powerful kingdoms than did Dudeldee. Consequently she again approached him, and tormented him until he promised her to become the most powerful king on earth. Once again he threw out his net, and called out: asked the little fish, and Dudeldee said, ""Just make me the most powerful king or emperor on earth."" And immediately that is what he was. When he arrived home ambassadors and deputies from all the kingdoms and all the parts of the earth were there. Poor poets with poems to Atlas awaited him. Schoolmasters who needed better salaries were there with their petitions. Chamberlains, with their hats under their arms, walked back and forth. Peasants engaged in lawsuits wanted an audience. Guards walked up and down. A coach with ten horses, twenty cavaliers, and six couriers was standing there, ready to depart. In an adjacent courtyard there were peacocks and guinea fowls. In short, everything was there that would please such a great emperor. There were even two court jesters who were always near him. The new Emperor Dudeldee was of course angry that these two foolish people were always following him about wherever he might go, and he complained to his wife about them, for after all, he would rather be in the company of reasonable people than of fools. But she told him that he did not understand. It just had to be that way. All important gentlemen preferred to be with fools. Now he was not going to be a fool himself and make an exception. Finally he gave in, and was happy that his wife was satisfied, but their happiness did not last long. One day he came to her and found her very sad. ""What is wrong?"" he asked her. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I am unhappy about the rainy weather. It has lasted four days now, and I would like to have some sunshine. In fact, I wish that I could do everything that God can do, so that I could have spring and summer and fall and winter exactly when I wanted them."" Thus she spoke to him, and he liked her idea as well. ""Why,"" he thought, ""then I could go out in the rain and come home in the sunshine that my wife had made. I could even get rid of the fools."" Thinking this to himself, he immediately took his fishing net and slipped out a back entrance into the rain. He went to the sea, threw in his net, and again said, as before: the little fish asked. ""Oh,"" he said, ""only that my wife would like to be able to do whatever God can do: make rain and sunshine, and have spring and summer and fall and winter exactly when she wants them."" ""So! Is that all?"" asked the little fish. ""No, no, Emperor Dudeldee, I see that nothing is good enough for you and your wife. Therefore become the old fisherman Dudeldee once again, for then you were not as proud and unsatisfied as you are now. Then the little fish disappeared. Hanns Dudeldee called out repeatedly: But no little fish asked: And there he stood, as before, without a jacket, wearing only his dirty leather trousers. And when he returned home, the palace was gone. His little board hut was standing there again, with his wife inside in her dirty clothing and looking out through a knothole, as before, and once again she was the wife of Fisherman Dudeldee.","Germany, Albert Ludewig Grimm","Source: Albert Ludewig Grimm, ""Hanns Dudeldee: ein Mährchen,"" Kindermährchen (Heidelberg: Mohr und Zimmer, [1809], pp. 77-92.","The Old Man, His Wife, and the Fish (Russia).

The Fisherman and His Wife,0555,The Bullock's Balls,"In a certain place there lived a large bullock by the name of Tîkschnabrischana, which means ""having substantial balls."" Because of his excessive pride, he left his herd and wandered about in the forest, tearing up the banks as he pleased and devouring the emerald-colored grass. In this same forest there lived a jackal by the name of Pralobhaka, which means ""the greedy one."" One day he was sitting pleasantly with his wife on an island in the river. Tîkschnabrischana came up to this island to have a drink of water. When the jackal's wife saw the balls, she said to her husband, ""Master, just look! This bullock has two pieces of meat hanging down. They will be falling off immediately, at the least in a few hours. Take heed of this, and follow him."" The jackal answered, ""Loved one, there is nothing certain about their falling off. Why do you ask me to set forth on such a futile task? Let me stay here with you, and together we can eat the mice that come here to drink. This is their pathway. If I leave you to follow the bullock, then someone else will come here and take over this spot. It is not a good idea, for it is said: He who gives up a sure thing for an uncertainty will lose the sure thing, and the uncertainty will remain just that."" The jackal's wife said, ""Oh, you are a low-spirited creature. You are satisfied with the worst things that you can find. They also say: It is easy to fill a little brook and also the paws of a little mouse. Ordinary people are easily satisfied. They are pleased with the smallest things. For this reason a good man must always be active. They also say: With every beginning there is a will to act. Avoid idleness, and join the community of the intelligent and the powerful. Think not that fate alone rules. Cease not to work. Without effort the sesame seed will not give up its oil. And further: A foolish man is happy with little. His heart is satisfied just thinking of wealth. It is thus not appropriate for you to say, 'It is uncertain, whether or not they will fall off.' It is also said: Active people deserve praise. Those with pride will be praised. What sort of scoundrel will wait until Indra brings him water? Furthermore, I am mightily tired of eating mouse meat. These two pieces of meat look as though they will soon fall off. You must follow him. Nothing else will do!"" After hearing all this, the jackal left his mouse catching, and followed after Tîkschnabrischana. They rightly say: A man is master in all things, until he lets his will be turned by a woman's words. And further: The impossible seems possible, the unachievable easily achieved, and the inedible edible to the man who is spurred on by a woman's words. Thus, together with his wife, he followed the bullock a long time, but the two balls did not fall off. In the fifteenth year, the jackal finally said wearily to his wife, ""Fifteen years, my love, I have kept my eyes on those hanging things to see whether or not they are going to fall off, but they still hold fast. Nor will they fall off in the future. Let us return to catching mice!""",India,"Source: Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen, translated from the Sanskrit into German by Theodor Benfey, vol. 2 (Leipzig: F.

The Fisherman and His Wife,0555,The Fisherman and His Wife,"There was once upon a time a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a piss pot near the sea. Every day the fisherman went out fishing, and he fished a long time. Once he was sitting there fishing and looking into the clear water when his hook went to the bottom, deep down, and when he pulled it out, he had caught a large flounder. Then the flounder said to him, ""I beg you to let me live. I am not an ordinary flounder, but an enchanted prince. Put me back into the water, and let me swim."" ""Well,"" said the man, ""there's no need to say more. I can certainly let a fish swim away who knows how to talk."" Then he put it back into the water, and the flounder quickly disappeared to the bottom, leaving a long trail of blood behind him. The man then went home to his wife in the piss pot and told her that he had caught a flounder that had told him he was an enchanted prince, and that he had let it swim away. ""Didn't you ask for anything first?"" said the woman. ""No,"" said the man. What should I have asked for?"" ""Oh,"" said the woman. ""It is terrible living in this piss pot. It is filled with stench and filth. Go back and ask for a little hut for us."" The man did not want to, but he went back to the sea, and when he arrived it was all yellow and green, and he stood next to the water and said: The flounder swam up and said, ""What does she want then?"" ""Oh,"" said the man, ""I did catch you, and my wife says that I really should have asked for something. She doesn't want to live in a piss pot any longer. She would like to have a hut."" ""Go home,"" said the flounder. ""She already has it."" The man went home, and his wife was standing in the door of a hut, and she said to him, ""Come in. See, now isn't this much better."" And there was a parlor and a bedroom and a kitchen; and outside there was a little garden with all kinds of vegetables, and a yard with hens and ducks. ""Oh,"" said the man. ""Now we can live well."" ""Yes,"" said the woman, ""we'll give it a try."" Everything went well for a week or two, and then the woman said, ""Husband. This hut is too small. The yard and the garden are too little. I want to live in a large stone castle. Go back to the flounder and tell him to get a castle for us."" ""Oh, wife,"" said the man. The flounder has just given us the hut. I don't want to go back so soon. It may make the flounder angry."" ""I know he can do it,"" said the woman, ""and he won't mind. Just go!"" So, with a heavy heart, the man went back, and when he came to the sea, the water was quite purple and gray and dark blue, but it was still, and he stood there and said: ""What does she want then?"" said the flounder. ""Oh,"" said the man sadly, ""my wife wants to live in a stone castle."" ""Go home. She's already standing before the door,"" said the flounder. So the man went home, and his wife was standing in front of a large palace. ""See, husband,"" she said. ""Isn't this beautiful?"" And with that they went inside together. There were many servants inside, and the walls were all white, and there were golden chairs and tables in the parlor, and outside the castle there was a garden and a forest a half mile long, and there were elk and deer and rabbits, and there were cow and horse stalls in the yard. ""Oh,"" said the man, ""now we can stay in this beautiful castle and be satisfied."" ""We'll think about it,"" said the woman. ""Let's sleep on it."" And with that they went to bed. The next morning the woman awoke. It was daylight. She poked her husband in the side with her elbow and said, ""Husband, get up. We should be king over all this land."" ""Oh, wife,"" said the man, ""why do you want to be king? I don't want to be king."" ""Well, I want to be king."" ""Oh, wife,"" said the man, ""how can you be king? The flounder won't want to do that."" ""Husband,"" said the woman, ""Go there immediately. I want to be king."" So the man, saddened because his wife wanted to be king, went back. And when he arrived at the sea it was dark gray, and the water heaved up from below. He stood there and said: ""What does she want then,"" said the flounder. ""Oh,"" said the man, ""my wife wants to be king."" ""Go home. She's already king,"" said the flounder. Then the man went home, and when he arrived at the palace, there were so many soldiers, and drums, and trumpets, and his wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds, and she was wearing a large golden crown and on either side of her there stood a line of maidens-in-waiting, each one a head shorter than the other. ""Oh,"" said the man, ""are you king now?"" ""Yes,"" she said, ""I am king."" And after he had looked at her awhile, he said, ""It is nice that you are king. Now we don't have to wish for anything else."" ""No, husband,"" she said, ""I have been king too long. I can't stand it any longer. I am king, but now I would like to become emperor."" ""Oh,"" said the man, ""why do you want to become emperor?"" ""Husband,"" she said, ""go to the flounder. I want to be emperor."" ""Oh, wife,"" said the man, ""he can't make you emperor. I can't tell him to do that."" ""I am king,"" said the woman, ""and you are my husband. Now go there immediately!"" So the man went, and on his way he thought, ""This is not going to end well. To ask to be emperor is shameful. The flounder is going to get tired of this."" With that he arrived at the sea. The water was entirely black and dense, and a strong wind blew over him that curdled the water. He stood there and said: ""What does she want then,"" said the flounder. ""Oh,"" he said, ""my wife wants to become emperor."" ""Go home,"" said the flounder. ""She's already emperor."" Then the man went home, and when he arrived, his wife was sitting on a very high throne made of one piece of gold, and she was wearing a large golden crown that was two yards high, and guards were standing at her side, each one smaller than the other, beginning with the largest giant and ending with the littlest dwarf, who was no larger than my little finger. Many princes and counts were standing in front of her. The man went and stood among them and said, ""Wife, are you emperor now?"" ""Yes,"" she said, ""I am emperor."" ""Oh,"" said the man, taking a good look at her. ""Wife, it's good that you are emperor."" ""Husband,"" she said. ""Why are you standing there? I'm emperor now, and I want to become pope as well."" ""Oh, wife!"" said the man. ""Why do you want to become pope. There is only one pope in all Christendom."" ""Husband,"" she said, ""I want to become pope before the day is done."" ""No, wife,"" he said, ""the flounder cannot make you pope. It's not good."" ""Husband, what nonsense! If he can make me emperor, then he can make me pope as well. Now go there immediately!"" Then the man went, and he felt sick all over, and his knees and legs were shaking, and the wind was blowing, and the water looked like it was boiling, and ships, tossing and turning on the waves, were firing their guns in distress. There was a little blue in the middle of the sky, but on all sides it had turned red, as in a terrible lightning storm. Full of despair he stood there and said: ""What does she want then?"" said the flounder. ""Oh,"" said the man, ""my wife wants to become pope."" ""Go home,"" said the flounder. ""She's already pope."" Then he went home, and when he arrived there, his wife was sitting on a throne that was two miles high, and she was wearing three large crowns. She was surrounded with church-like splendor, and at her sides there were two banks of candles. The largest was as thick and as tall as the largest tower, down to the smallest kitchen candle. ""Wife,"" said the man, giving her a good look, ""are you pope now?"" ""Yes,"" she said, ""I am pope."" ""Oh,"" said the man. ""It is good that you are pope. Wife, we can be satisfied, now that you are pope. There's nothing else that you can become."" ""I have to think about that,"" said the woman. Then they both went to bed, but she was not satisfied. Her desires would not let her sleep. She kept thinking what she wanted to become next. Then the sun came up. ""Aha,"" she thought, as she watched the sunrise through her window. ""Couldn't I cause the sun to rise?"" Then she became very grim and said to her husband, ""Husband, go back to the flounder. I want to become like God."" The man, who was still mostly asleep, was so startled that he fell out of bed. ""Oh, wife,"" he said, ""go on as you are and remain pope."" ""No,"" said the woman, tearing open her bodice. ""I will not be quiet. I can't stand it when I see the sun and the moon coming up, and I can't cause them to rise. I want to become like God!"" ""Oh, wife,"" said the man. ""The flounder can't do that. He can make you emperor and pope, but he can't do that."" ""Husband,"" she said, looking very gruesome, ""I want to become like God. Go to the flounder right now!"" The man trembled with fear at every joint. Outside there was a terrible storm. Trees and mountains were shaking. The heaven was completely black, and there was thunder and lightning. In the sea he could see black waves as high as mountains, and they were capped with white crowns of foam. He said: ""What does she want then,"" said the flounder. ""Oh,"" he said, ""she wants to become like God."" ""Go home. She is sitting in her piss pot again."" And they are sitting there even today.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Von den Fischer und siiner Fru,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, 1st ed.

The Grimms' source for this tale, recorded in wonderfully simple, but poetic Low German, was the romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge (1777-1810). In 1806 Runge sent a manuscript of this tale to the publisher of Achim von Arnim's and Clemens Brentano's collection of folk poetry Des Knaben Wunderhorn. In 1809 the manuscript was made available to the Grimm brothers, and they included the tale in the first edition (and -- with stylistic and dialect variations -- all succeeding editions) of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen. A somewhat different version of Runge's manuscript also found its way to Johann Gustav Büsching, who published the tale as no. 58 in his Volks-Sagen, Märchen und Legenden (Leipzig: Carl Heinrich Reclam, 1812), pp. 258-66. This work appeared before the Grimm's collection, which was also published in 1812. Translator's notes: The couple's place of residence, in the Grimms' Low German, is called a ""Pisputt."" (Büsching was more cautious, using the truncated spelling ""P--pot."") Most translators give this unambiguously earthy word a figurative meaning in English. Thus, one sees ""shack,"" ""pigsty,"" ""miserable little hovel,"" ""dirty hovel,"" and ""chamber pot"" in various English translations. I have chosen to keep with the low road, and call a Pisputt a piss pot. I have left untranslated the formulaic introduction to the fisherman's oft-repeated call to the fish, ""Mandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!"" From other sources it is evident that ""Mandje"" is a dialect word for ""Little Man,"" as in High German ""Männchen."" ""Timpe Te"" appears to be the fisherman's name -- elsewhere he is called ""Domine"" or ""Dudeldee.""

The Fisherman and His Wife,0555,"The Old Man, His Wife, and the Fish","The fish spoke to him in a man's voice. ""Do not keep me, old man,"" it said; ""let me go once more free in the sea and I will reward you for it, for whatever you wish I will do."" The old man thought for a while. Then he said, ""Well, I don't want you. Go into the sea again,"" and he threw the fish into the water and went home. ""Well,"" said his wife, when he got home, ""what have you caught today?"" ""Only one little fish,"" said the man, ""a golden fish, and that I let go again, it begged so hard. 'Put me in the blue sea again,' it said, ' and I will reward you, for whatever you wish I will do.' So I let it go, and did not ask anything."" ""Ah, you old fool!"" said the wife in a great rage, ""what an opportunity you have lost. You might, at least, have asked the fish to give us some bread. We have scarce a crust in the house."" The old woman grumbled so much that her husband could have no quiet, so to please her off he went to the seashore, and there he cried out: ""My wife,"" said the man, ""is in a great passion, and has sent me to ask for bread."" ""Very well,"" said the fish, ""go home and you shall have it."" The old man went back, and when he entered the hut he found bread in plenty. ""Well,"" said he to his wife, ""we have enough bread now."" ""Oh yes!"" said she, ""but I have had such a misfortune while you were away. I have broken the bucket. What shall I do the washing in now? Go to the fish, and ask it to give us a new bucket."" Away went the man. Standing on the shore he called out: ""My wife,"" said the man, "" has had a misfortune, and has broken our bucket. So I have come to ask for a new one."" ""Very well,"" said the fish, ""you shall find one at home."" The old man went back. As soon as he got home his wife said to him, ""Be off to the golden fish again, and ask it to give us a new hut. Ours is all coming to pieces. We have scarcely a roof over our heads."" The old man once more came to the shore, and cried: ""My wife,"" said the man, ""is in a very bad temper, and has sent me to ask you to build us a new cottage. She says she cannot live any longer in our present one."" ""Oh, do not be troubled about that,"" said the fish. ""Go home. You shall have what you want."" The old man went back again, and in the place of his miserable hovel he found a new hut built of oak and nicely ornamented. The old man was delighted, but as soon as he went in his wife set on him, saying, ""What an idiot you are! You do not know how to take good fortune when it is offered to you. You think you have done a great thing just because you have got a new hut. Be off again to the golden fish, and tell it I will not be a mere peasant's wife any longer, I will be an archduchess, with plenty of servants, and set the fashion."" The old man went to the golden fish. ""What is it?"" asked the fish. ""My wife will not let me rest,"" replied the man; ""she wants now to be an archduchess, and is not content with being my wife."" ""Well, it shall be as she wishes. Go home again,"" said the fish. Away went the man. How astonished was he, when, on coming to where his house had stood, he now found a fine mansion, three stories high. Servants crowded the hall, and cooks were busy in the kitchens. On a seat in a fine room sat the man's wife, dressed in robes shining with gold and silver, and giving orders. ""Good day, wife!"" said the man. ""Who are you, man?"" said his wife. ""What have you to do with me, a fine lady? Take the clown away,"" said she to her servants. ""Take him to the stable, and whip some of the impudence out of him."" The servants seized the old man, took him off to the stable, and when they had him there beat him so that he hardly knew whether he was alive or not. After that the wife made him the doorkeeper of the house. She gave him a besom, and put him to keep the yard in order. As for his meals, he got them in the kitchen. He had a hard life of it. If the yard was not swept clean, he had to look out. ""Who would have thought she had been such a hag?"" said the old man to himself. ""Here she has all such good fortune, and will not even own me for her husband!"" After a time the wife got tired of being merely an archduchess, so she said to her husband, ""Go off to the golden fish, and tell it I will be a czarina."" The old man went down to the shore. He cried: ""My wife is not yet satisfied,"" said the man; ""she wants now to be a czarina,"" ""Do not let that trouble you,"" said the fish, ""but go to your house. ""What you ask shall be done."" The man went back. In place of the fine house he found a palace with a roof of gold. Soldiers were on guard around it. In front of the palace was a garden, and at the back a fine park, in which some troops were parading. On a balcony stood the czarina surrounded by officers and nobles. The troops presented arms, the drums beat, the trumpets blew, and the people shouted. In a short time the woman got tired of being czarina, and she commanded that her husband should be found and brought to her presence. The palace was all in confusion, for who knew what had become of the old man? Officers and noblemen hurried here and there to search for him. At length he was found in a hut behind the palace. ""Listen, you old idiot!"" said his wife. ""Go to the golden fish, and tell it that I am tired of being czarina. I want to rule over all the ocean, to have dominion over every sea and all the fish."" The old man hesitated to go to the fish with such a request. ""Be off!"" said his wife, ""or your head shall be cut off."" The man went to the seashore and said: ""What do you want, old man?"" it asked. ""My old wife,"" answered he, ""is not satisfied even now. She says she will be czarina no longer, but will rule over all the waters and all the fish."" The fish made no reply, but dived down and disappeared in the sea. The man went back. What had become of the palace? He looked around, but could not see it. He rubbed his eyes in wonder. On the spot where the palace had stood was the old hut, and at the door stood the old woman in her old rags. So they commenced to live again in their old style. The man often went a-fishing, but he never more caught the golden fish.",Russia,"Source: Folk-Lore and Legends: Russian and Polish (London: W. W. Gibbings, 1890), pp. 35-41.",The Stonecutter (Japan).

The Fisherman and His Wife,0555,The Stonecutter,"Once upon a time there lived a stonecutter, who went every day to a great rock in the side of a big mountain and cut out slabs for gravestones or for houses. He understood very well the kinds of stones wanted for the different purposes, and as he was a careful workman he had plenty of customers. For a long time he was quite happy and contented, and asked for nothing better than what he had. Now in the mountain dwelt a spirit which now and then appeared to men, and helped them in many ways to become rich and prosperous. The stonecutter, however, had never seen this spirit, and only shook his head, with an unbelieving air, when anyone spoke of it. But a time was coming when he learned to change his opinion. One day the stonecutter carried a gravestone to the house of a rich man, and saw there all sorts of beautiful things, of which he had never even dreamed. Suddenly his daily work seemed to grow harder and heavier, and he said to himself: ""Oh, if only I were a rich man, and could sleep in a bed with silken curtains and golden tassels, how happy I should be!"" And a voice answered him: ""Your wish is heard; a rich man you shall be!"" At the sound of the voice the stonecutter looked around, but could see nobody. He thought it was all his fancy, and picked up his tools and went home, for he did not feel inclined to do any more work that day. But when he reached the little house where he lived, he stood still with amazement, for instead of his wooden hut was a stately palace filled with splendid furniture, and most splendid of all was the bed, in every respect like the one he had envied. He was nearly beside himself with joy, and in his new life the old one was soon forgotten. It was now the beginning of summer, and each day the sun blazed more fiercely. One morning the heat was so great that the stonecutter could scarcely breathe, and he determined he would stop at home till the evening. He was rather dull, for he had never learned how to amuse himself, and was peeping through the closed blinds to see what was going on in the street, when a little carriage passed by, drawn by servants dressed in blue and silver. In the carriage sat a prince, and over his head a golden umbrella was held, to protect him from the sun's rays. ""Oh, if I were only a prince!"" said the stonecutter to himself, as the carriage vanished around the corner. ""Oh, if I were only a prince, and could go in such a carriage and have a golden umbrella held over me, how happy I should be!"" And a prince he was. Before his carriage rode one company of men and another behind it; servants dressed in scarlet and gold bore him along, the coveted umbrella was held over his head, everything his heart could desire was his. But yet it was not enough. He looked around still for something to wish for, and when he saw that in spite of the water he poured on the grass the rays of the sun scorched it, and that in spite of the umbrella held over his head each day his face grew browner and browner, he cried in his anger: ""The sun is mightier than I; oh, if I were only the sun!"" And the mountain spirit answered: ""Your wish is heard; the sun you shall be."" And the sun he was, and felt himself proud in his power. He shot his beams above and below, on earth and in heaven; he burnt up the grass in the fields and scorched the faces of princes as well as of poorer folk. but in a short time he began to grow tired of his might, for there seemed nothing left for him to do. Discontent once more filled his soul, and when a cloud covered his face, and hid the earth from him, he cried in his anger: ""Does the cloud hold captive my rays, and is it mightier than I? Oh, that I were a cloud, and mightier than any!"" And the mountain spirit answered: ""Your wish is heard; a cloud you shall be!"" And a cloud he was, and lay between the sun and the earth. He caught the sun's beams and held them, and to his joy the earth grew green again and flowers blossomed. But that was not enough for him, and for days and week he poured forth rain till the rivers overflowed their banks, and the crops of rice stood in water. Towns and villages were destroyed by the power of the rain, only the great rock on the mountainside remained unmoved. The cloud was amazed at the sight, and cried in wonder: ""Is the rock, then, mightier than I? Oh, if I were only the rock!"" And the mountain spirit answered; ""Your wish is heard; the rock you shall be!"" And the rock he was, and gloried in his power. Proudly he stood, and neither the heat of the sun nor the force of the rain could move him. ""This is better than all!"" he said to himself. But one day he heard a strange noise at his feet, and when he looked down to see what it could be, he saw a stonecutter driving tools into his surface. Even while he looked a trembling feeling ran all through him, and a great block broke off and fell upon the ground. Then he cried in his wrath: ""Is a mere child of earth mightier than a rock? Oh, if I were only a man!"" And the mountain spirit answered: ""Your wish is heard. A man once more you shall be!"" And a man he was, and in the sweat of his brow he toiled again at his trade of stone cutting. His bed was hard and his food scanty, but he had learned to be satisfied with it, and did not long to be something or somebody else. And as he never asked for things he did not have, or desired to be greater and mightier than other people, he was happy at last, and never again heard the voice of the mountain spirit.",Japan,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Crimson Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1903), pp. 192-97.","The Bullock's Balls (India).

The Flying Dutchman,0777,The Fable of the Flying Dutchman,"That wooden ghost, that spook-ship, is so called from the captain, a Dutchman, who once swore by all the devils that he would get round a certain mountain -- its name has escaped me -- in spite of a fearful storm, even if he would have to sail until Judgment Day. The devil took him at his word, therefore he must sail forever, until set free by a woman's loyalty. The devil, in his stupidity, has no faith in female loyalty, and allowed the enchanted captain to land once in seven years and get married, and thus find opportunities to save his soul. The poor Dutchman! He often has been only too glad to escape from his marriage and his wife-savior, and get on board again. The play which I saw in Amsterdam [in the year 1827] was based on this fable. Another seven years have passed; the poor Dutchman is more weary than ever of his endless wandering; he comes ashore, befriends a Scottish nobleman, to whom he sells diamonds at an unbelievably low price, and when he hears that his customer has a beautiful daughter, he asks for her hand in marriage. This bargain is agreed to as well. Next we see the Scotsman's home; with an anxious heart the maiden awaits the bridegroom. With melancholy she often looks up at a large, time-worn picture which hangs in the hall, and depicts a handsome man in Spanish-Dutch clothing. It is an old heirloom, and according to her grandmother, it is a true portrait of the Flying Dutchman as he was seen in Scotland a hundred years earlier, in the time of William of Orange. A warning connected to this portrait has been passed down as well: that the women of the family must beware of the person depicted in the painting. This warning has naturally enough had the result of deeply impressing the features of the dangerous man in the picture in the girl's mind, from her childhood onward. Therefore, when the authentic Flying Dutchman makes his appearance, she is startled, but not from fear. He too is moved when he sees the portrait. But when he is told who it represents, he tactfully turns aside all suspicion, makes fun of the superstition, and ridicules the Flying Dutchman, the Wandering Jew of the Ocean. Nevertheless, now in a melancholy mood, he relates how the gentleman must be suffering horribly out there on the endless waves, how his body is nothing other than a coffin of flesh in which is soul in imprisoned, how life and death alike reject him, like an empty cask scornfully cast ashore by the sea, then contemptuously again set adrift. He further muses that the poor Dutchman's agony must be as deep as the sea on which he sails -- cast between life and death, his ship without anchor, and his heart without hope. I believe that these were, more or less, the words with which the bridegroom ends. The bride looks at him earnestly, now and then casting glances at his portrait. It seems seems that she has guessed his secret; and when he afterwards asks, ""Katherine, will you be true to me?"" she answers with resolve, ""True to death."" She cries aloud, ""I was true to you to this hour, and I know how to be true unto death! Saying this she throws herself into the waves, and the enchantment is ended. The Flying Dutchman is redeemed, and we see the ghostly ship slowly sink into the depths of the sea.","Heinrich Heine, The Memoirs of Herr von Schnabelewopski, 1833 You certainly know the fable of the Flying Dutchman. It is the story of an enchanted ship which can never arrive in port, and which since time immemorial has been sailing about at sea. When it meets a vessel, some of the unearthly sailors come in a boat and beg the others to take a packet of letters home for them. These letters must be nailed to the mast, else some misfortune will happen to the ship -- above all if no Bible be on board, and no horseshoe nailed to the foremast. The letters are always addressed to people whom no one knows, and who have long been dead, so that some late descendant gets a letter addressed to a far away great-great-grandmother, who has slept for centuries in her grave.","Source: The Memoirs of Herr von Schnabelewopski, ch. 7, The Works of Heinrich Heine, translated from the german by Charles Godfrey Leland (Hans Breitmann), vol. 1 (London: William Heinemann, 1903), pp. 130-36.",Link to the German-language original: Die Fabel von dem fliegenden Holländer.

The Flying Dutchman,0777,The Story of the Flying Dutchman,"Nothing could do away the idea of this phenomenon on the minds of the sailors; and, on their relating the circumstances when they arrived in port, the story spread like wildfire, and the supposed phantom was called the Flying Dutchman. From the Dutch the English seamen got the infatuation, and there are very few Indiamen, but what has someone on board, who pretends to have seen the apparition. About two in the morning I was waked by a violent shake by the shoulder, when, starting up in my hammock, I saw the boatswain, with evident signs of terror and dismay in his countenance, standing by me. ""For God's sake, messmate,"" said he, ""hand us the key of the case, for by the Lord I'm damnably scarified; for, d'ye see, I was just looking over the weather bow, what should I see but the Flying Dutchman coming right down upon us, with everything set -- I know 'twas she -- I cou'd see all her lower-deck ports up, and the lights fore and aft, as if cleared for action. Now as how, d'ye see, I am sure no mortal ship could bear her lower-deck ports up and pot founder in this here weather. Why, the sea runs mountains high. It must certainly be the ghost of that there Dutchman, that foundered in this latitude, and which, I have heard say, always appears in this here quarter, in hard gales of wind."" After taking a good pull or two at the Holland's [a bottle], he grew a little composed, when I jokingly asked him if he was afraid of ghosts? ""Why, as to that, d'ye see,"" said he, ""I think as how I'm as good as another man; but I'd always a terrible antipathy to those things. Even when I was a boy, I never could find it in my heart to cross a churchyard in the dark without whistling and hallooing, to make them believe I had company with me, for I've heard say they appear but to one at a time; for now, when I called to Joe Jackson, who was at the helm, to look over the weather bow, he saw nothing; tho', ask how, I saw it as plain as this here bottle,"" taking another swig at the Geneva. Having some curiosity to see if I could make out anything that could take such an appearance, I turned out, and accompanied him upon deck; but it had cleared up, the moon shining very bright, and not a cloud to be seen; though, by what I could learn from the rest of the people who were on deck, it had been very cloudy about half an hour before, of course I easily divined what kind of phantom had so alarmed my messmate.",A Voyage to New South Wales (1795),"Source: George Barrington, A Voyage to New South Wales (London, 1795), pp. 45-47.",NA,NA
The Flying Dutchman,0777,Vanderdecken's Message Home,"At two p.m. we had a squall, accompanied by thunder and rain. The seamen, growing restless, looked anxiously ahead. They said we would have a dirty night of it, and that it would not be worth while to turn into their hammocks. As the second mate was describing a gale he had encountered off Cape Race, Newfoundland, we were suddenly taken all aback, and the blast came upon us furiously. We continued to scud under a double reefed mainsail and foretopsail till dusk; but, as the sea ran high, the captain thought it safest to bring her to. The watch on deck consisted of four men, one of whom was appointed to keep a lookout ahead, for the weather was so hazy, that we could not see two cables' length from the bows. This man, whose name was Tom Willis, went frequently to the bows, as if to observe something; and when the others called to him, inquiring what he was looking at, he would give no definite answer. They therefore went also to the bows, and appeared startled, and at first said nothing. But presently one of them cried, ""William, go call the watch."" The seamen, having been asleep in their hammocks, murmured at this unseasonable summons, and called to know how it looked upon deck. To which Tom Willis replied, ""Come up and see. What we are minding is not on deck, but ahead."" On hearing this, they ran up without putting on their jackets, and when they came to the bows there was a whispering. One of them asked, ""Where is she? I do not see her."" To which another replied, ""The last flash of lightning showed there was not a reef in one of her sails; but we, who know her history, know that all her canvass will never carry her into port."" By this time, the talking of the seamen had brought some of the passengers on deck. They could see nothing, however, for the ship was surrounded by thick darkness, and by the noise of the dashing waters, and the seamen evaded the questions that were put to them. At this juncture the chaplain came on deck. He was a man of grave and modest demeanor, and was much liked among the seamen, who called him Gentle George. He overheard one of the men asking another, if he had ever seen the Flying Dutchman before, and if he knew the story about her. To which the other replied, ""I have heard of her beating about in these seas. What is the reason she never reaches port?"" The first speaker replied, ""They give different reasons for it, but my story is this: She was an Amsterdam vessel, and sailed from that port seventy years ago. Her master's name was Vanderdecken. He was a staunch seaman, and would have his own way, in spite of the devil. For all that, never a sailor under him had reason to complain; though how it is on board with them now, nobody knows. The story is this, that in doubling the Cape, they were a long day trying to weather the Table Bay, which we saw this morning. However, the wind headed them, and went against them more and more, and Vanderdecken walked the deck, swearing at the wind. Just after sunset, a vessel spoke him, asking if he did not mean to go into the Bay that night. Vanderdecken replied, 'May I be eternally d__d if I do, though I should beat about here till the day of judgment!' And to be sure, Vanderdecken never did go into that bay; for it is believed that he continues to beat about in these seas still, and will do so long enough. This vessel is never seen but with foul weather along with her."" To which another replied, ""We must keep clear of her. They say that her captain mans his jolly boat, when a vessel comes in sight, and tries hard to get alongside, to put letters on board, but no good comes to them who have communication with him."" Tom Willis said, ""There is such a sea between us at present, as should keep us safe from such visits."" To which the other answered, ""We cannot trust to that, if Vanderdeckcn sends out his men."" Some of this conversation having been overheard by the passengers, there was a commotion among them. In the meantime, the noise of the waves against the vessel, could scarcely be distinguished from the sounds of the distant thunder. The wind had extinguished the light in the binnacle, where the compass was, and no one could tell which way the ship's head lay. The passengers were afraid to ask questions, lest they should augment the secret sensation of fear which chilled every heart, or learn any more than they already knew. For while they attributed their agitation of mind to the state of the weather, it was sufficiently perceptible that their alarms also arose from a cause which they did not acknowledge. The lamp at the binnacle being re-lighted, they perceived that the ship lay closer to the wind than she had hitherto done, and the spirits of the passengers were somewhat revived. Nevertheless, neither the tempestuous state of the atmosphere, nor the thunder had ceased; and soon a vivid flash of lightning showed the waves tumbling around us, and, in the distance, the Flying Dutchman scudding furiously before the wind, under a press of canvass. The sight was but momentary , but it was sufficient to remove doubt from the minds of the passengers. One of the men cried aloud, ""There she goes, top-gallants and all."" The chaplain had brought up his prayer book, in order that he might draw from thence something to fortify and tranquillize the minds of the rest. Therefore, taking his seat near the binnacle, so that the light shone upon the white leaves of the book, he, in a solemn tone, read out the service for those distressed at sea. The sailors stood round with folded arms, and looked as if they thought it would be of little use. But this served to occupy the attention of those on deck for a while. In the meantime, the flashes of lightning becoming less vivid, showed nothing else, far or near, but the billows weltering round the vessel. The sailors seemed to think that they had not yet seen the worst, but confined their remarks and prognostications to their own circle. At this time, the captain, who had hitherto remained in his birth, came on deck, and, with a gay and unconcerned air, inquired what was the cause of the general dread. He said he thought they had already seen the worst of the weather, and wondered that his men had raised such a hubbub about a capful of wind. Mention being made of the Flying Dutchman, the captain laughed. He said he would like very much to see any vessel carrying top-gallant-sails in such a night, for it would be a sight worth looking at. The chaplain, taking him by one of the buttons of his coat, drew him aside, and appeared to enter into serious conversation with him. While they were talking together the captain was heard to say, ""Let us look to our own ship, and not mind such things,"" and accordingly, he sent a man aloft, to see if all was right about the foretop-sail yard, which was chafing the mast wit a loud noise. It was Tom Willis who went up; and when he came down, he said that all was tight, and that he hoped it would soon get clearer; and that they would see no more of what they were most afraid of. The captain and first mate were heard laughing loudly together, while the chaplain observed, that it would be better to repress such unseasonable gaiety. The second mate, a native of Scotland, whose name was Duncan Saunderson, having attended one of the university classes at Aberdeen, thought himself too wise to believe all that the sailors said, and took part with the captain. He jestingly told Tom Willis, to borrow his grandam's spectacles the next time he was sent to keep a lookout ahead. Tom walked sulkily away, muttering, that he would nevertheless trust to his own eyes till morning, and accordingly took his station at the bow, and appeared to watch as attentively as before. The sound of talking soon ceased, for many returned to their births, and we heard nothing but the clanking of the ropes upon the masts, and the bursting of the billows ahead, as the vessel successively took the seas. But after a considerable interval of darkness, gleams of lightning began to reappear. Tom Willis suddenly called out, ""Vanderdecken, again! Vanderdecken, again! I see, them letting down a boat."" All who were on deck ran to the bows. The next flash of lightning shone far and wide over the raging sea, and showed us not only the Flying Dutchman at a distance, but also a boat coming from her with four men. The boat was within two cables' length of our ship's side. The man who first saw her, ran to the captain, and asked whether they should hail her or not. The captain, walking about in great agitation, made no reply. The first mate cried, ""Who's going to heave a rope to that boat?"" The men looked at each other without offering to do anything. The boat had come very near the chains, when Tom Willis called out, ""What do you want, or what devil has blown you here in such weather?"" A piercing voice from the boat replied in English, ""We want to speak with your captain."" The captain took no notice of this, and Vanderdecken's boot having come close alongside, one of the men came upon deck, and appeared like a fatigued and weather-beaten seaman, holding some letters in his hand. Our sailors all drew back. The chaplain, however, looking steadfastly upon him, went forward a few steps, and asked, ""What is the purpose of this visit?"" The stranger replied, ""We have long been kept here by foul weather, and Vanderdecken wishes to send these letters to his friends in Europe."" Our captain now came forward, and said as firmly as he could, ""I wish Vanderdecken would put his letters on board of any other vessel rather than mine."" The stranger replied, ""We have tried many a ship, but most of them refuse our letters."" Upon which, Tom Willis muttered, ""It will be best for us if we do the same, for they say, there is sometimes a sinking weight in your paper."" The stranger took no notice of this, but asked where we were from. On being told that we were from Portsmouth, he said, as if with strong feeling, ""Would that you had rather been from Amsterdam. Oh that we saw it again! -- We must see our friends again."" When he uttered these words, the men who were in the boat below, wrung their hands, and cried in a piercing tone, in Dutch, ""Oh that we saw it again! We have been long here beating about; but we must see our friends again."" The chaplain asked the stranger, ""How long have you been at sea?"" He replied, ""We have lost our count; for our almanac was blown overboard. Our ship, you see, is there still; so why should you ask how long we have been at sea? for Vanderdecken only wishes to write home and comfort his friends."" To which the chaplain replied, ""Your letters, I fear, would be of no use in Amsterdam, even if they were delivered, for the persons to whom they are addressed are probably no longer to be found there, except under very ancient green turf in the churchyard."" The unwelcome stranger then wrung his hands, and appeared to weep; and replied, ""It is impossible. We cannot believe you. We have been long driving about here, but country nor relations cannot be so easily forgotten. There is not a raindrop in the air but feels itself kindred to all the rest, and they fall back into the sea to meet with each other again. How then, can kindred blood be made to forget where it came from? Even our bodies are part of the ground of Holland; and Vanderdecken says, if he once were come to Amsterdam, he would rather be changed into a stone post, well fixed into the ground, than leave it again; if that were to die elsewhere. But in the meantime, we only ask you to take these letters."" The chaplain, looking at him with astonishment, said, ""This is the insanity of natural affection, which rebels against all measures of time and distance."" The stranger continued, ""Here is a letter from our second mate, to his dear and only remaining friend, his uncle, the merchant who lives in the second house on Stuncken Yacht Quay."" He held forth the letter, but no one would approach to take it. Tom Willis raised his voice, and said, ""One of our men here says that he was in Amsterdam last summer, and he knows for certain, that the street called Stuncken Yacht Quay, was pulled down sixty years ago, and now there is only a large church at that place."" The man from the Flying Dutchman, said, ""It is impossible; we cannot believe you. Here is another letter from myself, in which I have sent a banknote to my dear sister, to buy some gallant lace, to make her a high headdress."" Tom Willis hearing this, said, ""It is most likely that her head now lies under a tombstone, which will outlast all the changes of the fashion. But on what house is your banknote?"" The stranger replied, ""On the house of Vanderbrucker and Company."" The man, of whom Tom Willis had spoken, said, ""I guess there will now be some discount upon it, for that banking house was gone to destruction forty years ago; and Vanderbrucker was afterwards a-missing. -- But to remember these things is like raking up the bottom of an old canal."" The stranger called out passionately, ""It is impossible. We cannot believe it! It is cruel to say such things to people in our condition. There is a letter from our captain himself, to his much-beloved and faithful wife, whom he left at a pleasant summer dwelling, on the border of the Haarlemer Mer. She promised to have the house beautifully painted and gilded before he came back, and to get a new set of looking-glasses for the principal chamber, that she might see as many images of Vanderdecken, as if she had six husbands at once."" The man replied, ""There has been time enough for her to have had six husbands since then; but were she alive still, there is no fear that Vanderdecken would ever get home to disturb her."" On hearing this the stranger again shed tears, and said, if they would not take the letters, he would leave them; and looking around he offered the parcel to the captain, chaplain, and to the rest of the crew successively, but each drew back as it was offered, and put his hands behind his back. He then laid the letters upon the deck, and placed upon them a piece of iron, which was lying near, to prevent them from being blown away. Having done this, he swung himself over the gangway, and went into the boat. We heard the others speak to him, but the rise of a sudden squall prevented us from distinguishing his reply. The boat was seen to quit the ship's side, and, in a few moments, there were no more traces of her than if she had never been there. The sailors rubbed their eyes, as if doubting what they had witnessed, but the parcel still lay upon deck, and proved the reality of all that had passed. Duncan Saunderson, the Scotch mate, asked the captain if he should take them up, and put them in the letter bag. Receiving no reply, he would have lifted them if it had not been for Tom Willis, who pulled him back, saying that nobody should touch them. In the meantime the captain went down to the cabin, and the chaplain having followed him, found him at his bottle-case, pouring out a large dram of brandy. The captain, although somewhat disconcerted, immediately offered the glass to him, saying, ""Here, Charters, is what is good in a cold night."" The chaplain declined drinking anything, and the captain having swallowed the bumper, they both returned to the deck, where they found the seamen giving their opinions concerning what should be done with the letters. Tom Willis proposed to pick them up on a harpoon and throw it overboard. Another speaker said, ""I have always heard it asserted that it is neither safe to accept them voluntarily, nor when they are left to throw them out of the ship."" ""Let no one touch them,"" said the carpenter. ""The way to do with the letters from the Flying Dutchman is to case them upon deck, by nailing boards over them, so that if he sends back for them, they are still there to give him."" The carpenter went to fetch his tools. During his absence, the ship gave so violent a pitch, that the piece of iron slid off the letters, and they were whirled overboard by the wind, like birds of evil omen whirring through the air. There was a cry of joy among the sailors, and they ascribed the favorable change which soon took place in the weather, to our having got quit of Vanderdecken. We soon got underway again. The night watch being set, the rest of the crew retired to their births.","Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 1821)","Source: ""Vanderdecken's Message Home; or, The Tenacity of Natural Affection,"" Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, vol. 9, no. 50 (May 1821), pp. 127-31.",NA,NA
The Foolish Friend,1586,Foolish Hans,"Once upon a time there was a poor peasant woman. She was a widow and had but one son. His name was Hans, and he was very stupid. It was summertime, and his mother gave him a large pot of honey, saying, ""I am sending you to town to sell this, but don't let people say too much to you."" She was afraid that people would bargain too much with him. Arriving in town, he cried out, ""Buy my honey!"" The people said, ""How much does it cost?"" He said, ""You are saying too much to me."" ""Can't we at least ask how much it costs?"" ""No,"" he said, ""you have already said too much,"" and he packed up and left town. Out in the country the flies and wasps swarmed around him, wanting his honey. ""Buy my honey!"" he said. They were not able to say anything to him, so he poured his honey out on the ground. ""You'll have to pay me in a week,"" he said. Then he went home and told his mother, ""I sold the honey and will get the money in a week."" A week later he again set off for town. Because of the money for the honey he took along a stout cudgel. He arrived at the spot, and there were still bees and flies there licking up the little honey that was left. He said, ""I want my money now,"" but they gave him nothing. ""I'll make short work of this,"" he said. ""I am reporting you to the judge."" He went to the judge, who asked, ""Just what do you want?"" ""The flies and wasps bought honey from me,"" he said, ""and now they refuse to pay."" The judge began to laugh, seeing that he was dealing with a real simpleton. ""All I can tell you, is that whenever you see a fly you should strike it dead,"" he answered. Just then a fly flew onto the judge's nose, and Hans hit the fly on his nose. ""Ouch, Jeez, my nose!"" cried the judge. Then Hans said, ""I was hitting at the fly, not at your nose."" Then the judge thought, ""He could kill someone if he sees a fly sitting on them. And who allowed it to happen? The judge, that's what people will say."" So he asked, ""How much did your honey cost?"" ""Three hundred florins,"" said Hans. So the judge wrote him a slip and sent him with it to the cashier, and when he received his money, he returned home.",Austria-Hungary,"Source: J. R.

The Foolish Friend,1586,Fortunio,"At last the servant, incensed at the boldness and persistency of the fly, rashly made trial to kill it when it was about to settle again on his master's temple and suck his blood. Simple fool that he was, he caught up a weighty bronze pestle, and, striking at the fly with all his might with the intent to kill it, he made an end of the grocer instead. As soon as Fortunio saw that he had slain his master and thereby made himself liable to death by the law, he took counsel with himself how he might best save his neck, and first resolved to seek safety in flight, but he afterwards fixed upon another scheme, which was to bury the corpse secretly. Therefore, having wrapped up the dead body of his master in a sack and carried it into a garden adjacent to the shop, he buried it there. This done he went to the sheepfold, and, having chosen a big old ram, he took it and threw it down the well. As the master did not appear at his usual hour in the evening the wife's suspicion fell upon Fortunio, and she questioned him as to her husband's whereabouts, but the fellow declared stoutly that he knew nothing of it. Then the good wife, overcome with grief, began to weep and to call for her husband aloud, but she called in vain. She went to her kinsfolk and told them her grief; whereupon they sought the governor of the city, and laid the crime to Fortunio's charge, demanding that he should be imprisoned and put to the question, in order to make him tell what had become of his master. The governor, having put the servant in hold and tied him to the rope, gave him the strappado as prescribed by law, on account of the charges against him. Handling of this sort was not to his taste, and he forthwith promised to tell all he knew, if they would let him down. So they brought him before the judge, and this was the cunning tale he had prepared for their befooling: ""Yesterday, O judge! when I was asleep near the well, I was awakened by a great noise, as of some mighty rock being hurled down into the water below. In my amazement I ran to the well and looked into it, but the water was quite clear and I could see nothing amiss; so I turned to go back to the house, when the same noise again met my ears. I am now quite sure in my mind that my master, when trying to draw some water up out of the well, fell down into it. Now, that the truth of the matter may be laid bare, I make petition that all now present may go to the spot; then I will descend into the well and disclose what I may find therein."" The judge was favorable to Fortunio's prayer, holding that experiment is the surest proof, and that no evidence can equal what is brought before one's eyes, and betook himself to the well, bidding the whole assembly follow. There went not only the worshipful persons who were about the judge, but also a vast crowd of the common people, who were curious to learn what might be the issue of the affair. Fortunio, obeying the commandment of the judge, went straightway down the well, and, when he had reached the bottom, made believe to be searching for his master's body in the water; but what he found was the carcass of the old ram which he himself had lately cast in. Feigning to be vastly amazed at this, the cunning fellow bawled up from the bottom of the well, ""O my mistress! Tell me whether your husband, my poor master, had horns or not; for I have alighted on somebody down here who has got an enormous pair, both long and large. Is it possible that he can be your husband?"" And when the good wife heard Fortunio's question she was so much overcome with shame that she could not find a word to say for herself. Meanwhile the bystanders waited, open-mouthed with curiosity, to set eyes on this corpse with horns, and to see whether it really was the body of the missing grocer or not; and when they saw hauled up Fortunio's old ram, they all clapped their hands, and were shaken by loud laughter. The judge, when he saw the issue of Fortunio's search, deemed that the foolish fellow was acting in good faith, and that he verily believed what he brought out of the well to be the remains of his master. On this account the judge let him go free, as innocent, but the grocer was never seen more, and the good wife, to her dying day, bore the shame anent the horns which Fortunio's cunning trick had cast upon her.","Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola","Source: Giovanni Francesco Straparola, The Facetious Nights night 13, tale 4, in: The Italian Novelists, vol. 4 (London: Privately printed for members of the Society of Bibliophiles, 1901), pp. 149-56.)","We know almost nothing about the personal life of Giovanni Francesco [also spelled Gianfrancesco] Straparola (ca. 1480 - ca. 1557).

The Foolish Friend,1586,Giufà and the Judge,"One day Giufà went out to gather herbs, and it was night before he returned. On his way back the moon rose through the clouds, and Giufà sat down on a stone and watched the moon appear and disappear behind the clouds, and he exclaimed constantly, ""It appears, it appears! It sets, it sets!"" Now there were near the way some thieves who were skinning a calf which they had stolen, and when they heard, ""It appears, it sets!"" they feared that the officers of justice were coming, so they ran away and left the meat. When Giufà saw the thieves running away, he went to see what it was and found the calf skinned. He took his knife and cut off flesh enough to fill his sack and went home. When he arrived there his mother asked him why he came so late. He said it was because he was bringing some meat which she was to sell the next day, and the money was to be kept for him. The next day his mother sent him into the country and sold the meat. In the evening Giufà returned and asked his mother, ""Did you sell the meat?"" ""Yes, I sold it to the flies on credit."" ""When will they give you the money?"" ""When they get it."" A week passed, and the flies brought no money, so Giufà went to the judge and said to him, ""Sir, I want justice. I sold the flies meat on credit, and they have not come to pay me."" The judge said, ""I pronounce this sentence on them: Wherever you see them, you may kill them."" Just then a fly lighted on the judge's nose, and Giufà dealt it such a blow that he broke the judge's head.",Italy,"Source: Thomas Frederick Crane, Italian Popular Tales (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1885), no. 100, p. 293.","Crane adds the following note: The anecdote of the fly in the latter part of the story is found independently in a version from Palermo: The flies plagued Giufà and stung him.

""You have my permission to kill them anywhere you find them."" In that moment the peasant saw a fly on the judge's cheek.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Bear and the Amateur of Gardening,"A certain mountain bruin once, they say, Was wont within a lonely wood to stray, A new Bellerophon secluded there, His mind had gone, and left his brain-pan bare. Reason on lonely people sheds no ray. It's good to speak -- better to silent stay: Both in excess are bad. No animal Was ever seen, or was within a call. Bear though he was, he wearied of this life, And longed for the world's joy and the world's strife. Then ""Melancholy marked him for her own."" Not far from him an old man lived alone. Dull as the bear, he loved his garden well; Was priest of Flora and Pomona; still, Though the employment's pleasant, a kind friend Is needfull, its full charms to it to lend. Gardens talk little, save in my small book. Weary at last of their mere smiling look, And those his dumb companions, one fine day, Our man set forth upon his lonely way, To seek a friend. The bear, with the same thought, Had left his mountain, satisfied with naught. By chance most strange the two adventurers meet At the same turning. He's afraid to greet The bear; but fly he can't. What can he do? Well, like a Gascon, he gets neatly through: Conceals his fright. The bear is not well bred; ""Here is my cottage; pray come in, my lord;"" Still growls, ""Come see me!"" but the other said, ""Do me the honor at my frugal board To lunch al fresco. I have milk and fruit, That will, perhaps, your worship's pleasure suit For once, though not your ordinary fare. I offer all I have."" With friendly air They're chums already before reaching home; Still better friends when there they've fairly come. In my opinion it's a golden rule: Better be lonely than be with a fool. The bear, who did not speak two words a day, Left the drudge there to work and toil away. Bruin went hunting, and brought in the game, Or flapped the blow-flies, when the blow-flies came; And kept from off his sleeping partner's face Of wingèd parasites the teasing race. One day a buzzer o'er the sleeping man Poised, and then settled on his nose -- their plan. The bear was crazy: all his chase was vain; ""I'll catch you, thief!"" he cried. It came again. 'Twas said, 'twas done: The flapper seized a stone, And launched it bravely -- bravely it was thrown. He crushed the fly, but smashed the poor man's skull -- A sturdy thrower, but a reasoner dull.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Foolish Friend,"A king, while visiting his wives' apartments, took a monkey from a neighboring stable for a pet. He kept him constantly close at hand for his amusement, for as it is said, parrots, partridges, doves, rams, monkeys, and such creatures are a king's natural companions. It goes without saying that the monkey, fed on the various dishes that the king gave him, grew large and was given respect by all who surrounded the king. Indeed, the king, due to his love and exceeding trust of the monkey, even gave him a sword to carry. In the vicinity of the palace the king had a grove artfully planted with many trees of various sorts. Early in the springtime the king noticed how beautiful the grove was. Its blossoms exuded a magnificent fragrance, while swarms of bees sang praise to the god of love. Thus overcome by love, he entered the grove with his favorite wife. He ordered all his servants to wait for him at the entrance. After having pleasantly strolling through and observing the grove, he grew tired and said to his monkey, ""I want to sleep a little while in this arbor of flowers. Take care that nothing disturbs me!"" Having said this, the king fell asleep. Presently a bee, pursuing the aroma of the flowers, betel, and musk, flew up and lit on his head. Seeing this, the monkey thought angrily, ""What is this? Am I to allow this common creature to bite the king before my very eyes?"" With that he proceeded to drive it away. However, in spite of the monkey's defense, the bee approached the king again and again. Finally, blinded by anger, the monkey drew his sword and struck down the bee with a single blow. However, the same blow also split the king's head. The queen, who was sleeping next to the king jumped up in terror. Seeing the crime, she said, ""Oh, oh, you foolish monkey! What have you done to the king who placed such trust in you?"" The monkey explained how it had happened, but thereafter he was shunned and scorned by everyone. Thus it is said, ""Do not choose a fool for a friend, for the king was killed by a monkey.""

India's most influential contribution to world literature, the Panchatantra (also spelled Pañcatantra or Pañca-tantra) consists of five books of animal fables and magic tales (some 87 stories in all) that were compiled, in their current form, between the third and fifth centuries AD. It is believed that even then the stories were already ancient. The tales' self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes the Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning ""court scholar.""

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Gardener and the Bear,"In the eastern part of Persia there lived at one time a gardener whose one joy in life was his flowers and fruit trees. He had neither wife, nor children, nor friends; nothing except his garden. At length, however, the good man wearied of having no one to talk to. He decided to go out into the world and find a friend. Scarcely was he outside the garden before he came face to face with a bear, who, like the gardener, was looking for a companion. Immediately a great friendship sprang up between these two. The gardener invited the bear to come into his garden, and fed him on quinces and melons. In return for this kindness, when the gardener lay down to take his afternoon nap, the bear stood by and drove off the flies. One afternoon it happened that an unusually large fly alighted on the gardener's nose. The bear drove it off, but it only flew to the gardener's chin. Again the bear drove it away, but in a few moments it was back once more on the gardener's nose. The bear now was filled with rage. With no thought beyond that of punishing the fly, he seized a huge stone, and hurled it with such force at the gardener's nose that he killed not only the fly, but the sleeping gardener.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Monkeys and the Dragonflies,"While she was fanning herself with her wings, a monkey approached her, and said, ""Aha! What are you doing here, wretched creature?"" ""O sir!

""I have been flying all morning, and I am so hot and tired that I can go no farther,"" she added. ""Indeed!"" exclaimed the monkey in a mocking tone. ""We don't allow any weak creature such as you are to stay under our shelter. Go away!"" he said angrily, and, taking a dry twig, he threw it at the poor creature. The dragonfly, being very quick, had flown away before the cruel monkey could hit her. She hurried to her brother the king, and told him what had happened. The king became very angry, and resolved to make war on the monkeys. So he dispatched three of his soldiers to the king of the monkeys with this challenge: Sir, As one of your subjects has treated my sister cruelly, I am resolved to kill you and your subjects with all speed. DRAGON The monkey king laughed at the challenge. He said to the messengers, ""Let your king and his soldiers come to the battlefield, and they will see how well my troops fight."" ""You don't mean what you say, cruel king,"" answered the messengers. ""You should not judge before the fight is over."" ""What fools, what fools!"" exclaimed the king of the monkeys. ""Go to your ruler and tell him my answer,"" and he drove the poor little creatures away. When the king of the dragonflies received the reply, he immediately ordered his soldiers to go to the battlefield, but without anything to fight with. Meanwhile the monkeys came, each armed with a heavy stick. Then the monkey king shouted, ""Strike the flying creatures with your clubs!"" When King Dragon heard this order, he commanded his soldiers to alight on the foreheads of their enemies. Then the monkeys began to strike at the dragonflies, which were on the foreheads of their companions. The dragonflies were very quick, and were not hurt at all; but the monkeys were all killed. Thus the light, quick-witted dragonflies won the victory over the strong but foolish monkeys. Return to D. L.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Mosquito and the Carpenter,"Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta gained his livelihood as a trader.

Said the carpenter to his son, who was seated hard by, ""My boy, there's a mosquito stinging me on the head. Do drive it away."" ""Hold still then father,"" said the son. ""One blow will settle it.""

""All right, father,"" answered the son, who was behind the old man's back, and, raising a sharp ax on high with intent to kill only the mosquito, he cleft his father's head in two.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Seven Crazy Fellows,"One morning Felipe asked his friends to go fishing. They stayed at the Cagayan River a long time. About two o'clock in the afternoon Mateo said to his companions, ""We are hungry; let us go home!"" ""Before we go,"" said Juan, ""let us count ourselves, to see that we are all here!"" He counted; but because he forgot to count himself, he found that they were only six, and said that one of them had been drowned. Thereupon they all dived into the river to look for their lost companion; and when they came out, Francisco counted to see if he had been found; but he, too, left himself out, so in they dived again. Jacinto said that they should not go home until they had found the one who was lost. While they were diving, an old man passed by. He asked the fools what they were diving for. They said that one of them had been drowned. ""How many were you at first?"" said the old man. They said that they were seven. ""All right,"" said the old man. ""Dive in, and I will count you."" They dived, and he found that they were seven. Since he had found their lost companion, he asked them to come with him. When they reached the old man's house, he selected Mateo and Francisco to look after his old wife; Eulalio he chose to be water carrier; Pedro, cook; Jacinto, wood carrier; and Juan and Felipe, his companions in hunting. When the next day came, the old man said that he was going hunting, and he told Juan and Felipe to bring along rice with them. In a little while they reached the mountains, and he told the two fools to cook the rice at ten o'clock. He then went up the mountain with his dogs to catch a deer. Now, his two companions, who had been left at the foot of the mountain, had never seen a deer. When Felipe saw a deer standing under a tree, he thought that the antlers of the deer were the branches of a small tree without leaves: so he hung his hat and bag of rice on them, but the deer immediately ran away. When the old man came back, he asked if the rice was ready. Felipe told him that he had hung his hat and the rice on a tree that ran away. The old man was angry, and said, ""That tree you saw was the antlers of a deer. We'll have to go home now, for we have nothing to eat."" Meanwhile the five crazy fellows who had been left at home were not idle. Eulalio went to get a pail of water. When he reached the well and saw his image in the water, he nodded, and the reflection nodded back at him. He did this over and over again; until finally, becoming tired, he jumped into the water, and was drowned. Jacinto was sent to gather small sticks, but he only destroyed the fence around the garden. Pedro cooked a chicken without removing the feathers. He also let the chicken burn until it was as black as coal. Mateo and Francisco tried to keep the flies off the face of their old mistress. They soon became tired, because the flies kept coming back; so they took big sticks to kill them with. When a fly lighted on the nose of the old woman, they struck at it so hard that they killed her. She died with seemingly a smile on her face. The two fools said to each other that the old woman was very much pleased that they had killed the fly. When the old man and his two companions reached home, the old man asked Pedro if there was any food to eat. Pedro said that it was in the pot. The old man looked in and saw the charred chicken and feathers. He was very angry at the cook. Then he went in to see his wife, and found her dead. He asked Mateo and Francisco what they had done to the old woman. They said that they had only been killing flies that tried to trouble her, and that she was very much pleased by their work. The next thing the crazy fellows had to do was to make a coffin for the dead woman; but they made it flat, and in such a way that there was nothing to prevent the corpse from falling off. The old man told them to carry the body to the church; but on their way they ran, and the body rolled off the flat coffin. They said to each other that running was a good thing, for it made their burden lighter. When the priest found that the corpse was missing, he told the six crazy fellows to go back and get the body. While they were walking toward the house, they saw an old woman picking up sticks by the roadside. ""Old woman, what are you doing here?"" they said. ""The priest wants to see you."" While they were binding her, she cried out to her husband, ""Ah! here are some bad boys trying to take me to the church."" But her husband said that the crazy fellows were only trying to tease her. When they reached the church with this old woman, the priest, who was also crazy, performed the burial ceremony over her. She cried out that she was alive; but the priest answered that since he had her burial fee, he did not care whether she was alive or not. So they buried this old woman in the ground.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Seven Wise Men of Buneyr,"Seven men of Buneyr once left their native wilds for the purpose of seeking their fortunes. When evening came they all sat down under a tree to rest, when one of them said, ""Let us count to see if we are all here."" So he counted, ""One, two, three, four, five, six,"" but, quite omitting to reckon himself, he exclaimed, ""There's one of us missing, we are only six!"" ""Nonsense!"" cried the others, and the whole company of seven began counting with uplifted forefingers, but they all forgot to count themselves. Fearing some evil, they now rose up, and at once set out to search for their missing comrade. Presently they met a shepherd, who greeted them civilly and said, ""Friends, why are you in such low spirits?"" ""We have lost one of our party,"" answered they; ""we started this morning seven in number, and now we are only six. Have you seen any one of us hereabouts?"" ""But,"" said the shepherd, ""seven you are, for I have found your lost companion; behold: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven!"" ""Ah,"" answered the wise men of Buneyr, ""you have indeed found our missing brother. We owe you a debt of gratitude. Because you have done us this service, we insist on doing a month's free labor for you."" So the shepherd, overjoyed with his good fortune, took the men home with him. Now, the shepherd's mother was a very old woman, in her dotage, utterly feeble and unable to help herself. When the morning came he placed her under the care of one of the Buneyris, saying to him, ""You will stay here and take care of my old mother."" To another Buneyri he said, ""You take out my goats, graze them on the hills by day, and watch over them by night."" To the other five he said, ""As for you, I shall have work for you tomorrow."" The man who was left in charge of the old crippled mother found that his time was fully occupied in the constant endeavor to drive off the innumerable flies which in that hot season kept her in a state of continual excitement and irritation. When, however, he saw that all his efforts were fruitless, and that he flapped the wretches away in vain, he became desperate, and, lifting up a large stone, he aimed it deliberately at a certain fly which had settled on the woman's face. Hurling it with all his might, he of course missed the fly, but, alas! he knocked the woman prone on her back. When the shepherd saw this he wrung his hands in despair. ""Ah,"" cried he, ""what has your stupidity done for me? The fly has escaped, but as for my poor old mother, you have killed her dead."" Meanwhile, the second Buneyri led his flock of goats up and down among the hills, and when midday came he rested to eat his bread, while many of the assembled goats lay down beside him. As he was eating he began to observe how the goats were chewing the cud and occasionally looking at him So he foolishly imagined that they were mocking him, and waxed wroth. ""So,"" cried he, ""because I am taking my food, you must needs crowd round and make game of me, must you?"" And, seizing his hatchet, he made a sudden rush at the poor animals, and he had already struck off the heads of several of them, when the shepherd came running to the spot, bemoaning his bad luck and crying to the fellow to desist from slaughter. That night was a sorrowful one for the trustful shepherd, and bitterly he repented his rashness. In the morning the remaining five wise men of Buneyr came to him, and said, ""It is now our turn. Give us some work to do, too!"" ""No, no, my friends,"" answered he; ""you have amply repaid me for the trifling favor I did for you in finding your missing companion; and now, for God's sake, go your way and let me see you no more."" Hearing these words, the wise men of Buneyr resumed their journey.",Pakistan,"Source: Charles Swynnerton, Indian Nights' Entertainment; or, Folk-Tales from the Upper Indus (London: Elliot.

Saying ,""Now then, this fly is biting mother's head again,"" he placed his mother's head gently on the ground. Then having gone and taken a rice pestle, and come back with it, he said, ""Is the fly still biting the head?"" and struck at the fly with the rice pestle, killing his mother with the blow. The boy's father having come, tried to arouse her. ""How is it that mother is dead?"" he asked. The boy said, ""A fly was biting our mother's head. I struck it with the rice pestle.

The Foolish Friend,1586,The Tale of a Butter Tub,"Once the carl and his old wife bought for themselves a barrel full of butter, which they intended to have for their household use during the winter, but now they were at a loss where to hide the barrel, that nobody should steal out of it. At last they agreed upon having it kept at the king's palace. They readily got the king to undertake the guarding of their tub, but its owner put it into its right place, and covered it as they thought fit. Now the autumn approached, and the old wife began to feel eager for some of the butter, and contrived at once a plan for getting her longing satisfied. One day, in fine weather, she was up early in the morning, and came in to her carl, saying she was called to the king's palace, to hold a child at baptism, wherefore she must go there. The carl said it was a matter of course. Now the old wife got ready in the greatest hurry and went to the king's palace. When she came there she said she should fetch a tiny slice of butter from the barrel. This everyone believed to be true, and she was let in to where the tub stood. Then the old woman took a great pat from the brim of the tub. After that she went home. Then asked the carl what had been the name of the child at the king's. The old woman answered, "" Brimmy is hight [named] the well-shaped girl."" When the old woman had finished what she had first taken of the butter, she said one morning to her husband, ""Eh! I am called yet once again to the king's."" ""Well, go then,"" said the carl. The old woman went away, and said at the king's as formerly, that she should fetch butter from the barrel. And this time, the old dame took butter away down to the middle of the tub. When she came home, the carl asked what was the name of the child. She answered, ""Middle, is called the little girl."" When the old wife had finished this provision of butter, she said to the old man : "" Yet, once more, am I called to the king's, to hold a child at baptism."" ""Go then,"" quoth the carl. The old wife went, and coming to the king's palace, said she came for butter. Now she took so much, that she could see the corner which the staves made with the bottom of the tub. When she came home, the carl asked her what was the name of the child. She answered. ""Logg [woodblock] is hight the ugly girl."" Now time passed till the old wife was, once more, in need of butter. Then she said to the old man, ""I am called for, once more, at the king's."" ""Go then,"" said the old man. The old woman went, and said, as formerly, that she had come for butter. This time, she took all that was left in the barrel. When she came home, the carl asked what was the name of the child. ""Bottom is hight the stubby swain,"" said the old woman. Time passed, till the later months of winter came on. Then the household provisions of the old man and woman began to be rather scarce. The old man said to his old wife, that it would be best to fetch the butter tub from the king's palace. To this, the old woman agreed. They came there and asked for their barrel. It was given to them, and they saw that the covering and everything about the barrel was quite in order. They rolled the barrel home, into the cottage. Now the carl opened the barrel, and lo! it was quite empty. He was rather startled at this, and asked his wife if she could tell the cause of it. She made believe to be no less astonished, and could find no reason for the trick they had been played. But, at the same moment, the old wife saw a big fly, which had got into the open barrel, and she said, ""Ah! There comes the wretched thief. Look here. This hateful fly has, doubtless, eaten all our butter from the tub."" This, the old man thought must be true, and ran off for the big hammer, with which he used to beat his dried fish, and would break the skull of the fly. He shut the door of the cottage, that the fly should not get out, and now chased the fly all over the place, knocking and beating at it, but never hitting save his own furniture and household chattels, which he broke to pieces. At last, the old man, being tired, sat down in fury and despair. But then the fly came and sat on his nose. Then the carl begged his wife to kill the fly, and said, ""Make haste, while it sits on the nose!"" (which since has passed into a common saying). The old woman lifted up, with all her might, the hammer, and thumped it on the old man's nose, and broke his skull so well that he was dead on the spot; but the fly escaped with unbroken skull. It is unscathed yet. But the old woman is still wailing over her carl.",Iceland,"Source: Jón Árnason, Icelandic Legends, series 2 (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1866), pp. 606-609.",The episode about the stolen butter is classified as a type 15 folktale.,NA
Foolish Wishes,0750a,Loppi and Lappi,"Every evening husband and wife sat next to the stove like two dried-up tree stumps, and often, for no reason at all, their bitterness spilled over, and they quarreled. As everyone knows, unfortunate people usually try to push their own guilt onto others, and even if they are not willfully evil, they blame others for their own bad luck. Thus Loppi often angrily said, ""If only I had had the good luck to marry a better woman, I would have lacked nothing. Today I could have been a wealthy man."" Lappi had an even quicker tongue, and for every one of her husband's words, she came back with a dozen of her own. ""Just look at you, you stupid lout! Of course it is partially my fault that in my child-like simplicity I did not know enough to choose a better husband, but there must have been witchcraft involved to make me turn to you. Only the devil knows what you secretly put into my food or drink. I had plenty of suitors, and if I had not settled for you, you miserable creature, today I could be a lady seated at a full table. It is your fault, you worthless man, that I'll be suffering from hunger and sorrow until I die. And it is also your fault that all our children have died, because you did not know how to take care of a wife and children."" This stream of words gushed forth, not ceasing until the husband stopped her mouth with his fist. One evening the couple were again quarrelling in their hut when a stately woman dressed in clothes of German cut stepped inside. Her appearance brought the wife's tongue to a standstill, and caused the husband to lower his raised arm. After a friendly greeting, the strange woman said, ""You are poor wretches and until now have suffered much. However, three days from now your misery will suddenly end. Therefore keep peace in your house, and decide what destiny you would best choose for yourselves. I am not a human, as I appear to you, but rather a higher being who, through God's power, can cause wishes to be fulfilled. You have three days' time for consideration, and then you may state three wishes that you desire. Say your wishes aloud, and in the same instant they will come true through magic power. But be careful not to wish for unnecessary things."" Following these words, the stately woman greeting them once again, then disappeared out the door in a flash. Loppi and Lappi, who had now forgotten their quarrel, stared speechlessly out the door through which the miraculous vision had entered and disappeared. Finally the husband said, ""Let's go to bed now. We have three days to think about this. We want to use these wishes wisely, so we can get the best luck for ourselves."" Although they had three days for consideration, they spent more than half the night burdened with thoughts of which wish would be the very best. Oh, what precious freedom ruled in the hut without interruption for the next three days! Loppi and Lappi had become different people. They spoke together friendlily, and looked after one another's needs. They spent the greatest part of each day sitting quietly in the corner thinking about what they should wish for. On the third day Loppi went into the village, where that morning a swine had been slaughtered, and the sausage kettle must just now be standing on the fire. He took with him the butter pot, with its lid, wanting to ask his neighbor's wife for sausage water to cook his cabbage in that evening. Loppi felt that they would be able to think better if their stomachs were filled with good food. Arriving home he put the cabbage on the fire so their meal would be ready at the right time. Evening arrived, and with it the time when they could make their wishes. The pot of cabbage soup was steaming on the table, and husband and wife sat down to eat. Now they could have their wishes fulfilled. They had already eaten several spoonfuls of the tasty soup when Lappi said, contentedly, ""Thanks be to God for this good soup. It will fill us up nicely, but it would taste even better if we only had a sausage to go with it!"" Bang! A large sausage fell from above onto the middle of the table. For a while husband and wife were so startled that it did not occur to them to eat the sausage. Loppi remarked that with the sausage their first wish had been fulfilled, and that so angered him that he shouted, ""May the Evil One grab you and stick this sausage onto your nose! If...."" But the poor man was too frightened to continue speaking, for the sausage was already hanging from Lappi's nose, not like a normal sausage, but like a piece of flesh growing out of the nose. What could they do now? Two wishes had already been wasted, and the second one had so misshapen the woman that she would not dare to be seen by other people. They still had one wish that had not been stated, and with this one they could set everything right. At this moment poor Lappi had no other desire than to free herself from the long sausage, so she said this wish aloud, and the sausage disappeared. Now all three wishes were gone, and Loppi and Lappi had to continue living poorly in their hut. For some time afterward they expected the beautiful woman to return, but the stranger never appeared again. Whoever fails to take immediate advantage of unexpected luck will lose it forever.",Estonia,"Source: Friedrich Kreutzwald, ""Loppi und Lappi,"" Estnische Märchen, vol. 2 (Dorpat: Verlag von C.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Ridiculous Wishes,"One day while at his work he was again lamenting his fate. ""Some men,"" he said, ""have only to make known their desires, and straightway these are granted, and their every wish fulfilled; but it has availed me little to wish for ought, for the gods are deaf to the prayers of such as I."" As he spoke these words there was a great noise of thunder, and Jupiter appeared before him wielding his mighty thunderbolts. Our poor man was stricken with fear and threw himself on the ground. ""My lord,"" he said, ""forget my foolish speech; heed not my wishes, but cease thy thundering!"" ""Have no fear,"" answered Jupiter; ""I have heard thy plaint, and have come hither to show thee how greatly thou dost wrong me. Hark! I, who am sovereign lord of this world, promise to grant in full the first three wishes which it will please thee to utter, whatever these may be. Consider well what things can bring thee joy and prosperity, and as thy happiness is at stake, be not over-hasty, but revolve the matter in thy mind."" Having thus spoken Jupiter withdrew himself and made his ascent to Olympus. As for our woodcutter, he blithely corded his faggot, and throwing it over his shoulder, made for his home. To one so light of heart the load also seemed light, and his thoughts were merry as he strode along. Many a wish came into his mind, but he was resolved to seek the advice of his wife, who was a young woman of good understanding. He had soon reached his cottage, and casting down his faggot: ""Behold me, Fanny,"" he said. ""Make up the fire and spread the board, and let there be no stint. We are wealthy, Fanny, wealthy for evermore; we have only to wish for whatsoever we may desire."" Thereupon he told her the story of what had befallen that day. Fanny, whose mind was quick and active, immediately conceived many plans for the advancement of their fortune, but she approved her husband's resolve to act with prudence and circumspection. ""'Twere a pity,"" she said, ""to spoil our chances through impatience. We had best take counsel of the night, and wish no wishes until tomorrow."" ""That is well spoken,"" answered Harry. ""Meanwhile fetch a bottle of our best, and we shall drink to our good fortune."" Fanny brought a bottle from the store behind the faggots, and our man enjoyed his ease, leaning back in his chair with his toes to the fire and his goblet in his hand. ""What fine glowing embers!"" he said, ""and what a fine toasting fire! I wish we had a black pudding at hand."" Hardly had he spoken these words when his wife beheld, to her great astonishment, a long black pudding which, issuing from a corner of the hearth, came winding and wriggling towards her. She uttered a cry of fear, and then again exclaimed in dismay, when she perceived that this strange occurrence was due to the wish which her husband had so rashly and foolishly spoken. Turning upon him, in her anger and disappointment she called the poor man all the abusive names that she could think of. ""What!"" she said to him, ""when you can call for a kingdom, for gold, pearls, rubies, diamonds, for princely garments and wealth untold, is this the time to set your mind upon black puddings!"" ""Nay!"" answered the man, ""'twas a thoughtless speech, and a sad mistake; but I shall now be on my guard, and shall do better next time."" ""Who knows that you will?"" returned his wife. ""Once a witless fool, always a witless fool!"" and giving free rein to her vexation and ill-temper she continued to upbraid her husband until his anger also was stirred, and he had wellnigh made a second bid and wished himself a widower. ""Enough! woman,"" he cried at last; ""put a check upon thy froward tongue! Who ever heard such impertinence as this! A plague on the shrew and on her pudding! Would to heaven it hung at the end of her nose!"" No sooner had the husband given voice to these words than the wish was straightway granted, and the long coil of black pudding appeared grafted to the angry dame's nose. Our man paused when he beheld what he had wrought. Fanny was a comely young woman, and blest with good looks, and truth to tell, this new ornament did not set off her beauty. Yet it offered one advantage, that as it hung right before her mouth, it would thus effectively curb her speech. So, having now but one wish left, he had all but resolved to make good use of it without further delay, and, before any other mischance could befall, to wish himself a kingdom of his own. He was about to speak the word, when he was stayed by a sudden thought. ""It is true,"" he said to himself, ""that there is none so great as a king, but what of the queen that must share his dignity? With what grace would she sit beside me on the throne with a yard of black pudding for a nose?"" In this dilemma he resolved to put the case to Fanny, and to leave her to decide whether she would rather be a queen, with this most horrible appendage marring her good looks, or remain a peasant wife, but with her shapely nose relieved of this untoward addition. Fanny's mind was soon made up: Although she had dreamt of a crown and sceptre, yet a woman's first wish is always to please. To this great desire all else must yield, and Fanny would rather be fair in drugget than be a queen with an ugly face. Thus our woodcutter did not change his state, did not become a potentate, nor fill his purse with golden crowns. He was thankful enough to use his remaining wish to a more humble purpose, and forthwith relieved his wife of her encumbrance.",Charles Perrault,NA,"Source: Charles Perrault, The Fairy Tales of Charles Perrault, (London: George G.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Sausage,"There was once an old woman, who was all alone one evening in her cottage, occupied with her household affairs. While she was waiting for her husband, who was away at work over in the forest, and while she was bustling about, a fine, grand lady came in, and so the woman began to curtsy and curtsy, for she had never seen such a grand person before. ""I should be so much obliged if you would lend me your brewing pan,"" said the lady, ""for my daughter is going to be married, and I expect guests from all parts."" Oh, dear, yes! That she might have, said the woman, although she could not remember whether she had ever seen her before, and so she went to fetch the pan. The lady took it, and thanked the woman, saying that she would pay her well for the loan of it, and so she went her way. Two days afterwards the lady came back with it, and this time she also found the woman alone. ""Many thanks for the loan,"" said the lady. ""and now in return you shall have three wishes."" And with this the lady left, and vanished so quickly that the old woman had not even time to ask her name or where she lived. But that did not matter, she thought, for now she had three wishes, and she began to think what she should wish for. She expected her husband back soon, and she thought it would be best to wait until he came home and could have a say in the matter. But the least they could wish for must be a fine big farm -- the best in the parish, and a box full of money, and just fancy how happy and comfortable they would be then, for they had worked so hard all their days! Ah, yes, then the neighbors would have something to wonder at, for you may guess how they would stare at all the fine things she would have. But since they were now so rich it was really a shame that there should be nothing but some blue, sour milk and some hard crusts of bread in the cupboard for her husband when he came home tired and weary, he who was fond of hot food. She had just been to her neighbor's and there she had seen a fine big sausage, which they were going to have for supper. ""Ah, deary me, I wish I had that sausage here!"" sighed the old woman; and the next moment a big sausage lay on the table right before her. She was just going to put it in the pan when her husband came in. ""Father, father!"" cried the woman, ""it's all over with our troubles and hard work now. I lent my brewing pan to a fine lady, and when she brought it back she promised we should have three wishes. And now you must help me to wish for something really good, for you're so clever at hitting upon the right thing -- and it's all true, for just look at the sausage, which I got the moment I wished for it!"" ""What do you mean, you silly old woman?"" shouted the husband, who became angry. ""Have you been wishing for such a paltry thing as a sausage, when you might have had anything you liked in the world? I wish the sausage were sticking to your nose, since you haven't any better sense."" All at once the woman gave a cry, for sure enough there was the sausage sticking to her nose; and she began tearing and pulling away at it, but the more she pulled the firmer it seemed to stick. She was not able to get it off. ""Oh, dear! oh, dear!"" sobbed the woman. ""You don't seem to have any more sense than I, since you can wish me such ill luck. I only wanted something nice for you, and then -- , oh dear! oh, dear!"" and the old woman went on crying and sobbing. The husband tried, of course, to help his wife to get rid of the sausage; but for all he pulled and tugged away at it he did not succeed, and he was nearly pulling his wife's head off her body. But they had one wish left, and what were they now to wish? Yes, what were they to wish? They might, of course, wish for something very fine and grand; but what could they do with all the finery in the world, as long as the mistress of the house had a long sausage sticking to the end of her nose? She would never be able to show herself anywhere! ""You wish for something,"" said the woman in the midst of her crying. ""No, you wish,"" said the husband, who also began crying when he saw the state his wife was in, and saw the terrible sausage hanging down her face. So he thought he would make the best use he could of the last wish, and said, ""I wish my wife was rid of that sausage."" And the next moment it was gone! They both became so glad that they jumped up and danced around the room in great glee -- for you must know that although a sausage may be ever so nice when you have it in your mouth, it is quite a different thing to have one sticking to your nose all your life.",Sweden,"Source: Gabriel Djurklou, Fairy Tales from the Swedish , translated by H.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Three Wishes,"A certain man had longed all his life to look upon the Night of Power, and one night it befell that he gazed at the sky and saw the angels, and Heaven's gates thrown open; and he beheld all things prostrating themselves before their Lord, each in its several stead. So he said to his wife, ""Harkye, such an one, verily Allah hath shown me the Night of Power, and it hath been proclaimed to me, from the invisible world, that three prayers will be granted unto me; so I consult thee for counsel as to what shall I ask."" Quoth she, ""Oh man, the perfection of man and his delight is in his prickle; therefore do thou pray Allah to greaten thy yard and magnify it."" So he lifted up his hands to heaven and said, ""Oh Allah, greaten my yard and magnify it."" Hardly had he spoken when his tool became as big as a column and he could neither sit nor stand nor move about nor even stir from his stead; and when he would have carnally known his wife, she fled before him from place to place. So he said to her, ""Oh accursed woman, what is to be done? This is thy list, by reason of thy lust."" She replied, ""No, by Allah, I did not ask for this length and huge bulk, for which the gate of a street were too strait. Pray Heaven to make it less."" So he raised his eyes to Heaven and said, ""Oh Allah, rid me of this thing and deliver me therefrom."" And immediately his prickle disappeared altogether and he became clean smooth. When his wife saw this she said, ""I have no occasion for thee, now thou art become pegless as a eunuch, shaven and shorn."" And he answered her, saying, ""All this comes of thine ill-omened counsel and thine imbecile judgment. I had three prayers accepted of Allah, wherewith I might have gotten me my good, both in this world and in the next, and now two wishes are gone in pure waste, by thy lewd will, and there remaineth but one."" Quoth she, ""Pray Allah the Most High to restore thee thy yard as it was."" So he prayed to his Lord and his prickle was restored to its first estate. Thus the man lost his three wishes by the lack of wit in the woman. Once upon a time, and be sure 'twas a long time ago, there lived a poor woodman in a great forest, and every day of his life he went out to fell timber. So one day he started out, and the goodwife filled his wallet and slung his bottle on his back, that he might have meat and drink in the forest. He had marked out a huge old oak, which, thought he, would furnish many and many a good plank. And when he was come to it, he took his ax in his hand and swung it round his head as though he were minded to fell the tree at one stroke. But he hadn't given one blow, when what should he hear but the pitifullest entreating, and there stood before him a fairy who prayed and beseeched him to spare the tree. He was dazed, as you may fancy, with wonderment and affright, and he couldn't open his mouth to utter a word. But he found his tongue at last, and, ""Well,"" said he, ""I'll e'en do as thou wishest."" ""You've done better for yourself than you know,"" answered the fairy, ""and to show I'm not ungrateful, I'll grant you your next three wishes, be they what they may."" And therewith the fairy was no more to be seen, and the woodman slung his wallet over his shoulder and his bottle at his side, and off he started home. But the way was long, and the poor man was regularly dazed with the wonderful thing that had befallen him, and when he got home there was nothing in his noddle but the wish to sit down and rest. Maybe, too, 'twas a trick of the fairy's. Who can tell? Anyhow, down he sat by the blazing fire, and as he sat he waxed hungry, though it was a long way off suppertime yet. ""Hasn't thou naught for supper, dame?"" said he to his wife. ""Nay, not for a couple of hours yet,"" said she. ""Ah!"" groaned the woodman, ""I wish I'd a good link of black pudding here before me."" No sooner had he said the word, when clatter, clatter, rustle, rustle, what should come down the chimney but a link of the finest black pudding the heart of man could wish for. If the woodman stared, the goodwife stared three times as much. ""What's all this?"" says she. Then all the morning's work came back to the woodman, and he told his tale right out, from beginning to end, and as he told it the goodwife glowered and glowered, and when he had made an end of it she burst out, ""Thou bee'st but a fool, Jan, thou bee'st but a fool; and I wish the pudding were at thy nose, I do indeed."" And before you could say ""Jack Robinson,"" there the goodman sat, and his nose was the longer for a noble link of black pudding. He gave a pull, but it stuck, and she gave a pull, but it stuck, and they both pulled till they had nigh pulled the nose off, but it stuck and stuck. ""What's to be done now?"" said he. ""'Tisn't so very unsightly,"" said she, looking hard at him. Then the woodman saw that if he wished, he must need wish in a hurry; and wish he did, that the black pudding might come off his nose.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Two-Headed Weaver,"In a certain place there lived a weaver by the name of Mantharaka, which means ""the simpleton."" One day, while weaving cloth, the wooden pieces on his loom broke. He took an ax, and set forth to find some wood. He found a large sissoo tree at the ocean's shore, and said aloud, ""Now this is a large tree. If I fell it, I will have wood enough for all my weaving tools."" Having thus thought it through, he raised his ax to begin cutting. However, a spirit lived in this tree, and he said, ""Listen! This tree is my home, and it must be spared in any event, because I like it here where my body can be stroked by the cool breezes that blow in from the ocean's waves."" The weaver said, ""Then what am I to do? If I don't find a good tree, then my family will starve. You will have to go somewhere else. I am going to cut it down."" The spirit answered, ""Listen, I am at your service. Ask whatever you would like, but spare this tree!"" The weaver said, ""If that is what you want then I will go home and ask my friend and my wife, and when I return, you must give me what I ask for."" The spirit promised, and the weaver, beside himself with joy, returned home. Upon his arrival in his city he saw his friend, the barber, and said, ""Friend, I have gained control over a spirit. Tell me what I should demand from him!"" The barber said, ""My dear friend, if that is so then you should demand a kingdom. You could be king, and I would be your prime minister, and we two would first enjoy the pleasures of this world and then those of the next one. For they say: A prince who piously gives to others, achieves fame in this world, and through these good deeds, he will arrive in heaven, equal to the gods themselves."" The weaver spoke, ""Friend, so be it! But let us also ask my wife."" The barber said, ""One should never ask women for advice. They also say: A wise man gives women food, clothing, jewelry, and above all the duties of marriage, but he never asks for their advice. And further: That house must perish where a woman, a gambler, or a child is listened to. And: A man will advance and be loved by worthy people as long as he does not secretly listen to women. Women think only of their own advantage, of their own desires. Even if they love only their own son, still, he will serve their wishes."" The weaver spoke, ""Even though this is true, she nonetheless must be asked, because she is subservient to her husband."" Having said this, he went quickly to his wife and said to her, ""Dear one, today I have gained control over a spirit who will grant me one wish. Hence I have come to ask for your advice. Tell me, what should I ask for? My friend the barber thinks that I should request a kingdom."" She answered, ""Oh, son of your excellence, what do barbers understand? You should never do what they say. After all, it is stated: A reasonable person will no sooner take advice from dancers, singers, the low born, barbers, or children, than from beggars. Furthermore, a king's life is an unending procession of annoyances. He must constantly worry about friendships, animosities, wars, servants, defense alliances, and duplicity. He never gets a moment's rest, because: Anyone who wants to rule must prepare his spirit for misfortune. The same container that is used for salve can also be used to pour out bad luck. Never envy the life of a king."" The weaver said, ""You are right. But what should I ask for?"" She answered, ""You can now work on only one piece of cloth at a time. That is barely enough to pay for the necessities. You should ask for another pair of arms and a second head so that you can work on two pieces of cloth at once, one in front of you, and one behind you. We can sell the one for household necessities, and you can use the money from the second one for other things. You will thus gain the praise of your relatives, and you will make gains in both worlds."" After hearing this he spoke with joy, ""Good, you faithful wife! You have spoken well, and I will do what you say. That is my decision."" With that he went to the spirit and let his will be known, ""Listen, if you want to fulfill my wish, then give me another pair of arms and another head."" He had barely spoken before he was two-headed and four-armed. Rejoicing, he returned home, but the people there thought that he was a demon and beat him with sticks and stones, until he fell over dead. And that is why I say: He who cannot think for himself and will not follow the advice of friends, he will push himself into misfortune, just like the weaver Mantharaka.",The Panchatantra,"Source: Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen, translated from the Sanskrit into German by Theodor Benfey (Leipzig: F.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Wishes,"There was once, it doesn't matter where: there was once upon a time, a poor man who had a pretty young wife; they were very fond of each other. The only thing they had to complain of was their poverty, as neither of them owned a farthing; it happened, therefore, sometimes, that they quarreled a little, and then they always cast it in each other's teeth that they hadn't got anything to bless themselves with. But still they loved each other. One evening the woman came home much earlier than her husband and went into the kitchen and lighted the fire, although she had nothing to cook. ""I think I can cook a little soup, at least, for my husband. It will be ready by the time he comes home."" But no sooner had she put the kettle over the fire, and a few logs of wood on the fire in order to make the water boil quicker, than her husband arrived home and took his seat by the side of her on the little bench. They warmed themselves by the fire, as it was late in the autumn and cold. In the neighboring village they had commenced the vintage on that very day. ""Do you know the news, wife?"" inquired he. ""No, I don't. I've heard nothing. Tell me what it is."" ""As I was coming from the squire's maize field, I saw in the dark, in the distance, a black spot on the road. I couldn't make out what it was, so I went nearer, and lo! do you know what it was? -- A beautiful little golden carriage, with a pretty little woman inside, and four fine black dogs harnessed to it."" ""You're joking,"" interrupted the wife. ""I'm not, indeed, it's perfectly true. You know how muddy the roads about here are; it happened that the dogs stuck fast with the carriage and they couldn't move from the spot; the little woman didn't care to get out into the mud, as she was afraid of soiling her golden dress. At first, when I found out what it was, I had a good mind to run away, as I took her for an evil spirit, but she called out after me and implored me to help her out of the mud; she promised that no harm should come to me, but on the contrary she would reward me. So I thought that it would be a good thing for us if she could help us in our poverty; and with my assistance the dogs dragged her carriage out of the mud. The woman asked me whether I was married. I told her I was. And she asked me if I was rich. I replied, not at all; I didn't think, I said, that there were two people in our village who were poorer than we. 'That can be remedied,' replied she. 'I will fulfill three wishes that your wife may propose.' And she left as suddenly as if dragons had kidnapped her. She was a fairy."" ""Well, she made a regular fool of you!"" ""That remains to be seen. You must try and wish something, my dear wife."" Thereupon the woman without much thought said, ""Well, I should like to have some sausage, and we could cook it beautifully on this nice fire."" No sooner were the words uttered than a frying pan came down the chimney, and in it a sausage of such length that it was long enough to fence in the whole garden. ''This is grand!"" they both exclaimed together. ""But we must be a little more clever with our next two wishes; how well we shall be off! I will at once buy two heifers and two horses, as well as a sucking pig,"" said the husband. Whereupon he took his pipe from his hatband, took out his tobacco pouch, and filled his pipe; then he tried to light it with a hot cinder, but was so awkward about it that he upset the frying pan with the sausage in it. ""Good heavens! The sausage! What on earth are you doing! I wish that sausage would grow on to your nose,"" exclaimed the frightened woman, and tried to snatch the same out of the fire, but it was too late, as it was already dangling from her husband's nose down to his toes. ""My Lord Creator help me!"" shouted the woman. ""You see, you fool, what you've done, there! Now the second wish is gone,"" said her husband. ""What can we do with this thing?"" ""Can't we get it off?"" said the woman. ""Take off the devil! Don't you see that it has quite grown to my nose. You can't take it off."" ""Then we must cut it off,"" said she, ""as we can do nothing else."" ""I shan't permit it. How could I allow my body to be cut about? Not for all the treasures on earth. But do you know what we can do, love? There is yet one wish left. You'd better wish that the sausage go back to the pan, and so all will be right."" But the woman replied, "" How about the heifers and the horses, and how about the sucking pig? How shall we get those?"" ""Well, I can't walk about with this ornament, and I'm sure you won't kiss me again with this sausage dangling from my nose."" And so they quarreled for a long time, till at last he succeeded in persuading his wife to wish that the sausage go back to the pan. And thus all three wishes were fulfilled; and yet they were as poor as ever. They, however, made a hearty meal of the sausage; and as they came to the conclusion that it was in consequence of their quarrelling that they had no heifers, nor horses, nor sucking pig, they agreed to live thenceforth in harmony together; and they quarreled no more after this. They got on much better in the world, and in time they acquired heifers, horses, and a sucking pig into the bargain, because they were industrious and thrifty.",Hungary,"Source: W.

Foolish Wishes,0750a,The Woodman's Three Wishes,"Whether from natural forgetfulness, or fairy illusion, we know not, but certain it is, that long before evening all remembrance of his visitor had passed from his noddle. At night, when he and his dame were dozing before a blazing fire, the old fellow waxed hungry, and audibly wished for a link of hog's pudding. No sooner had the words escaped his lips than a rustling was heard in the chimney, and down came a bunch of the wished-for delicacies, depositing themselves at the feet of the astounded woodman, who, thus reminded of his morning visitor, began to communicate the particulars to his wife. ""Thou bist a fool, Jan,"" said she, incensed at her husband's carelessness in neglecting to make the best of his good luck. "" I wish em wer atte noäse!"" whereupon, the legend goes on to state, they immediately attached themselves to the member in question, and stuck so tight that the woodman, finding no amount of force would remove these unsightly appendages from his proboscis, was obliged, reluctantly, to wish them off, thus making the third wish, and at once ending his brilliant expectations.",England,"Source: Thomas Sternberg, The Dialect and Folk-lore of Northamptonshire (London: John Russell Smith, 1851), pp. 135-36.",Sternberg does not give this story a title.,NA

One day, being in charge of twelve donkeys employed to carry earth to the city, it occurred to him, before starting with the laden animals, to count them. Finding the tale [tally] complete, he took them to their destination and unloaded them. He then mounted one of them, and was going to return when he found one donkey missing. At once dismounting, he put them all in a row, and was astonished and greatly relieved to find the twelve there. He thereupon remounted and set off again, wondering as he rode along how it was that he had missed one donkey. Suddenly the suspicion flashed upon him that possibly the second count had been faulty, so he counted again, to find once more that only eleven were racing along in front of him. Terribly disconcerted, he again got down off the creature he was riding and, stopping the others, once more counted them. He was puzzled to find that there were again twelve. So absorbed was he by this mystery, that he went on counting and recounting the donkeys till his master, surprised at his long absence, came and solved his difficulty by obliging him to follow his asses on foot.",Palestine,"Source: J.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Emelyan the Fool,"In a certain village lived one time a peasant, who had three sons, two of whom were clever, but the third was a fool, and his name was Emelyan. And when the peasant had lived a long time, and was grown very old, he called his three sons to him, and said to them, ""My dear children, I feel that I have not much longer to live, so I give you the house and cattle, which you will divide among you, share and share alike. I have also given you each a hundred rubles."" Soon after, the old man died, and the sons, when they had buried him, lived on happy and contented. Some time afterward Emelyan's brothers took a fancy to go to the city and trade with the hundred rubles their father had left them. So they said to Emelyan, ""Hark ye, fool! We are going to the city, and will take your hundred rubles with us. And if we prosper in trade, we will buy you a red coat, red boots, and a red cap. But do you stay here at home. And when our wives, your sisters-in-law, desire you to do anything, do as they bid you."" The fool, who had a great longing for a red coat and cap, and red boots, answered that he would do whatever his sisters-in-law bade him. So his brothers went off to the city, and the fool stayed at home with his two sisters. One day, when the winter was come, and the cold was great, his sisters-in-law told him to go out and fetch water. But the fool remained lying on the stove, and said, ""Aye, indeed, and who then are you?"" The sisters began to scold him, and said, ""How now, fool! We are what you see. You know how cold it is, and that it is a man's business to go."" But he said, ""I am lazy."" ""How,"" they exclaimed, ""are you lazy?"" Surely you will want to eat, and if we have no water we cannot cook. But never mind,"" they added. ""We will only tell our husbands not to give him anything when they have bought the fine red coat and all for him!"" The fool heard what they said. And, as he longed greatly to have the red coat and cap, he saw that he must go. So he got down from the stove and began to put on his shoes and stockings and to dress himself to go out. When he was dressed, he took the buckets and the ax and went down to the river hard by. And when he came to the river he began to cut a large hole in the ice. Then he drew water in the buckets, and setting them on the ice, he stood by the hole, looking into the water. And as the fool was looking, he saw a large pike swimming about. However stupid Emelyan was, he felt a wish to catch this pike. So he stole cautiously and softly to the edge of the hole, and making a sudden grasp at the pike he caught him, and pulled him out of the water. Then, putting him in his bosom, he was hastening home with him, when the pike cried out, ""Ho, fool! Why have you caught me?"" He answered, ""To take you home and get my sisters-in-law to cook you."" ""Nay, fool! Do not take me home, but throw me back into the water, and I will make a rich man of you."" But the fool would not consent and jogged on his way home. When the pike saw that the fool was not for letting him go, he said to him, ""Hark ye, fool! Put me back in the water, and will do for you everything you do not like to do yourself. You will only have to wish, and it shall be done."" On hearing this, the fool rejoiced beyond measure, for as he was uncommonly lazy, he thought to himself, ""If the pike does everything I have no mind to do, all will be done without my being troubled to work."" So he said to the pike, ""I will throw you back into the water if you do all you promise."" The pike said, ""Let me go first, and then I will keep my promise."" But the fool answered, ""Nay, nay, you must first perform your promise, and then I will let you go."" When the pike saw that Emelyan would not put him into the water, he said, ""If you wish me to do all you desire, you must first tell me what your desire is."" ""I wish,"" said the fool, ""that my buckets should go of themselves from the river up the hill to the village without spilling any of the water."" Then said the pike, ""Listen now, and remember the words I say to you: 'At the pike's command, go, buckets, of yourselves up the hill!'"" Then the fool repeated after him these words, and instantly, with the speed of thought, the buckets ran up the hill. When Emelyan saw this he was amazed beyond measure, and he said to the pike, ""But will it always be so?"" ""Everything you desire will be done,"" replied the pike. ""But I warn you not to forget the words I have taught you."" Then Emelyan put the pike into the water and followed his buckets home. The neighbors were all amazed and said the one another, ""This fool makes the buckets come up of themselves from the river, and he follows them home at his leisure."" But Emelyan took no notice of them, and went his way home. The buckets were by this time in the house, and standing in their place on the foot-bench. So the fool got up and stretched himself on the stove. After some time his sisters-in-law said to him again, ""Emelyan, why are you lazying there? Get up and go cut wood."" But the fool replied, ""Yes! And you -- who are you?"" ""Don't you see it is now winter, and if you don't cut wood you will be frozen?"" ""I am lazy,"" said the fool. ""What! You are lazy?"" cried the sisters. ""If you do not go instantly and cut wood, we will tell our husbands not to give you the red coat, or the red cap, or the fine red boots!"" The fool, who longed for the red cap, coat, and boots, saw that he must go and cut the wood. But as it was bitterly cold, and he did not like to come down from off the stove, he repeated in an undertone, as he lay, the words, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, ax, and hew the wood! And do you, logs, come of yourselves in the stove!"" Instantly the ax jumped up, ran out into the yard, and began to cut up the wood. And the logs came of themselves into the house, and laid themselves in the stove. When the sisters saw this, they wondered exceedingly at the cleverness of the fool. And, as the ax did of its own accord the work whenever Emelyan was wanted to cut wood, he lived for some time in peace and harmony with them. At length the wood was all finished, and they said to him, ""Emelyan, we have no more wood, so you must go in the forest and cut some."" ""Aye,"" said the fool, ""and you, who are you, then?"" The sisters replied, ""The wood is far off, and it is winter, and too cold for us to go."" But the fool only said, ""I am lazy."" ""How! You are lazy?"" cried they. ""You will be frozen then. And moreover, we will take care, when our husbands come home, that they shall not give you the red coat, cap, and boots."" As the fool longed for the clothes, he saw that he must go and cut the wood. So he got off the stove, put on his shoes and stockings, and dressed himself. And, when he was dressed, he went into the yard, dragged the sledge out of the shed, took a rope and the ax with him, and called out to his sisters-in-law, ""Open the gate."" When the sisters saw that he was riding off without any horses, they cried, ""Why, Emelyan, you have got on the sledge without yoking the horses!"" But he answered that he wanted no horses, and bade them only open the gate. So the sisters threw open the gate, and the fool repeated the words, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, away, sledge, off to the wood!"" Instantly the sledge galloped out of the yard at such a rate that the people of the village, when they saw it, were filled with amazement at Emelyan's riding the sledge without horses, and with such speed that a pair of horses could never have drawn it at such a rate. The fool had to pass through the town on his way to the wood, and away he dashed at full speed. But the fool did not know that he should cry out, ""Make way!"" so that he did not run over anyone. But away he went, and rode over quite a lot of people. An, though they ran after him, no one was able to overtake and bring him back. At last Emelyan, having go clear of the town, came to the wood and stopped his sledge. then he got down and said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, ax, hew wood. And you, logs, lay yourselves on the sledge and tie yourselves together."" Scarcely had the fool uttered these words when the ax began to cut wood, the logs to lay themselves on the sledge, and the rope to tie them down. When the ax had cut wood enough, Emelyan desired it to cut him a good cudgel. And when the ax had done this, he mounted the sledge and cried, ""Up, and away! At the pike's command, and at my desire, go home, sledge!"" Away then went the sledge at the top of its speed, and when he come to the town, where he had hurt so many people, he found a crowd waiting to catch him. And, as soon as he got into the gates, they laid hold of him, dragged him off his sledge, and fell to beating him. When the fool saw how they were treating him, he said in an under voice, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, cudgel, and thrash them!"" Instantly the cudgel began to lay about it on all sides. and, when the people were all driven away, he made his escape, and come to his own village. The cudgel, having thrashed all soundly, rolled home after him. And Emelyan, as usual, when he got home, climbed up and lay upon the stove. After he had left the town, all the people fell to talking, no so much of the number of persons he had injured, as of their amazement at his riding in a sledge without horses. And the news spread from on to another, till it reached the court and came to the ears of the king. And when the king heard it, he felt an extreme desire to see him. So he sent an officer with some soldiers to look for him. The officer instantly started, and took the road that the fool had taken. And when he came to the village where Emelyan lived, he summoned the starosta, or head-man of the village, and said to him, ""I am sent by the king to take a certain fool, and bring him before his majesty."" The starosta at once showed him the house where Emelyan lived, and the officer went into it and asked where the fool was. He was lying on the stove, and answered, ""What is it you want with me?"" ""How!"" said the officer. ""What do I want with you? Get up this instant and dress yourself. I must take you to the king."" But Emelyan said, ""What to do?"" Whereat the officer became so enraged at the rudeness of his replies that he hit him on the cheek. ""At the pike's command, and at my desire,"" said the fool, ""up, cudgel, and thrash them!"" Instantly up sprang the cudgel and began to lay about it on all sides. So the officer was obliged to go back to the town as fast as he could. And when he came before the king, and told him how the fool had cudgeled him, the king marveled greatly, and would not believe the story. Then the king called to him a wise man and ordered him to bring the fool by craft, if nothing else would do. So the wise man went to the village where Emelyan lived, called the starosta before him, and said, ""I am ordered by the king to take your fool. And therefore ask for persons with whom he lived."" Then the starosta ran and fetched Emelyan's sisters-in-law. The king's messenger asked them what it was the fool liked, and they answered, ""Noble sir, if anyone entreats our fool earnestly to anything, he flatly refuses the first and second time. The third time he consents, and does what he is required, for he dislikes to be roughly treated."" The king's messenger thereupon dismissed them and forbade them to tell Emelyan that he had summoned them before him. Then he brought raisins, baked plums, and grapes, and went to the fool. When he came into the room, he went up to the stove and said, ""Emelyan, why are you lying there?"" And with that he gave him the raisins, the baked plums, and the grapes, and said, ""Emelyan, we will go together to the king. I will take you with me."" But the fool replied, ""I am very warm here,"" for there was nothing he liked so much as being warm. Then the messenger began to entreat him, ""Be so good, Emelyan, do let us go! You will like the court vastly."" ""No,"" said the fool. ""I am lazy."" But the messenger entreated him once more, ""Do come with me, there's my good fellow, and the king will give you a fine red coat and cap, and a pair of red boots."" When the fool heard of the red coat he said, ""Go on before. I will follow you."" The messenger pressed him no further, but went out and asked the sisters-in-law if there was any danger of the fool's deceiving him. They assured him there was not, and he went away. Emelyan, who remained lying on the stove, then said to himself, ""How I dislike this going to the king!"" And after a minute's thought, he said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up stove, and away to the town!"" And instantly the wall of the room opened, and the stove moved out. And when it got clear of the yard, it went at such a rate that there was no overtaking it. Soon it came up with the king's messenger, and went along with him into the palace. When the king saw the fool coming, he went forth with all his court to meet him. And he was amazed beyond measure at seeing Emelyan come riding on the stove. But the fool lay still and said nothing. Then the king asked him why he had upset so many people on his way to the wood. ""It was their own fault,"" said the fool. ""Why did they not get out of the way?"" Just at that moment the king's daughter came to the window, and Emelyan happening suddenly to look up, and seeing how handsome she was, said in a whisper, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, let this lovely maiden fall in love with me!"" And scarcely had he spoken the words when the king's daughter in love with him. Then said the fool, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, up, stove, and away home!"" Immediately the stove left the palace, went through the town, returned home, and set itself in its old place. And Emelyan lived there for some time comfortably and happy. But it was very different in the town. For, at the word of Emelyan, the king's daughter had fallen in love, and she began to implore her father to give her the fool for her husband. The king was in a great rage, both with her and with fool, but he knew not how to catch him. Then his minister proposed that the same officer, as a punishment for not succeeding the first time, should be sent again to take Emelyan. This advice pleased the king, and he summoned the officer to his presence, and said, ""Hark ye, friend! I sent you before for the fool, and you came back without him. To punish you, I now send you for him a second time. If you bring him, you shall be rewarded. If you return without him, you shall be punished."" When the officer heard this, he left the king and lost no time to going in quest of the fool. And on coming to the village he called for the starosta and said to him, ""Here is money for you. Buy everything necessary for a good dinner tomorrow. Invite Emelyan, and when he comes, make him drink until he falls asleep."" The starosta, knowing that the officer came from the king, was obliged to obey him, so he bought all that was required and invited the fool. And Emelyan said he would come, whereat the officer was greatly rejoiced. So next day the fool came to dinner, and the starosta plied him so well with drink that he fell fast asleep. When the officer saw this, he ordered the kibitka (or carriage) to be brought, and putting the fool into it, they drove off to the town, and went straight to the palace. As soon as the king heard that they were come, he ordered a large cask to be provided without delay, and to be bound with strong iron hoops. When the cask was brought to the king, and he saw that everything was ready as he desired, he commanded his daughter and the fool to be put in it, and the cask to be well pitched. And when this was done, the cask was thrown into the sea, and left to the mercy of the waves. Then the king returned to his palace, and the cask floated along upon the sea. All this time the fool was fast asleep. When he awoke, and saw that it was quite dark, he said to himself, ""Where am I?"" for he thought he was alone. But the princess said, ""You are in a cask, Emelyan! And I am shut up with you in it."" ""But who are you?"" said the fool. ""I am the king's daughter,"" replied she. And she told him why she had been shut up there with him. Then she besought him to free himself and her out of the cask, but the fool said, ""Nay, I am warm enough here."" ""But grant me at least the favor,"" said the princess. ""Have pity on my tears, and deliver me out of this cask."" ""Why so?"" said Emelyan. ""I am lazy."" Then the princess began to entreat him still more urgently, until the fool was at last moved by her tears and entreaties, and said, ""Well, I will do this for you."" Then he said softly, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, cast us, O sea, upon the shore, where we may dwell on dry land. But let it be near our own country. And, cask, fall to pieces on the shore."" Scarcely had the fool uttered these words when the waves began to roll, and the cask was thrown on a dry place, and fell to pieces of itself. So Emelyan got up and went with the princess round about the spot where they were cast. And the fool saw that they were on a fine island, where there was an abundance of trees, with all kinds of fruit upon them. When the princess saw this, she was greatly rejoiced and said, ""But, Emelyan, where shall we live? There is not even a nook here."" ""You want too much,"" said the fool. ""Grant me one favor,"" replied the princess. ""Let there be at least a little cottage in which we may shelter ourselves from the rain,"" for the princess knew that he could do everything that he wished. But the fool said, ""I am lazy."" Nevertheless, she went on entreating him, until at last Emelyan was obliged to do as she desired. Then he stepped aside and said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, let me have in the middle of this island a finer castle than the king's, and let a crystal bridge lead from my castle to the royal palace. And let there be attendants of all conditions in the court!"" Hardly were the words spoken, when there appeared a splendid castle, with a crystal bridge. The fool went with the princess into the castle and beheld the apartments all magnificently furnished, and a number of persons, footmen and all kinds of officers, who waited for the fool's commands. When he saw that all these men were like men, and the he alone was ugly and stupid, he wished to be better, so he said, ""At the pike's command, and at my desire, away, let me become a youth without an equal, and extremely wise!"" And hardly had he spoken, when he became so handsome and so wise that all were amazed. Emelyan now sent on of his servants to the king to invite him and all his court. So the servant went along the crystal bridge which the fool had made, and when he came to the court, the ministers brought him before the king, and Emelyan's messenger said, ""Please, your majesty, I am sent by my master to invite you do dinner."" The king asked him who his master was, but he answered, ""Please, your majesty, I can tell you nothing about my master (for the fool had ordered him not to tell who he was), but if you come to dine with him, he will inform you himself."" The king, being curious to know who had sent to invite him, told the messenger that he would go without fail. The servant went away, and when he got home, the king and his court set out along the crystal bridge to go and visit the fool. And, when they arrived at the castle, Emelyan came forth to meet the king, took him by his white hands, kissed him on his sugared lips, led him into his castle, and seated him at the oaken tables covered with fine diaper tablecloths, and spread with sugar-meats and honey-drinks. The king and him ministers ate and drank and made merry. When they rose from the table and retired, the fool said to the king, ""Does your majesty know who I am?"" As Emelyan was now dressed in fine clothes, and was very handsome, it was not possible to recognize him, so the king replied that he did not know him. Then the fool said, ""Does not your majesty recollect how a fool came riding on a stove to your court, and how you fastened him up in a pitched cask with your daughter, and cast them into the sea? Know me now. I am that Emelyan."" When the king saw him thus in his presence he was greatly terrified and knew not what to do. But the fool went to the princess and led her out to him. And the king, on seeing his daughter, was greatly rejoiced, and said, ""I have been very unjust to you, and so I gladly give you my daughter to wife."" The fool humbly thanked the king. And when Emelyan had prepared everything for the wedding, it was celebrated with great magnificence, and the following day the fool gave a feast to the ministers and all the people. When the festivities were at an end, the king wanted to give up his kingdom to his son-in-law, but Emelyan did not wish to have the crown. So the king went back to his kingdom, and the fool remained in the castle and lived happily.",Russia,"Source: Robert Steele, The Russian Garland: Being Russian Folk Tales Translated from a Collection of Chapbooks Made in Moscow (London: A.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Halfman,"Then God gave her a boy with half a head, half a nose, half a mouth, half a body, one hand and one foot. He was so misshapen that the mother always kept him at home and did not send him out to work. One day, however, he became bored, and he said to his mother, ""Mother, I do not want to stay at home any longer. Give me an ax and a mule. I want to go out into the woods to fetch wood."" His mother replied, ""How can you chop wood, dear child? You are only half a person."" Nonetheless, he begged so long that finally his mother gave him an ax and a mule. He took these into the woods. He chopped wood and brought it back home. He did this work so well that his mother allowed him to continue. One day when he was fetching wood he passed by the princess's castle. When she saw him with one foot and one arm sitting on the mule she laughed out loud and called to her maidservants, ""Come and see the half man!"" This embarrassed Halfman so much that he dropped his ax. He thought for a moment, then asked himself, ""Shall I get off and pick it up, or shall I not?"" In the end he did not get off, but instead left the ax lying there rode on. The princess said to the maidservants, ""Just look at Halfman! He drops his ax and doesn't even get off to pick it up!"" This embarrassed Halfman even more, and he dropped his rope. Once again he thought for a moment, then said to himself, ""Shall I get off and pick up the rope, or shall I not?"" In the end he rode off, leaving the rope lying there. With that the princess called to her maidservants, ""Just look at Halfman! He drops his ax and his rope and doesn't even get off to pick them up!"" Halfman rode on to the place where he was gathering wood, but arriving there he said to himself, ""How can I chop wood, and how can I tie it together?"" A lake was there, and while he stood there looking into the water he saw a fish swim up to the bank. He quickly threw his ragged coat onto it and caught it. The fish begged for its life, saying, ""Let me loose, Halfman, and I will teach you a charm to make all your wishes come true."" Then Halfman said, ""If what you say is true, then load my mule with wood."" The fish said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, the mule shall be loaded with wood!"" And behold, before he finished speaking this charm, the mule was loaded with wood. Seeing this, Halfman said to the fish, ""If you will teach me the charm I will set you free."" The fish said, ""Whenever you want something to happen, just say, 'By the first word of God and the second word of the fish,' and whatever you wish for shall be granted."" With that Halfman set the fish free, took his loaded mule, and walked off toward the princess's castle. When the princess saw him she called to her maidservants, ""Come quickly and see how Halfman has loaded his mule without an ax or a rope."" Then they all laughed until they could laugh no more. This made Halfman angry, and he said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let the princess become pregnant!"" When her time came she bore a child, and no one knew who the father was. Her father summoned her and asked her who the father was, but she answered repeatedly, ""I have not even spoken with a man. I do not know where the child came from."" When the child was older the king summoned everyone to his capitol. After they had all gathered there he gave the child an apple and said, ""Go forth and give this to your father."" While the child was walking about and playing with the apple, he dropped it onto the ground, and it rolled away from him, finally coming to a rest in the corner where Halfman was standing. The child bent over to pick up the apple, then lifting his head he saw Halfman and said, ""Here Papa! Take the apple!"" Hearing this, the people took hold of Halfman and brought him before the king. The king said, ""Because it was Halfman who did this, we must kill them all: him, the princess, and the child."" However, some of his councilors said to him, ""What you say is unjust. The princess is your daughter, and you cannot shed your own blood. It would be better to make an iron cask, put the princess, Halfman, and the child inside, and throw them into the sea. Give them only a bunch of figs for the child, so that it will not die too quickly."" This advice pleased the king. Thus he had the cask made, the three placed inside, and thrown into the sea. Now seated inside the cask, the princess said to Halfman, ""I have never seen you before. How is it that we are now here together?"" ""Give me a fig,"" replied Halfman, ""and I will tell you about it."" The princess gave him a fig from those that they had brought along for the child. After he had eaten it, Halfman said, ""Don't you remember how you laughed at me when I passed by the castle, and I dropped my ax and my rope?"" ""Yes, I remember that,"" replied the princess. ""Now I know a charm, and when I repeat it my every wish is fulfilled. At that time I wished that you should become pregnant, and that is why you became pregnant."" To that the princess said, ""If you know such a charm that fulfills your every wish, then wish us out of this cask and onto dry land."" Halfman replied, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so."" So the princess gave him a fig, and he secretly said, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, may this cask drift onto dry land and open itself so that we can get out."" And immediately the cask hit dry land, opened itself, and they all got out. It was raining outside, and the princess said, ""Speak your charm so that we can find shelter and not get wet."" Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so."" So the princess gave him a fig, and he said to himself, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let there be shelter here!"" Suddenly such was the case, and they got under it. The princess said to Halfman, ""Until now you have done very well! Now speak your charm and give us a large castle whose stones and timbers and furnishings all can speak."" Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will do so."" So the princess gave him a fig, and he said to himself, ""By the first word of God and the second word of the fish, let there be castle whose stones and timbers and furnishings all can speak!"" Suddenly such a castle was there, and everything connected to it could speak, and they went inside to live there, and Halfman brought forth everything that they needed and whatever the princess wished for herself. One day the king was out hunting, and he saw in the distance a castle that he had never seen before. He sent two of his servants thither, saying to them, ""Take these partridges, go to that castle and broil them there, and see what kind of castle it is, for I have often been here hunting, but I have never before noticed it."" The servants, thus commanded by the king, took the partridges and went to the castle. When they approached the outer door, it said to them, ""What do you want here?"" They said, ""The king sent us here to broil these two partridges."" The door replied, ""Stay here. First I must ask the lady of the house."" Then the outer door asked the first inner door, which in turn asked the second one, which in turn asked the third one, and so on, door to door, until the question reached the lady of the house. She ordered that the strangers be admitted, and suddenly all the doors opened by themselves, allowing the servants to come inside. They were greatly amazed when even the stones and the timbers welcomed them. Entering the kitchen one of them said, ""Where can we find some wood?"" The pieces of wood called out, ""Here we are!"" Then they said to one another, ""We have no salt and no butter,"" to which the salt and butter called out, ""Here we are!"" After they had prepared the partridges, put them on the spit, and placed them next to the fire, they wanted to look around outside the kitchen to see if there were other things in the castle that could speak. However, they found so many such things and stayed away from the kitchen so long that the partridges had burned to charcoal when they finally thought about them and ran back to the kitchen. They did not know how they could excuse themselves to the king for having burned up his partridges. Finally they decided to go directly back to him and tell him what they had seen. The king did not believe them, and he sent other servants thither. They experienced the same things that the first ones had, and when the king heard them say the same thing, he decided that he would go there himself to see and hear with his own eyes and ears. When he arrived at the outside door, it said to him, ""Welcome, your majesty!"" When he went inside, all the stones and timbers called out the same welcome to him, and the king was amazed that here wood and stones could talk. Hearing that the king himself had arrived, the princess went to him to receive him. She led him into her splendid rooms, but did not tell him who she was. The king wondered about her correct manners and her elegant speech. Meanwhile the servants in the kitchen wanted to broil the partridges that the king had brought, and the same thing happened to them that had happened to the others. Amazed at all they saw and heard, they let the partridges burn to charcoal. When the king learned of this he became extremely angry, for he was very hungry and now had nothing to eat. The princess said, ""I beg of your majesty to do us the favor of dining in our humble house."" The king accepted, and she left him in order to look for Halfman, who had sneaked away from the king. Finding him, she said, ""I invited the king to eat with us. Now speak a charm to provide a splendid feast with the appropriate servants, musicians, dancers, and everything else to go with it."" To this Halfman said, ""Give me a fig, and I will speak the charm."" So the princess gave him a fig, and after he had eaten it he spoke the charm, asking for everything that the princess wanted, and suddenly a feast appeared, with everything that went with it. As soon as the king and his servants were seated at the table the musicians began to play, and they played so beautifully that the king was amazed. He said, ""I am a king, but I have never had such music in my castle."" Then the dancers began to dance, and they danced so beautifully that the king said to the princess, ""I am a king, but I have never had such dancers in my castle. Tell me how you came to them."" The princess replied, ""My father left them to me as an inheritance."" Then the princess went to Halfman and said, ""You must speak a charm that will put a spoon into one of the king's boots."" Halfman replied, ""Give me a fig and I will do so."" The princess gave him a fig, and he spoke the charm, granting the princess's wish. When the king was about to depart, the princes said, ""Wait a moment. I believe that something is missing."" This disturbed the king, who said, ""No, that is not possible. We are not such people!"" But the princess would not be dissuaded. She called out, ""Are you platters all there?"" ""Yes!"" ""Are you plates all there?"" ""Yes!"" ""Are you spoons all there?"" With that the spoon inside the king's boot called out, ""I am stuck in the king's boot!"" Now the princess began to scold the king, saying, ""I invited you into my house, prepared a feast for you, and granted you every honor, and now your are stealing one of my spoons! Are you not ashamed of yourself?"" The king said, ""This is not possible! Someone put the spoon into my boot! You are doing me a severe injustice!"" To that the princess said, ""You also did such an injustice to me when you put Halfman and me into a cask, although I had done nothing wrong."" The king stood there a long time, speechless with amazement. Then the princess brought Halfman to him, and Halfman explained everything that had happened. The king was amazed at this tale. He took his daughter back home with him and married her to one of his noblemen. He appointed Halfman to be his chief bodyguard and gave him his most beautiful slave girl for a wife.",Greece,"Source: ""Der halbe Mensch,"" Johann Georg von Hahn, Griechische und albanesische Märchen, vol. 1 (Leipzig: Wilhelm Engelmann, 1864), pp. 102-109.","The episode of the spoon planted in the king's boot is reminiscent of the Bible story of Joseph, who had a silver goblet planted in his brother Benjamin's pack.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Hans Dumb,"There was a king who lived happily with his daughter, his only child. Quite suddenly the princess had a baby, but no one knew who the father was. For some time the king was beside himself. Finally he ordered the princess to take the child to the church. A lemon would be placed in his hand, and whoever he should give it to would be the child's father and the princess's husband. This happened, but only fine people were admitted into the church. However, in the town there was a small, crooked, hunchbacked lad who was not very smart and who was therefore known as Hans Dumb. He mingled with the others and slipped into the church without being seen. When the child reached out with the lemon, it was to Hans Dumb! The princess was horrified, and the king was so taken aback that he had her, the child, and Hans Dumb placed into a cask and set adrift at sea. The cask soon drifted away, and when they were alone at sea the princess cried out bitterly, ""You horrid, hunchbacked, impudent rogue, you are the cause of my suffering. Why did you force your way into the church? You have nothing to do with the child."" ""Oh yes,"" said Hans Dumb. ""I have a lot to do with it, because one day I wished that you would have a child, and my wishes come true."" ""If that is so, then wish us something to eat."" ""I can do that too,"" said Hans Dumb, and he wished for a plate filled with potatoes. The princess would have liked something better, but because she was so hungry she helped him eat the potatoes. After they had eaten their fill, Hans Dumb said, ""Now I shall wish us a fine ship!"" He had scarcely said this and they were sitting in a splendid ship, with an excess of everything that they might want. The helmsman steered straight for land, and as they were going ashore Hans Dumb said, ""Here there shall be a castle!"" And there was a splendid castle there, and servants dressed in gold came and led the princess and the child inside, and when they were in the middle of the great hall, Hans Dumb said, ""Now I wish to become a young and intelligent prince!"" Then his hump disappeared, and he was handsome and straight and friendly. He found favor with the princess, and he became her husband, and they lived happily for a long time. One day the old king got lost while out riding and came to their castle. He was amazed, because he had never seen it before, and he went inside. The princess recognized her father at once, but he did not know who she was, for he thought that she had long since drowned in the ocean. She received him with splendor, but when he wanted to go back home, she secretly placed a golden goblet into his pocket. After he had ridden away she sent some knights after him to stop him and see if he hadn't stolen the golden goblet. They found it in his pocket and brought him back. He swore to the princess that he had not stolen it and did not know how it came to be in his pocket. She said, ""You see, one should always be cautious about accusing another person."" With this she revealed herself as his daughter. The king was overjoyed, and they lived happily together, and after his death Hans Dumb became king.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Hans Dumm,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, 1st ed., vol. 1 (Berlin: Realschulbuchhandlung, 1812), no. 54, pp. 250-52.","This story was not included in later editions of the Grimms' famous collection.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Juvadi and the Princess,"The little princess was standing at one of the king's windows, and she began to laugh out loud. Juvadi saw her and said, ""May you get pregnant by me!"" She soon became pregnant, and nine months later gave birth to a girl. The king was so angry about this that he called together his council and said, ""Advise me what I should do to the person who has brought this shame upon me. I cannot believe what people are saying."" The councilors said, ""Bring together all the men in the kingdom, and then we shall see whom the child calls Papa."" So the king summoned all the men to his house. His barons, princes, knights, citizens, and peasants all came, but the child did not call any of them Papa. The only man left was Juvadi, who did not come. Then the king forced him to come, and the child had scarcely seen him when she called him Papa. Once again the king called together his council and asked, ""What should the punishment be for those who caused this shame?"" They answered, ""Let us put them into a cask and roll it over a cliff."" So they had a cask made and locked the princess, her daughter, and Juvadi inside, then rolled it to a cliff to push it over. As it rolled along, Juvadi said, ""Let me out! Let me out! I'll give you figs and raisins."" So saying, he threw handfuls of figs and raisins out of the cask. The cask stopped rolling at a level spot. Juvadi broke open the cask, and they all got out. A witch was in the vicinity, and she laughed so hard that a swelling on her neck disappeared. She was very happy about this, and she said to Juvadi, ""What is your wish? I can do everything, and will do something good for you."" Juvadi answered, ""Make a house for me, for we have no place to live."" The witch picked up a stick and made a circle with it, saying, ""Here shall be a palace, with all the comforts of the world."" Suddenly a beautiful palace was there, and Juvadi happily went inside with the princess and their daughter.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,"Lazy Lars, Who Won the Princess","Once upon a time there was a very poor couple who lived not far from the king's castle. They had but one son, and he was not very promising, for he was so terribly lazy that the grass had plenty of time to grow beneath his feet. If you asked him to have a seat, you would be sure to find him later in the same spot. His name was Lars, and no one called him anything but Lazy Lars. His parents worked every day up at the castle. His mother helped out in the kitchen and the father in the garden. Lars stayed at home the whole day doing nothing but turning into a complete lazybones. One day at noon his mother came home to fix something to eat for herself and the boy. She was about to hang the pot over the fire, but there was no water in the house. They didn't have a well, so they had to fetch their water from a spring on the other side of the castle. The mother said, ""Listen, Lazy Lars, run and fetch a little water from the spring, or there will be nothing for you to eat."" ""I'm going,"" said Lars, but he did not move from where he was sitting. She said it once again, and he gave her the same answer, but he did not move at all. Then the mother became angry and reached for the poker to teach Lazy Lars a lesson with it, so he had to get up after all. He took an old broad-brimmed hat and an old iron kettle whose feet had been knocked off and went on his way. But it was a slow trip, because the day was very hot and every few moments he turned the kettle upside down and sat on it for a while. As he was passing the castle it happened that the king's daughter, a young and spirited princess, was sitting at a window, and when she saw Lazy Lars, whom she knew well, and observed the trip he was making with the kettle, she broke out laughing and called down to him, ""Where are you going, Lazy Lars?"" ""To the spring to fetch water,"" he shouted. ""Hurry up, Lazy Lars, or else your kettle without legs will run away from you!"" she called back. Lars answered that there was no danger of that. ""You are going to need a boy to help you carry your kettle, Lazy Lars,"" she shouted haughtily. It made Lars angry that she was thus making fun of him, and he looked up toward the window. He had never before seen such a beautiful girl, and he was so taken back that he just stood there with his mouth open staring at her. She laughed at him even more and shouted, ""Close your mouth, Lazy Lars, or your heart will get cold!"" Then Lars picked up his feet and did not stop again to rest until he came to the spring. There he took a string, tied it to the handle of the kettle, and lowered it into the spring. The kettle filled with water, but when he pulled it back up there was a frog in it, and the frog could talk. Lars had never seen anything like this before. He set the kettle on the ground and looked in amazement at the frog, who asked him very politely if he could not be put back into the spring. But Lazy Lars said that that would not be possible, for it would be double the effort. The frog again asked politely, promising Lars that he could have one wish granted, if he would but put him back into the water. Lars thought that that would not be bad. He took his old broad-brimmed hat and threw it onto the ground, then said that he wanted to have as many wishes granted as there were blades of grass covered by the hat, for he thought it would be all the same to the frog if he was going to the trouble to grant a wish. So the frog was able to return to the spring and was happy about that. Lars sat down next to his kettle, which he had filled up again, in order to take his time and think about what he should fish for. Of course, he thought that the first thing he should wish for would be that his kettle should get some legs and be able to walk, so he would not have to carry it. Then the princess would not be able to laugh at his kettle, saying that it had no feet, and she would not be able to make fun of him by saying that he needed a boy to carry the kettle. He had scarcely uttered this wish, when the kettle had feet and looked like it wanted to run away. However, Lars took his time, for he wanted to think of another wish, but one did not come to him, so he and the kettle trotted off. He held tightly onto the string that he had tied to the kettle, so that it was half pulling him along behind. Because his large broad-brimmed hat grew too heavy and warm for him, he hung it on the kettle like a lid, and thus, like a proper kettle, it had both feet and a lid. When he arrived at the castle window the young princess was still there, and when she saw the procession coming by with the kettle and the hat and Lazy Lars, she had to laugh, and she laughed so terribly hard that it almost made her sick. ""Now your kettle is walking by itself, Lazy Lars, and you don't have to carry your hat either!"" she shouted. ""All you need now is a boy to push from behind!"" ""You yourself should have a boy,"" replied Lars, without thinking what he was saying, for he was tired of being teased. Then the princess closed the window, for she no longer wanted to talk with Lazy Lars. Lars arrived home safely with the kettle and got his noon meal. He did not give any thought to further wishes, for could not think of anything that he needed, so everything stayed as it was. Time passed as always, but nearly a year later something strange was happening at the castle, for the princess had gotten very ill. The doctors were called in. They shook their heads and wrote prescriptions, each one longer than the others, but nothing helped even a little bit. Then the princess's mother had a private talk with her. They spoke for a long time, and the princess cried and insisted that she was innocent, but the queen did not believe her. More time passed, and then there were no longer any doubts, for, as they say, a little barefoot boy came to the princes. The just old king nearly jumped out of his skin that such a scandal should come upon his house, and it did not make matters any better that the princess would not say anything about who the little prince's father was. For good or for evil, more time passed, and the fatherless prince was three years old when the king said that he could no longer endure the scandal. He would find out who the child's father was, and the princess would have to marry whoever it turned out to be. The king proclaimed across the whole realm that all men in the land, large and small, were to come together before the castle on a certain day. There they would hear the voice of the innocent child, who himself would determine who his father was. The day arrived, and a large mass of people, fine and course, came together. Around the castle it was black with people. On this day Lazy Lars's mother came home a little earlier than normal to prepare the noon meal, and as usual she found Lars sitting in the doorway enjoying the sunshine. ""I do say,"" she called out, ""does my Lazy Lars have nothing better to do on such a day than to sit here doing nothing?"" Lars stretched and asked why she had said that, so she told him what was going on up at the castle. Lars thought that he was just as good as anyone else, so he meandered up there himself. When the king saw Lazy Lars approaching the castle he thought that they could surely begin now, because certainly Lars would be the last one to arrive, even though he lived closest. They put a golden apple in the little prince's hand, and the one to whom he would give the apple, he would be the father. The child walked slowly back and forth with the golden apple among the many people, as though he did not know what he should do with it. Finally he caught sight of Lars, who was standing at the very back of the crowd with his hands in his pockets. He walked toward Lars and reached the apple to him. Lars, in no hurry, slowly removed his hand from his pocket and took the apple. But then there came a huge uproar, so angry were the people -- large and small, poor and rich -- at Lars's good fortune. ""Yes,"" they said, ""those who can neither read nor write have all the luck."" Lars was nearly trampled by the envious mob, but he held the apple tightly and finally made his way to the king, the queen, and all the ministers. When the king saw that it was Lazy Lars who had received the apple, he discovered that this final embarrassment was even worse than the first one. He took the princess, pushed her toward him, and said that he never wanted to see anything of them in his house again. If it had been a handsome gentleman then everything would have been all right, but Lazy Lars --! The king ordered his people to put Lars and the princess and the child into a boat on the sea east of the castle. They could set their own course and travel to whatever country they might choose. The king's order was carried out, and Lars and the princess were set adrift on the wild sea. They did not know which direction they were going. Evening came, and the princess cried pitifully. Lars, however, was lying on the bottom of the boat thinking only of himself, for this was the first time he had ever had water beneath him, and he was not up to a voyage at sea. ""What should we do?"" cried the princess. ""Tell me, Lars, what should we do?"" ""Yes, what should be do?"" answered Lars. ""I don't know what we should do."" And so they sailed on. After a while the princess said, ""Say something, you Lazy Lars. You just lie there without saying a word."" ""What should I say then?"" mumbled Lars. ""The only thing I can say is that I wish we would soon be on land!"" He had scarcely uttered this wish when there was suddenly before them, a beautiful island with woods and houses and people and cattle. The princess was very happy that Lars had finally opened his mouth, and she thought that everything would now be quite simple, since he was able to wish so well. She would only have to put the words into his mouth, and he would utter the wish. First of all he would have to wish that he were a normal human being and not the lazy beast that he had been up until now. Then he would have to wish for a beautiful castle with everything that went with it. He had scarcely uttered these wishes when suddenly new life came into Lars, and in the middle of the island there stood a beautiful castle, shimmering like bright gold. Then Lars had to wish for splendid clothing, carriages and horses, soldiers, and much more; and suddenly it was all at hand. -- Yes, the princess knew exactly what she wanted. The next morning after the king had gotten up, he went, as usual, to the window to look out over the sea. He had always liked to do this. There he saw a beautiful island east of his royal castle. On it was a castle that shimmered like bright gold. Could he trust his old eyes? No. He took a pair of spectacles and looked again. Yes, the island and the castle were still there, and that was more than the old king could comprehend. He called his people and asked if until now they had ever seen anything of this before. They too opened their eyes wide and thought that the devil himself had done this to make fools of them, for previously there had no more been an island there than there are roses on a manure pile. To assure himself the king had a ship made ready, and with his people he sailed over to the island. When he arrived on land, a row of soldiers was there, extending from the shore up to the castle. They presented arms to the old king, which pleased him greatly. When the old king and his people finally arrived at the castle, his daughter approached them smiling. She fell at his feet and begged him to accept the two of them into his grace, promising that they would be obedient children. The king was amazed, and his daughter had to tell him everything that had happened. She told him how she had been punished for having lightheartedly ridiculed Lazy Lars without considering that there might be some good in him after all. But it was good that everything had happened, for now she would not want anyone but Lars. He was no longer the way he had been before. New life had come into him. Then Lars came out, and in his beautiful clothing he looked as stately as a prince. He confirmed what the princess had said, and he also asked the king for mercy. All's well that ends well,"" said the king. We live in a strange world, but whosoever should be together, will be together. So everything was in order. They celebrated their wedding for many days, and they lived happily together. And when the old king died Lars became king and ruled many years with his queen.",Denmark,"Source: Klara Stroebe, ""Der faule Lars, der die Prinzessin bekam,"" Nordische Volksmärchen. 1.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Peruonto,"A countrywoman of Casoria, by the name of Ceccarella, had a son named Peruonto, who was the silliest body and the ugliest lump of flesh that nature had ever created; so that the unhappy mother always felt sad at heart, and cursed the day and the hour upon which she had given birth to this good-for-nothing, who was not worth a dog's hide. The unfortunate woman could cry out as much as she liked, but the ass never stirred to do her the lightest service. At last, after screaming herself hoarse, and assailing him with all the epithets she could think of, she induced him to go to the forest and gather a fagot of wood, saying, ""It is nearly time that we should have something to eat. Run for this wood, that I may get ready somewhat: and forget not yourself on the way, but come back at once, that I may cook the needful so as to keep the life in us."" Peruonto departed, and fared on like a monk among his brethren in a procession. Away he went, stepping as one treading down eggs, with the gait of a jackdaw, counting his paces as he went. At last he reached a certain part of the forest through which ran a streamlet, and nearby he saw three young girls lying on the grass, with a stone for a pillow, fast asleep, with the sun pouring its rays straight upon them. When Peruonto saw them, like a fountain amid a roaring fire, he took compassion upon them; and with the ax which he carried to cut the wood he severed some branches from the trees, and built a kind of arbor over them. Whilst he was busy so doing the young girls awoke (they were the daughters of a fairy), and perceiving the kindness and goodness of heart of Peruonto, in gratitude they gave him a charm, by which he might possess whatever he knew how to ask for. Peruonto, having performed this action, continued faring towards the forest, where he cut down a fagot of wood so large that it would require a cart to carry it. Seeing that it would be impossible for him to lift it, he sat upon it, saying, ""Would it not be a fine thing if only this fagot would carry me home?"" And behold, the fagot began to trot like a Besignano horse, and arriving before the king's palace, it began to wheel round, and prance, and curvet, so that Peruonto cried out aloud, enough to deafen all hearers. The young ladies who attended the king's daughter, whose name was Vastolla, happening to look out of the window and behold this marvel, hastened to call the princess, who, glancing out and observing the tricks played by the fagot, laughed until she fell backwards, which thing was unusual, and the young ladies were astonished at the sight, as the Lady Vastolla was by nature so melancholy that they never remembered to have seen her smile. Peruonto lifted his head, and perceiving that they were mocking him, said, ""O Vastolla, may you be with child by me!"" and thus saying, tightened his heels on the fagot, which at once moved away, and in an instant arrived home with a train of screaming children behind; and if his mother had not quickly shut the door, they would have slain him with stones. In the meantime Vastolla, after a feeling of uneasiness, and unrest, and the delay of her monthly period, perceived that she was with child, and hid as long as possible her plight, until she was round as a cask. The king, discovering her condition, was exceedingly angry, and fumed, and swore terrible oaths, and convened a meeting of the council, and thus spoke to them: '""You all know that the moon of my honor is wearing horns, and you all know that my daughter has furnished matter of which to write chronicles, or, even better, to chronicle my shame. You all know that to adorn my brow she has filled her belly; therefore tell me, advise me what I had better do. Methinks I had rather have her slain than have her give birth to a bastard race. I have a mind to let her feel rather the agonies of death than the labor of childbed. I have a mind to let her depart this world ere she bring bad seed into it."" The ministers and advisers, who had made use of more oil than vinegar, answered him, saying, ""Truly she deserves a great punishment, and of the horns which she forces on your brow should the handle be made of the knife that shall slay her; but if we slay her now that she is with child, the villain who has been the principal cause of your disgust, and who has dressed you with horns right and left will escape unhurt. Let us await, therefore, until it comes to port, and then we are likely to know the root of this dishonor; and afterwards we will think and resolve, with a grain of salt, which course we should best follow."" The king was pleased with this advice, perceiving in it sound sense, and therefore held his hand, and said, ""Let us await the issue of events."" As heaven willed, the time came, and with little labor, at the first sound of the midwife's voice, and the first squeeze of the body, out sprang two male children like two golden apples. The king, who was full of wrath, sent for his ministers and counselors, and said to them, ""My daughter has been brought to bed, and the time has come for her to die."" The old sages answered (and all to gain time upon time), ""No, we will wait until the children get older, so as to be able by their favor to recognize their father."" The king, not desiring his counselors to think him unjust, shrugged his shoulders and took it quietly, and patiently waited until the children were seven years of age, at which time he again sent for his counselors, and asked them for their advice. One of them said, ""As you have not been able to know from your daughter who was the false coiner that altered the crown from your image, it is time that we seek to obliterate the stain. Command that a great banquet should be prepared, and ask all the grandees and noblemen of the city, and let us be watchful, and seek with our own eyes him to whom the children incline most by the inclination of nature, for that one without fail will be the father, and we will at once get hold of him like goat's excrement."" The king was pleased with this advice. He gave orders for the banquet, invited all folk of any consequence, and after they had eaten their fill he asked them to stand in line and pass before the children, but they took as much notice of them as did Alexander's steed of the rabbits, so that the king became enraged and bit his lips with anger, and although he was not wanting in shoes, because of the tightness of those he was compelled to wear he stamped the ground with the excess of pain. His advisers said to him, ""Softly, your majesty! Take heart. We will give another banquet in a short while, no more inviting the noblest of the land, but instead folk of the lower class, as women often attach themselves to the worst: and perchance we will meet with the seed of your wrath amid cutlers, comb-sellers, and other merchants of small wares, as we have not met with him among the noble and well-born."" The king was pleased with this advice, and commanded the second banquet to be prepared, whereto came, by invited by a summons, all folk from Chiaja, all the rogues, all adventurers and fortune-hunters, all quick-witted, all ruffians, and villains, and apron-wights that were to be found in the city, who, taking seat like unto noblemen at a long table spread with rich abundance, began straightway to stuff themselves. Now it so happened that Ceccarella, having heard the ban which invited folk to this banquet, began to urge Peruonto to go to it also, and so much did she say and do that at last she prevailed upon him to depart, and he went. He had hardly entered the place of feasting, when the two pretty children ran to him, and embraced him, and received him with great joy, and sported and played with him. The king, beholding this sight, pulled out his own beard, seeing that the winning ticket of this lottery had fallen to an ugly brute, the sight of whom made one sick. He was shaggy-headed, owl-eyed, had a nose like a parrot's beak, and a mouth like a fish. He was so tattered and torn, that no part of his body was hidden. Sighing heavily, the king said, ""Has ever any one seen anything like this, that that light-o'-brains daughter mine should have it in her head to fall in love with this sea-monster? Has ever any one seen one that could take to the heel of such a hairy foot? Ah, infamous woman, what blind and false metamorphoses are these: to become a strumpet for a pig, so that I should become a ram? But what am I waiting for? What am I thinking of? Let them feel the weight of my just chastisement. Let them be punished as they deserve, and let them bear the penalty that you will adjudge. Take them out of my sight, for I cannot endure them."" The ministers all took counsel together, and resolved that the princess and the malefactor, with the two children, should be put into a cask and thrown into the sea, so that they should thus end their days without the king soiling his hands with his own blood. No sooner was the sentence pronounced than the cask was brought, and all four were put therein; but before they were thrown in, some of the handmaidens of Princess Vastolla, who were weeping bitterly, put inside the hogshead raisins and dried figs, so that they could live for a little time. Then the cask was closed, and taken away, and flung into the sea, and it kept sailing on wherever the wind blew it. Meanwhile Vastolla, weeping with sore weeping, her eyes running two streamlets of tears, said to Peruonto, ""What great misfortune is ours that our grave should be Bacchus' cradle! Oh, could I but have known who it was that worked in this body to have me thrown into this prison! Alas! I have come to a sad end, without knowing the why or wherefore. O you cruel one, tell me, tell me, what magic art did you use, what wand did thou wave, to bring me to this pass, to be shut herein by this hogshead's hoops? Tell me, tell me, what devil tempted you to put into me the invisible pipe, and gain nothing by it but this dark spectacle? Peruonto, who had for a time listened and pretended not to hear, answered at last, ""If thou want know how it came to pass, give me some raisins and figs."" The princess, desiring to draw from him something, gave him a handful of each; and as soon as he had eaten them, he began to recount all that had happened to him with the three young girls and the fagot of wood, and how at last he had passed under her window, and how, when she laughed at him, he wished her to be with child by him. When the lady Vastolla heard this, she took heart, and said to him, ""Why should we make exit of life inside this hogshead? Why not wish for this vessel to become a splendid ship, so that we may escape from this peril and arrive in good port?' Peruonto answered, ""Give me some figs and raisins, if you want this to happen."" Vastolla at once satisfied his gluttony, so that he should be willing to speak, and like a carnival fisherwoman, with the raisins and figs she fished for the words fresh out of his body. Peruonto said the words desired by the princess, and at once the cask became a ship, with all the sails ready for sailing, and with all the sailors that were needed for the ship's service; and there were to be seen some lowering the sheets, some hauling the shrouds, some holding the rudder, some setting the studding-sails, some mounting to the upper-main-topsail, one crying, ""Put the ship about!"" and another, ""Put the helm up!"" and one blowing the trumpet, and others firing the guns, and some doing one thing, and some another, so long as Vastolla remained on board the ship, swimming in a sea of sweetness. It was now the hour when the moon played with the sun at going and coming, and Vastolla said to Peruonto, ""Handsome youth of mine, wish that this ship may become a palace, so that we may be more secure. You know the proverb, 'Praise the sea, but dwell on shore.'"" Peruonto answered, ""If you want this to happen, give me some figs and raisins,"" and she at once gave him what he asked for. Peruonto, having eaten, wished his wish, and the ship became a beautiful palace, adorned in all points, and furnished with such splendor that nothing was wanting. So that the princess, who would have parted with life easily but a short time before, now would not have exchanged her place with the highest lady in the world, seeing that she was served and entreated as a queen. Then, to put a seal, upon her good fortune, she begged Peruonto to obtain the grace of becoming handsome and polished, so that they could be happy together, for although the proverb says, ""Better a pig for a husband than an emperor for a friend,"" if he could change his looks she would take it as the greatest good fortune. Peruonto once again answered, ""Give me some figs and raisins, if you want this to happen,"" Vastolla at once responded with the raisins and figs, so that as soon as the wish was spoken he became from a sparrow a bullfinch, from a ghoul a narcissus, and from a hideous mask a handsome youth. Vastolla, seeing such a transformation, was beside herself with joy, and throwing her arms around him, tasted the sweet juice of happiness. Now it so happened that at this same time the king, who from the day on which he had pronounced the cruel sentence had not lifted his eyes from the ground, was entreated to go hunting by his courtiers, who though thus to cheer him up. He went, but was surprised by nightfall. Sighting from afar a light from a lantern at one of the windows of the palace, he sent one of his followers to see if they would receive him there, and he was answered that he could shelter there for the night. The king accepted the invitation, and mounting the steps, entered, and going from room to room, he could see no person living except the two children, who kept at his side, saying, ""Grandfather! grandfather! grandfather!"" The king wondered with greatest wonder, and marveled with greatest marvel. Being wearied, he seated himself by a table, when he beheld spread on it by invisible hands a white cloth and divers dishes of food, of which he partook, and wines of good vintage, of which he drank truly as a king, served by the two pretty children, never ceasing: and whilst he was eating, a band of musicians played beautifully, touching even the marrow of his bones. When he was finished eating, a bed suddenly appeared made of cloth of gold; and having had his boots pulled off, he took his rest, and all his courtiers did the same, after having eaten well at a hundred tables, which had been made ready in other rooms. As soon as morning came, the king got ready to depart, and was going to take with him also the little ones, when Vastolla and her husband appeared, and falling at his feet, asked his pardon, and recounted to him all their fortune. The king, seeing that he had won two grandsons that were like two grains of gold and two priceless gems, and a son-in-law like a jinn, embraced first one and then the other, and took them with him to the city, and commanded great festivals and rejoicings to be made for this great gain, which lasted many days, solemnly confessing to himself that ""Man proposes, but God disposes.""

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Peter the Fool,"In the Ligurian Sea there is an island called Capraia, which, at the time I am describing, was ruled by King Luciano. Amongst his subjects was a poor widow named Isotta, who lived with her only son Peter, a fisher lad. But from Peter's fishing she would scarce have kept body and soul together, for he was a poor silly creature known to all the neighbors as Peter the Fool. Though he went fishing every day he never caught anything, but in spite of his ill success he would always come up from his boat shouting and bellowing so that all the town might hear him, ""Mother, mother, bring out your tubs and your buckets and your pails. Bring them out all, great and small, for Peter has caught a boatful of fish."" The poor woman soon got to know the value of Peter's bragging, but in spite of this she always prepared the vessels, only to find herself jeered at by the silly youth, who, as soon as he came near, would thrust out his long tongue in ridicule, and otherwise mock at her. Now it chanced that the widow's cottage stood just opposite to the palace of King Luciano, who had only one child, a pretty graceful girl about ten years old, Luciana by name. She, it happened, was looking out of the window of the palace one day when Peter came back from fishing, crying out to his mother to bring out her tubs and her buckets and her pails to hold the fish with which he was laden, and so much was she diverted at the silly antics of the fool, that it seemed likely she would die with laughing. Peter, when he saw that he was made sport of, grew very angry, and threw some ugly words at her, but the more he raged the more she -- after the manner of willful children -- laughed and made mock at him. Peter, however, went on with his fishing day after day, and played the same trick on his mother every evening on his return. But at last fortune favored him, and he caught a fine tunny, very big and fat. Overjoyed at his good luck, he began to shout and cry out over and over again, ""Mother and I will have a good supper tonight,"" when, to his amazement, he heard the tunny which he had just caught begin to speak, ""Ah! My dear brother, I pray you of your courtesy to give me my life. When once you have eaten me, what farther benefit do you think you will get from me? But if you will let me live there is no telling what service I may not render you."" But Peter, whose thoughts just then were set only on his supper, hoisted the fish on his shoulders and set off homewards. But the tunny still kept on beseeching his captor to spare his life, promising him first as many fish as he could want, and finally to do him any favor he might demand. Peter was not hardhearted, and, though a fool, fancied he might profit by sparing the fish, so he listened to the tunny's petition and threw him back into the sea. The fish, sensible of Peter's kindness, and not wishing to seem ungrateful, told Peter to get into his boat again and tilt it over so that the water could run in. This advice Peter at once followed, and, having leant over on one side, he let the boat be half filled with water, which brought in with it such a huge quantity of fish that the boat was in danger of sinking. Peter was well nigh beside himself with joy when be saw what had happened, and, when he had taken as many fish as he could carry, he betook himself homewards, crying out, as was his wont, when he drew near to the cottage, ""Mother, mother, bring out your tubs and your buckets and your pails. Bring out them all, great and small, for Peter has caught a boatful of fish."" At first poor Isotta, thinking that he was only playing his old fool's game, took no heed. But at last, hearing him cry out louder than ever, and fearing that he might commit some greater folly if he should not find the vessels prepared as usual, got them all ready. What was her surprise to see her simpleton of a son at last coming back with a brave spoil! The Princess Luciana was at the palace window, and hearing Peter bellowing louder than ever, she laughed louder than ever, so that Peter was almost mad with rage, and having left his fish, he rushed back to the seashore, and called aloud on the tunny to come and help him. The fish, hearing Peter's voice, came to the marge of the shore, and putting his nose up out of the waves, asked what service was required of him. ""What service!"" cried Peter. ""Why I would that Luciana, that saucy minx, the daughter of our king, should find herself with child at once."" What followed was a proof that the tunny had. not made an empty promise to Peter, for before many days had passed the figure of the young girl, who was not twelve years old, began to show signs of maternity. Her mother, when she marked this, fell into great trouble, but she could not believe that a child of eleven could be pregnant, and rather set down the swelling to the working of an incurable disease; so she brought Luciana to be examined by some women expert in such cases, and these, as soon as they saw the girl, declared that she was certainly with child. The queen, overwhelmed by this terrible news, told it also to the king, and he, when he heard it, cried aloud for death rather than such ignominy. Strict inquisition was made to discover who could have violated the child, but nothing was found out; so Luciano, to hide her dire disgrace, determined to have his daughter secretly killed. The queen, on hearing this, begged her husband to spare the unfortunate Luciana till the child should be born, and then do with her what he would. The king, moved with compassion for his only daughter, gave way so far; and in due time Luciana was delivered of a boy so fine and beautiful that the king could no longer harbor the thought of putting them away, but, on the other hand, gave order to the queen that the boy should be well tended till he was a year old. When this time was completed the child had become beautiful beyond compare, and then it came into the king's mind that he would again make a trial to find out who the father might be. He issued a proclamation that every man in the city who had passed fourteen years should, under pain of losing his head, present himself at the palace bearing in his hand some fruit or flower which might attract the child's attention. On the appointed day, in obedience to the proclamation, all those summoned came to the palace, bearing, this man one thing and that man another, and, having passed before the king, sat down according to their rank. Now it happened that a certain young man as he was betaking himself to the palace met Peter, and said to him, ""Peter, why are you not going to the palace like all the others to obey the order of the king?"" ""What should I do in such a crowd as that?"" said Peter. ""Cannot you see I am a poor naked fellow, and have hardly a rag to my back, and yet you ask me to push myself in amongst all those gentlemen and courtiers? No."" Then the young man, laughing at him, said, ""Come with me, and I will give you a coat. Who knows whether the child may not turn out to be yours?"" In the end Peter let himself be persuaded to go to the young man's house, and having put on a decent coat, they went together to the palace. But when they arrived there Peter's heart again failed him, and he hid himself behind a door. By this time all the men had presented themselves to the king, and were seated in the hall. Then Luciano commanded the nurse to bring in the child, thinking that if the father should be there the sense of paternity would make him give some sign. As the nurse carried the child down the hall everyone, as he passed, began to caress him and to give him, this one a fruit and that one a flower; but the infant, with a wave of his hand, refused them all. When the nurse passed by the entrance door the child began to laugh and crow, and threw himself forward so lustily that he almost jumped out of the woman's arms, but she, not knowing that anyone was there, walked on down the hall. When she came back to the same place the child was more delighted than ever, laughing and pointing with his finger to the door; so that the king, who had already noticed the child's actions, called to the nurse and asked her who was behind the door. The nurse, being somewhat confused, said that surely some beggar must be hidden there. By the king's command Peter was at once haled forth, and everybody recognized the town fool. But the child, who was close to him, stretched out his arms and clasped Peter round the neck and kissed him lovingly. The king, recognizing the sign, was stricken to the heart with grief, and having discharged the assembly, commanded that Peter and Luciana and the child should be put to death forthwith. The queen, though assenting to this doom, was fearful lest the public execution of the victims might draw down upon the king the anger of the people; so she persuaded him to have made a huge cask into which the three might be put and cast into the sea to drift at random. Then, at least, no one might witness their dying agony. This the king agreed to; and when the cask was made, the condemned ones were put therein, with a basket of bread and a flask of wine, and a drum of figs for the child, and thrust out into the rough sea, with the expectation that the waves would soon dash it to pieces against the rocks. But this was not to be their fate. Peter's poor old mother, when she heard of her son's misfortune, died of grief in a few days; and the unhappy Luciana, tossed about by the cruel waves, and seeing neither sun nor moon, would have welcomed a similar fate. The child, since she had no milk to give it, had to be soothed to sleep with now and then a fig. But Peter seemed to care for nothing, and ate the bread and drank the wine steadily, laughing the while. ""Alas! alas!"" cried Luciana in despair. ""You care nothing for this evil which you have brought upon me, a poor innocent girl. You eat and drink and laugh without a thought of the danger around us. ""Why,"" replied Peter, ""this misfortune is more your own fault than mine. If you had not mocked me so, it would never have happened. But do not lose heart. Our troubles will soon be over."" ""I believe that,"" cried Luciana, ""for the cask will soon be split on a rock, and then we must all be drowned."" ""No, no,"" said Peter."" Calm yourself. I have a secret, and were you to know what it is, you would be vastly surprised and vastly delighted too, I believe."" ""What secret can you know,"" said Luciana, ""which will avail us in such danger as this?"" ""I will soon tell you,"" Peter replied. ""I have a faithful servant, a great fish, who will do me any service I ask of him, and there is nothing he cannot do. I may as well tell you it was through his working that you became with child."" ""That I cannot believe,"" said Luciana. And what may this fish of yours be called?"" ""His name is Signor Tunny,"" replied Peter. ""Then,"" said Luciana, ""to put your fish to the test, I will ask you to transfer to me the power you exercise over him, and to command him to do my bidding instead of yours."" ""Be it as you will,"" said Peter; and without more ado he called the tunny, who at once rose up near the cask, whereupon Peter commanded him to do everything that Luciana might require of him. She at once exercised her power over the fish by ordering him to make the waves cast the cask ashore in a fair safe cleft in the rocks on an island, a short sail from her father's kingdom. As soon as the fish had worked her will so far, she laid other and much harder tasks upon him. One was to change Peter from the ugly fool that he was into a clever, handsome gallant. Another was to have built for her forthwith a rich and sumptuous palace with lofty halls and chambers and girt with carven terraces. Within the court there was to be laid out a beautiful garden, full of trees which should bear, instead of fruit, pearls and precious stones, and in the midst of it two fountains, one of the freshest water and the other of the finest wine. All these wonders were wrought by the fish almost as soon as Luciana had spoken. Now all this time the king and the queen were in deep misery in thinking of the cruel death they had contrived for Luciana and her child, how they had given their own flesh and blood to be eaten by the fishes. Therefore, to find some solace in their woe, they determined to go to Jerusalem and to visit the Holy Land. So they ordered a ship to be put in order for them, and furnished with all things suited to their state. They set sail with a favoring wind, and before they had gone a hundred miles they came in sight of an island upon which they could see a stately palace, built a little above the level of the sea. Seeing that this palace was so fair and sumptuous, and standing, moreover, within Luciano's kingdom, they were seized with a longing to view it more closely. So, having put into a haven, they landed on the island. Before they had come to the palace Luciana and Peter saw and recognized them, and, having gone forth to meet them, greeted them with a cordial welcome, but the king and queen did not know their hosts for the great change which had come over them. The guests were taken first into the palace, which they examined in every part, praising loudly its great beauty, and then they were led by a secret staircase into the garden, the splendor of which pleased them so amazingly that they swore they had never at any time before looked upon a place so delightful. In the center of this garden there stood a noble tree, which bore on one of its branches three golden apples. These the keeper of the garden was charged to guard jealously against robbers, and now, by some secret working which I cannot unravel, the finest of these apples was transported into the folds of the king's robe about his bosom, and there hidden. Luciano and the queen were about to take their leave when the keeper approached and said to Luciana, ""Madam, the most beautiful of the three golden apples is missing, and I can find no trace of the thief."" Luciana forthwith gave orders that the whole household should be searched, one by one, for such a loss as this was no light matter. The keeper, after he had searched thoroughly everyone, came back and told Luciana that the apple was nowhere to be found. At these words Luciana fell into great confusion, and, turning to the king, said, ""Your majesty must not be wroth with me if I ask that even you allow yourself to be searched, for I prize the golden apple that is lost almost as highly as my life."" The king, unsuspicious of any trick, and sure of his innocence, straightway loosened his robe, and lo! the golden apple fell from it to the ground. The king stood as one dazed, ignorant as to how the golden apple could have come into his robe, and Luciana spoke, ""Sire, we have welcomed you to our house with all the worship fitting to your rank, and now, as a recompense, you would privily rob our garden of its finest fruit. Meseems you have proved yourself very ungrateful."" The king, in his innocence, attempted to prove to her that he could not have taken the apple, and Luciana, seeing his confusion, knew that the time had come for her to speak, and reveal herself to her father. ""My lord,"" she said, with the tears in her eyes, ""I am Luciana, your hapless daughter, whom you sentenced to a cruel death along with my child and Peter the fisher boy. Though I bore a child, I was never unchaste. Here is the boy, and here is he whom men were wont to call Peter the Fool. You wonder at this change. It has all been brought about by the power of a marvelous fish whose life Peter spared when he had caught it in his net. By this power Peter has been turned into the wisest of men, and the palace you see has been built. In the same way I became pregnant without knowledge of a man, and the golden apple was conveyed into the folds of your robe. I am as innocent of unchastity as you are of theft."" When the king heard these words his eyes were opened, and he knew his child. Then, weeping with joy, they embraced each other, and all were glad and happy. After spending a few days on the island, they all embarked and returned together to Capraia, where with sumptuous feastings and rejoicings Peter was duly married to Luciana, and lived with her in great honor and contentment, until Luciano died, and then he became king in his stead.",Giovanni Francesco Straparola,"Source: Giovanni Francesco Straparola, The Facetious Nights of Straparola: The Italian Novelists, translated into English by W.

The Fool Whose Wishes All Came True,0675,Stupid Michel,"Finally she decided that she would have to send him out into the world, so she said to him, ""Michel, go out to the pond and fetch some water."" ""Yes,"" said Michel, ""but just where is the pond?"" ""Go out the front door, walk down the garden path, and you will see it to the left."" Michel set forth at once and actually found the front door, the garden path, and the pond. When he pulled the bucket from the pond a large pike jumped out of it, and asked Michel to throw him back into the water, and he would reward him greatly. ""Did I tell you to jump out of the bucket?"" asked Michel. ""You can jump back into the water by yourself!"" The pike continued to beg, finally promising Michel that all his wishes would come true if he would throw him back into the water. Michel did just that, then picked up the bucket and returned home. Now while at the pond in the distance he had seen a house that glistened magnificently like pure silver and gold, so he asked his mother, ""Mother, what kind of a house is the one that I saw from the pond?"" His mother said, ""That is the king's house. He lives there with the beautiful princess."" When Michel heard that a beautiful princess lived there, he thought, ""I will see if the pike told me the truth. I wish that the princess should become pregnant."" Not long afterward the princess did indeed become pregnant, and when the king discovered this he became very angry and reprimanded her bitterly. But she swore sincerely that no one had been with her; it must have happened while she was asleep. However, the kind did not believe her. With time she gave birth to a boy, and because the father's name was not known, he was named after his grandfather. When the boy grew older he noticed that his grandfather was not his father, and he asked, ""Tell me, who is my father?"" The grandfather answered, ""You do not have a father."" ""How can I not have a father?"" replied the boy. ""Everyone has a father. You just don't know who mine is!"" Then the old king had to admit that he did have a father, but that no one knew who he was. Then the boy said, ""Let's give a large feast, and I'll find out who he is."" The king did just that, and all the ministers, generals, and such people within the king's realm came, and the boy mingled among them, carefully looking at each one. Finally he went back to the king and said, ""My father is not here. You will have to give a larger feast."" So the king invited all of his officers and councilors and even some of the most prominent citizens to come together, and once the boy mingled among them, examining each one. But he did not find his father, and he said to the king, ""You must give a feast for everyone, and then I will find my father."" Then all the citizens and peasants from the entire land were invited to come together. When Michel's mother heard about this she said, ""Michel, you too must go to the castle. The king is giving a general feast."" Now Michel had only a dirty, tarry jacket and an old three-cornered hat, but his mother made him look as good as possible, and he went to the court. After everyone had gathered together in a large group, the boy ran quickly among them, and before long he stopped next to Michel in his tarry jacket and three-cornered hat. Taking Michel by the hand, the boy led him to the king and said, ""This is my father!"" At first the king did not want to believe this, and he told the boy that he must be mistaken, but the boy insisted that Michel was his father. Finally, beside himself with anger, the king said that he would neither accept the father, nor the mother, nor the child. Forthwith he had a large glass ball made with a lid that one could open and close. He had his daughter, Michel, and the boy put inside, then set it adrift on the open sea. After they had drifted for some distance, with the princess sitting there bemoaning the fact that they had found such a father for her child, and that now they would miserably perish, Michel wished that they would come ashore on an island, and immediately the ball hit solid ground, and they all climbed out safely. Then Michel wished for a magnificent castle with the best servants and all the houses that belonged to such a place, and immediately everything was there. Now the princess was happier. Then Michel wished magnificent clothes for himself. Thus he lived here happily with his wife and his child for a long time. Finally the princess grew lonely for her father and her homeland, and she told this to her husband, so he wished for a bridge to her father's kingdom, and immediately one was there, and indeed it had one railing of gold and the other of silver. Then they flew across the water in a golden coach to her father's castle. His anger disappeared when he discovered how well off his daughter now was, and they all lived happily and satisfied until they died.",Germany,"Source: Adalbert Kuhn, ""Der dumme Michel,"" M�rkische Sagen und Märchen (Berlin: G.

Forgiveness and Redemption,0756,Tannhäuser,"Noble Tannhäuser, a German knight, had traveled through many lands. He even visited the beautiful women of the Mountain of Lady Venus, hoping to see what great miracles occurred there. After sojourning there for a while, with joy and contentment, his conscience finally directed him to return to the world, and he asked to take leave. Lady Venus, however, tempted him with whatever it might take to make him change his mind. She offered him one of her comrades for a wife, pointing out her red lips that never ceased smiling. Tannhäuser answered that he desired no woman other than the one he was now thinking of, nor did he want to burn forever in hell. He was not interested in the red lips. He did not want to stay here any longer, for to do so would destroy his life. Then the she-devil tried to lure him into her room, tempting him with love, but the noble night cursed her loudly, calling upon the Heavenly Virgin to help him escape. Filled with remorse, he set forth toward Rome in order to confess his sins to Pope Urban, and thus do penance to save his soul. However, after he confessed that he had remained an entire year with Lady Venus in her mountain, the Pope said: ""Not until leaves begin to grow on this dry stick that I am holding in my hand, will your sins will be forgiven!"" Tannhäuser said: ""Had I but had only one more year to live, I would have shown remorse and done penance such that God would have taken mercy on me."" Grieving that the Pope had cursed him, he left the city and returned to the demonic mountain, intending to stay there forever and ever. Lady Venus welcomed him as one welcomes a long absent lover. Three days later leaves began to grow on the stick, and the Pope sent messengers throughout the country, attempting to discover where Tannhäuser had gone. But it was too late. He was inside the mountain and had chosen a lover. There he will remain until Judgment Day, at which time God may send him to a different place.

Forgiveness and Redemption,0756,The Woman Who Had No Shadow,"Once there was a pastor's wife who was afraid to have children. Other women are concerned when they have no children, but she was constantly afraid that she could have children. One day she went to a wise woman, a wicked witch, and asked her what to do to avoid having children. The wise woman gave her seven stones and told her if she would throw them into the well she would be spared from having children. The pastor's wife threw the stones into the well. As each stone splashed below, she thought that she heard the cry of a child, but still she felt a great sense of relief. Some time later the pastor and his wife were walking across the churchyard by the light of a full moon, when the pastor suddenly noticed that his wife did not have a shadow. This frightened him, and he asked her for an explanation, stating that she must have committed a dreadful sin, a sin that she would have to confess to him. He continued to press her for a confession, until finally she admitted what she had done. Upon hearing her story, he angrily proclaimed, ""Cursed woman! Flowers will grow from our slate roof before God forgives you of this sinful deed!"" With that he sent her away, telling her to never again step across his threshold. One night, many years later, a wretched and tattered beggar woman approached the parsonage and asked for shelter. The housekeeper gave the poor woman a bit to eat and made a bed for her next to the kitchen stove. The next morning the pastor found the beggar woman dead on the kitchen floor. In spite of her rags, he recognized her immediately as the woman he had cursed and disowned. As he stood there contemplating her lifeless, but serene face, his housekeeper burst into the room.

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Crow and the Swan,"There was a crow that lived on the refuse of the dishes set before those well-behaved young children of the Vaicya. Those Vaicya children always gave the crow meat and curds, and milk, and sugared milk with rice, and honey, and butter. Thus fed with the refuse of their dishes by the young children of that Vaicya, the crow became arrogant and came to disregard all birds that were equal to him or even superior. It chanced that on a time certain swans of cheerful hearts, of great speed and capable of going everywhere at will and equal unto Garuda himself in range and speed of flight, came to that side of the ocean. The Vaicya boys, beholding those swans, addressed the crow and said, ""O ranger of the skies, thou art superior to all winged creatures!"" Deceived by those children of little understanding, that oviparous creature, from folly and pride, regarded their words to be true. Proud of the refuse of the children's dishes upon which he fed, the crow then, alighting in the midst of those swans capable of traversing great distances, desired to enquire as to who amongst them was their leader. The foolish crow at last challenged him amongst those birds of tireless wings whom he regarded their leader, saying, ""Let us compete in flight!"" Hearing those words of the raving crow, the swans that had been assembled there, those foremost of birds endued with great strength, began to laugh. The swans then, that were capable of going everywhere at will, addressed the crow, saying, ""We are swans, having our abode in the Manasa lake. We traverse the whole earth, and amongst winged creatures we are always applauded for the length of the distances we traverse! Being, as thou art, only a crow, how canst thou, O fool, challenge a swan endued with might, capable of going everywhere at will, and doing large distances in course of his flight? Tell us, O crow, how thou shalt fly with us!"" The boastful crow, in consequence of the foolishness of his species, repeatedly finding fault with the words of that swan, at last gave this answer. The crow said, ""I shall, without doubt, fly, displaying a hundred and one different kinds of motion! Doing every hundred Yojanas in a separate and beautiful kind of motion, I shall display all those motions! Rising up, and swooping down, and whirling around, and coursing straight, and proceeding gently, and advancing steadily, and performing the diverse courses up and down in a slanting direction, and floating still, and wheeling around, and receding back, and soaring high, and darting forward, and soaring upwards with fiercer velocity, and once more proceeding gently and then proceeding with great impetuosity, and once again swooping down and whirling around, and advancing steadily, and rising up and up by jerks, and soaring straight, and once more falling down, and wheeling in a circle, and rushing proudly, and diverse other kinds of motion, -- these all I shall display in the sight of all you! Ye shall then witness my strength! With one of these different kinds of motion I shall presently rise into the sky. Point out duly, ye swans, by which of these motions I shall course through space. Settling the kind of motion amongst yourselves, you will have to course with me. Adopting all those different motions, ye shall have to course with me through supportless space!"" The crow having said these words, one of the swans addressed him. The swan spoke, ""Thou, O crow, wilt doubtless fly the hundred and one different kinds of flight! I shall, however, fly in that one kind of motion that all other birds know, for I do not, O crow, know any other! As regards thee, O thou of red eyes, fly thou in any kind of course that thou likest!"" At these words, those crows that bad been assembled there laughed aloud, saying, ""How will the swan by only one kind of flight get the better of a hundred different kinds of flight?"" Then those two, viz., the swan and the crow, rose into the sky, challenging each other. Capable of going everywhere at will, the swan proceeded in one kind of motion, while the crow coursed in a hundred different kinds. And the swan flew and the crow also flew, causing each other to wonder at his skill and each speaking highly of his own achievements. Beholding the diverse kinds of flight at successive instants of time, the crows that were there were filled with great joy and began to caw more loudly. The swans also laughed in mockery, uttering many remarks disagreeable to the crows. And they began to soar and alight repeatedly, here and there. And they began to come down and rise up from tree-tops and the surface of the earth. And they uttered diverse cries indicative of their victory. The swan, however, with that one kind of slow motion with which he was familiar began to traverse the skies. For a moment, therefore, he seemed to yield to the crow. The crows, at this, disregarding the swans, said these words: ""That swan amongst you which has soared into the sky, is evidently yielding!"" Hearing these words, the soaring swan flew westwards with great velocity to the ocean. Then fear entered the heart of the crow who became almost senseless at not seeing any island or trees whereon to perch when tired. And the crow thought within his heart as to where he should alight when tired, upon that vast expanse of water. The ocean, being as it is the abode of countless creatures, is irresistible. Dwelt in by hundreds of monsters, it is grander than space. Nothing can exceed it in depth! Men know that the waters of the ocean are as limitless as space. For the extent of its waters, what is a crow to it? The swan, having traversed a great distance in a moment, looked back at the crow, and, though capable, could not leave him behind. Having transgressed the crow, the swan cast his eyes on him and waited, thinking, ""Let the crow come up."" The crow then, exceedingly tired, came up to the swan. Beholding him succumbing, and about to sink, and desirous of rescuing him in remembrance of the practices of good folks, the swan addressed him in these words: ""Thou hadst repeatedly spoken of many kinds of flight while speaking on the subject! Thou wouldst not speak of this, thy present motion, because of its having been a mystery to us? What is the name of this kind of flight, O crow, that thou hast now adopted? Thou touchest the waters with thy wings and beak repeatedly. Which amongst those diverse kinds of flight is this, O crow, that thou art now practicing? Come, come, quickly, O crow, for I am waiting for thee!"" Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the water with his wings and beak, the crow, beheld in that state by the swan, addressed the latter. Indeed, not seeing the limit of that watery expanse, and sinking down in fatigue, and exhausted with the effort of his flight, the crow said unto the swan, ""We are crows, we wander hither and thither, crying caw, caw! O swan, I seek thy protection, placing my life-breaths at thy hands! Oh, take me to the shores of the ocean!"" Exceedingly afflicted, and touching the ocean with his wings and beak, the crow, very much fatigued, suddenly fell down. Beholding him fallen upon the waters of the ocean with a melancholy heart, the swan, addressing the crow who was on the point of death, said these words: ""Remember, O crow, what thou hadst said in praise of thyself! Thy words even were that thou wouldst course through the sky in a hundred and one different kinds of flight. Thou, therefore, that wouldst fly a hundred different kinds of flight, thou that art superior to me, alas, why then art thou tired and fallen down on the ocean?"" Overcome with weakness, the crow then, casting his eyes upwards at the swan, and seeking to gratify him, replied, saying, ""Proud of the remains of others' dishes upon which I fed, I had, O swan, regarded myself as the equal of Garuda, and had disregarded all crows and many other birds! I now, however, seek thy protection and place my life-breaths at thy hands! Oh, take me to the shores of some island! If, O swan, I can, O lord, return in safety to my own country, I will never again disregard anybody! Oh, rescue me now from this calamity!"" Him that said so and was so melancholy and weeping and deprived of his senses, him that was sinking in the ocean, uttering cries of caw, caw, him so drenched by the water and so disgusting to look at and trembling with fear, the swan, without a word, took up with his feet and slowly caused to ride on his back. Having caused the crow whose senses had deserted him to ride upon his back, the swan quickly returned to that island whence thy had both flown, challenging each other. Placing down that ranger of the sky on dry land and comforting him, the swan, fleet as the mind, proceeded to the region he desired. Thus was that crow, fed on the remains of others' dinners, vanquished by the swan. The crow, then, casting off the pride of might and energy, adopted a life of peace and quiet.",The Mahabharata,"Source: The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (Calcutta: Bharata Press, 1889), pp. 141-45.",NA,"Edited, and slightly shortened by D.

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Fish That Were Too Clever,"Two fish lived in a pond. Their names were Satabuddhi (having the understanding of a hundred) and Sahasrabuddhi (having the understanding of a thousand). The two of them had a frog for a friend, whose name was Ekabuddhi (having the understanding of one). For a time they would enjoy friendly conversation on the bank, and then they would return to the water. One day when they had gathered for conversation, some fishermen came by just as the sun was setting. They were carrying nets in their hands and many dead fish on their heads. When the fishermen saw the pond, they said to one another, ""There seem to be a lot of fish in this pond, and the water is very low. Let us come back here tomorrow morning!"" After saying this, they went home. These words struck the three friends like a thunderbolt, and they took counsel with one another. The frog said, ""Oh, my dear Satabuddhi and Sahasrabuddhi, what shall we do? Should we flee, or stay here?"" Hearing this, Sahasrabuddhi laughed and said, ""Oh, my friend, don't be afraid of words alone! They probably will not come back. But even if they do come back, I will be able to protect myself and you as well, through the power of my understanding, for I know many pathways through the water."" After hearing this, Satabuddhi said, ""Yes, what Sahasrabuddhi says is correct, for one rightly says: Where neither the wind nor the sun's rays have found a way, intelligent understanding will quickly make a path. And also: Everything on earth is subject to the understanding of those with intelligence. Why should one abandon the place of one's birth that has been passed down from generation to generation, just because of words? We must not retreat a single step! I will protect you through the power of my understanding."" The frog said, ""I have but one wit, and it is advising me to flee. This very day I shall go with my wife to another pond."" After saying this, as soon as it was night, the frog went to another pond. Early the next day the fishermen came like servants of the god of death and spread their nets over the pond. All the fish, turtles, frogs, crabs, and other water creatures were caught in the nets and captured, also Satabuddhi and Sahasrabuddhi, although they fled, and through their knowledge of the various paths escaped for a while by swimming to and fro. But they too, together with their wives, fell into a net and were killed. That afternoon the fishermen happily set forth toward home. Because of his weight, one of them carried Satabuddhi on his head. They tied Sahasrabuddhi onto a string and dragged him along behind. The frog Ekabuddhi, who had climbed onto the bank of his pond, said to his wife, ""Look, dear! Mr. Hundred-Wit lies on someone's head, and Mr. Thousand-Wit is hanging from a string. But Mr. Single-Wit, my dear, is playing here in the clear water.""",The Panchatantra,"Source: Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen.

It is believed that even then the stories were already ancient. The tales' self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes the Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning ""court scholar.""

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Fox and His Bagful of Wits and the One-Witted Hedgehog,"I do not know how he managed it, but a fox one day got into a poultry yard, and there he ate his fill. Some time afterwards, going along to the poultry yard, the hedgehog met him. ""Where are you going, brother?"" ""I am going to eat my fill."" ""Surely you cannot get it just as you like."" ""Oh,"" he said, ""you just come with me, and I will show you. I know my way, and there is plenty for me and for you, and some to leave behind for another time."" The hedgehog, who was a wise old fellow, said to the fox, ""Now, be careful. Are you sure that the owners of the poultry yard will let you in again so easily?"" ""Don't you trouble,"" said the fox. ""I know my business. You just come with me."" And the hedgehog went with him. But the people of the poultry yard were not such fools as the fox had taken them for, and just where the fox had got in last time they had dug a deep pit, and into that the fox and the hedgehog tumbled. When they found themselves at the bottom of the pit, the hedgehog turned to the fox and said, ""Well, you clever fellow, is that the proper way to get into the poultry yard? Did I not warn you?"" ""What is the good of talking?"" replied the fox. ""We are here now, and we must see how to get out of it."" ""But you are so clever, and I am only a poor old fool."" ""Never mind. You were always a wise one. Can you help me?"" ""No,"" he said. ""I cannot help you. This sudden fall has upset me, and I feel queer and sick."" ""What,"" cried the fox. ""You are not going to be sick here. That is more than I can stand. Out you go!"" So he got hold of the hedgehog by the snout, and the hedgehog coiled himself up with his little paws into a little ball round the fox's mouth. The fox lifted up his head with a jerk and threw the little fellow out of the pit. As soon as he saw himself safely out of the pit, the little hedgehog, bending over the mouth of the pit, said, chuckling to the fox, ""Where is your wisdom, you fool? You boast that you have a bagful of wits, whilst it is I who get myself out of the pit, though I have only a little wit."" ""Oh,"" said the fox, whining, ""do have pity on me! You are such a clever old fellow. Help me out of it too."" ""Well, said the hedgehog, ""I will help you. Now, you pretend to be dead, and when the people come and find you stiff and stark, and a nasty smell about you, they will say, 'The fox has died, and his carcass is rotting. It is going to make all the poultry yard offensive.' They will take you and throw you out. And then see whither your way lies."" The fox did as the hedgehog had advised him, and when the people came and found him in that state, they hauled him out and threw him out of the yard onto the road. Quicker than you could clap your hands, the fox was on his legs, and he ran as if the ground was burning under him. Since then the fox and the hedgehog are good friends.",Romania,"Source: M.

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Fox and the Cat,"A fox was boasting to a cat of its clever devices for escaping its enemies. ""I have a whole bag of tricks,"" he said, ""which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies."" ""I have only one,"" said the cat. ""But I can generally manage with that."" Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them, and the cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs. ""This is my plan,"" said the cat. ""What are you going to do?"" The fox thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating, the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen. Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said, ""Better one safe way than a hundred on which you cannot reckon."" It happened that the cat met Mr. Fox in the woods. She thought, ""He is intelligent and well experienced, and is highly regarded in the world,"" so she spoke to him in a friendly manner, ""Good-day, my dear Mr. Fox. How is it going? How are you? How are you getting by in these hard times?"" The fox, filled with arrogance, examined the cat from head to feet, and for a long time did not know whether he should give an answer. At last he said, ""Oh, you poor beard-licker, you speckled fool, you hungry mouse hunter, what are you thinking? Have you the nerve to ask how I am doing? What do you know? How many tricks do you understand?"" ""I understand only one,"" answered the cat, modestly. ""What kind of a trick is it?"" asked the fox. ""When the dogs are chasing me, I can jump into a tree and save myself."" ""Is that all?"" said the fox. ""I am master of a hundred tricks, and in addition to that I have a sackful of cunning. I feel sorry for you. Come with me, and I will teach you how one escapes from the dogs."" Just then a hunter came by with four dogs. The cat jumped nimbly up a tree, and sat down at its top, where the branches and foliage completely hid her. ""Untie your sack, Mr. Fox, untie your sack,"" the cat shouted to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast. ""Oh, Mr. Fox,"" shouted the cat. ""You and your hundred tricks are left in the lurch.

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Fox and the Hedgehog,"A fox meeting a hedgehog asked him, ""How many wits have you?"" And he replied, ""Only three. But how many have you?"" ""I,"" boasted the fox,"" have seventy-seven."" As they were talking and walking along, not noticing where they were going, they fell into a deep hole which the peasants had dug. The fox asked the hedgehog to save him. The hedgehog said, ""I have only three wits. Perhaps you will save me first, then I will see about you afterwards,"" and he asked the fox to pitch him out of the hole. The fox did so, and then asked the hedgehog whether he could help him. The hedgehog said, ""I cannot help you with three, if you cannot help yourself with seventy-seven."" And so the fox was caught in the morning by the peasants and killed. The hedgehog answered, ""No, I am afraid of the traps that they have set out there."" The fox said, ""Have no fear. You'll come to no harm, because I have three bags full of tricks."" So they went there together and ate until they were full, but just as they were leaving, the fox caught herself in an iron trap. She called out, ""Help me, Hedgehog! I'm caught in a trap."" He said, ""Empty the tricks out of your bag, so I can free you."" The fox said, ""I jumped over a ditch, and all my tricks fell out. Don't you know even one?"" The hedgehog replied, ""I know two of them. The one is that when the farmer comes, just play dead; the other is that while you are playing dead you should let a mighty fart."" The fox did what the hedgehog had advised, and when the farmer came by, he thought that the fox was already stinky rotten and threw her out of the vineyard. Thus she escaped. Another time the fox again asked the hedgehog to go with her the vineyard and eat grapes. Because everything had worked out so well the first time, he went with her this time as well. After they had eaten until they were full and were about to leave, the hedgehog caught himself in a trap. He called out, ""Help me, Mistress Fox, I'm caught in a trap. Empty out your tricks and free me from the trap."" The fox replied, ""I jumped over a ditch again, and all my tricks fell out."" The hedgehog said, ""Since I am about to die, forgive me of my sins."" The fox said, ""If you will forgive me all of my sins against you, then I will ask God to forgive you of all your sins."" Then the hedgehog asked, ""Come closer and we'll hug one another, because we have lived together for such a long time."" The fox went to him, and they hugged one another. Then the hedgehog said, ""You should also kiss me on the mouth."" The fox did so, but the hedgehog grabbed hold of her tongue with his teeth and held her there until the farmer came by. When the farmer saw how the hedgehog had caught the fox he laughed, then he killed the fox and let the hedgehog run away.",South Slavonic Greece,"Source: M.

The Fox and the Cat,0105,The Seven-Witted Fox and the One-Witted Owl,"One day the owl met a fox, and the latter bragged about his intelligence and cleverness, and said that he was very cunning and slim. The owl asked him, ""Brother mine, how many minds (wits) have you?"" ""Seven,"" he said, boastingly. ""No wonder you are so clever. I have only one,"" said the owl. A short time afterwards the owl again met the fox, but this time he was running for his life. The hunters were after him, and the hounds were trying to catch him. Running as fast as his legs could carry him, he at last managed to slip into a hole. The owl followed him, and seeing him there, exhausted, asked him, ""How many minds (wits) have you?"" And he replied, ""Six. I have lost one by the chase."" Meanwhile the hunters and dogs came nearer and nearer, so they could hear the baying of the dogs. The fox did not know what to do. The owl asked him, ""How many minds (wits) have you now, old fellow?"" ""Oh, I have lost all my minds (wits). I have none left."" ""Where is your cunning of which you bragged?"" ""It is not kind of you, now, to go for a poor fellow when the dogs are at his heels, and there is no escape for him."" ""Well,"" said the owl, ""I have but one mind (wit), and I will see whether I cannot save you with my one wit. It is my turn. I am going to lie down here at the entrance as though dead. When the hunters come, they will see me and get hold of me and talk about me. Meanwhile they will forget you, and in the midst of the trouble, you just dash out and run for your life."" It happened just as the owl had said. No sooner did the hunters come up and find the owl than they said, ""What is this ugly bird doing here? And a dead one to boot."" And whilst they were busy with the owl, trying to get hold of it to throw it away, off went the fox through them and escaped. Soon afterwards the owl met him again, and she said, ""How have your seven minds (wits) helped you when in time of danger? It is like that with people who have too much. They often have nothing when they want it most, but you see, I had only one mind (wit), but a strong one and not a dissolute one like yours, and that saved both you and me.""",Romania,"Source: M.

The Fox Steals the Butter,0015,Cat and Mouse in Partnership,"A cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her, that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. ""But we must make preparations for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,"" said the cat, ""and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere, or in the end you will be caught in a trap."" This good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat, but they did not know where to store it. Finally, after much consideration, the cat said, ""I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church. No one dares take anything away from there. We will put it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are need it."" So the pot was stored safely away, but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, ""I wanted to tell you, little mouse, that my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and she has asked me to be his godfather. He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself."" ""Yes, yes,"" answered the mouse. ""By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me. I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself."" All this, however, was untrue. The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather. He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat. Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun, licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat. He did not return home until it was evening. ""Well, here you are again,"" said the mouse. ""You must have had a happy day."" ""Everything went well,"" answered the cat. ""What name did they give the child?"" asked the mouse. ""Top-Off,"" said the cat quite coolly. ""Top-Off?"" cried the mouse. ""That is a very odd and uncommon name. Is it a usual one in your family?"" ""What does that matter?"", said the cat. ""It is no worse than Crumb-Thief, as your godchildren are called."" Before long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. He said to the mouse, ""You must do me a favor, and once more manage the house alone for a day. I have been asked again to be godfather, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse."" The good mouse consented. However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. ""Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself,"" he said, and was quite satisfied with his day's work. When he arrived home the mouse asked, ""What name was this child christened with?"" ""Half-Gone,"" answered the cat. ""Half-Gone? What are you saying? I have never heard that name in all my life. I'll wager it is not in the almanac."" The cat's mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods. ""All good things come in threes,"" he said to the mouse. ""I have been asked to be godfather again. The child is totally black, only it has white paws. Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body. This only happens once every few years. You will let me go, won't you?"" ""Top-Off. Half-Gone,"" answered the mouse. ""They are such odd names, that they make me stop and think."" ""Here you sit at home,"" said the cat, ""with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies. That is because you do not go out in the daytime."" During the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat. ""One has peace only after everything is eaten up,"" he said to himself. Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime. The mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child. ""You will not like it either,"" said the cat. ""His name is All-Gone."" ""All-Gone!"", cried the mouse. ""That is the most worrisome name of all. I have never seen it in print. All-Gone! What can that mean?"" Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather, but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their stored food, and said, ""Come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves. It will taste good now."" ""Yes,"" answered the cat. ""You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."" They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat, to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty. ""Alas,"" said the mouse, ""now I see what has happened. Now it comes to light. You are a true friend. You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather. First top off, then half done, then ..."" ""Be quiet!"" cried the cat. ""One more word, and I will eat you too."" ""All gone"" was already on the poor mouse's lips. She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.

The Fox Steals the Butter,0015,Reynard and Bruin,"You must know that once upon a time Reynard the Fox and Bruin the Bear went into partnership and kept house together. Would you like to know the reason? Well, Reynard knew that Bruin had a beehive full of honeycomb, and that was what he wanted. But Bruin kept so close a guard upon his honey that Master Reynard didn't know how to get away from him and get hold of the honey. So one day he said to Bruin, ""Pardner, I have to go and be gossip -- that means godfather, you know -- to one of my old friends."" ""Why, certainly,"" said Bruin. So off Reynard goes into the woods, and after a time he crept back and uncovered the beehive and had such a feast of honey. Then he went back to Bruin, who asked him what name had been given to the child. Reynard had forgotten all about the christening and could only say, ""Just-Begun."" ""What a funny name,"" said Master Bruin. A little while after, Reynard thought he would like another feast of honey. So he told Bruin that he had to go to another christening. And off he went. And when he came back and Bruin asked him what was the name given to the child, Reynard said, ""Half-Eaten."" The third time the same thing occurred, and this time the name given by Reynard to the child that didn't exist was ""All-Gone."" You can guess why. A short time afterwards, Master Bruin thought he would like to eat up some of his honey and asked Reynard to come and join him in the feast. When they got to the beehive, Bruin was so surprised to find that there was no honey left, and he turned round to Reynard and said, ""Just-Begun, Half-Eaten, All-Gone. So that is what you meant. You have eaten my honey."" ""Why no,"" said Reynard. ""How could that be?"" I have never stirred from your side except when I went a-gossiping [serving as godfather], and then I was far away from here. You must have eaten the honey yourself, perhaps when you were asleep. At any rate we can easily tell. Let us lie down here in the sunshine, and if either of us has eaten the honey, the sun will soon sweat it out of us."" No sooner said than done, and the two lay side by side in the sunshine. Soon Master Bruin commenced to doze, and Mr. Reynard took some honey from the hive and smeared it round Bruin's snout. Then he woke him up and said, ""See, the honey is oozing out of your snout. You must have eaten it when you were asleep.""",Europe,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, Europa's Fairy Book (New York and London: G.

The Fox Steals the Butter,0015,The Fox and the Wolf,"The fox and the wolf stole a keg of butter from a peasant and hid it in a safe place. However, the hiding-place was far from where they lived, and one day when the fox got the urge to have a taste of the butter by himself, he felt the necessity of borrowing the wolf's boots for the long journey. The wolf, of course, asked him why he needed the boots. ""Well,"" said the fox, ""I must travel a great distance to a baptism."" ""Good,"" said the wolf, and the fox, wearing the wolf's boots, took off for the keg. When he returned, the wolf asked him what the child's name was. ""Beginning"" said the fox, and wolf thought to himself, ""That is a nice name."" A short time later the fox came again and asked to borrow the boots, saying that once again he had to go to a baptism. ""Good,"" said the wolf, and once again the fox set forth wearing the wolf's boots. When he returned, the wolf asked him, ""What is the child's name?"" ""Middle-of-the-Keg"" said the fox, and the wolf thought, ""That is an even nicer name."" Some time later the fox came again and said that still another child was to be baptized. When he brought back the boots, the wolf again asked him what name the child had been given. ""Well,"" said the fox, ""this time his name is Bottom-of-the-Keg."" When the fox came a fourth time, the wolf grew somewhat impatient and asked if there would be no end to the baptisms. ""Yes,"" said the fox. ""This is the last time."" ""If that is so,"" said the wolf, ""then go ahead and put on the boots."" The fox went again to the keg, and licked it clean. Then he filled it with stones, spread a thin layer of butter over them, and went home. The wolf again asked him what the child's name was, and the fox answered, ""Scrape-out-the-Keg."" Some time later the fox proposed to the wolf that the two of them should go to the keg of butter and have a real feast. Arriving there, they began quarreling with one another which one should have the first serving. Unable to decide, they drew straws. The wolf was lucky and drew the longer one, so he was to begin first. He started eating vigorously, but, of course, got only a mouthful of stones. You should have seen the wolf and the fox. Each one accused the other one of eating up the butter. ""You did it when you were going to the baptisms,"" said the wolf. ""No,"" said the fox. ""You did it when you knew that I wasn't at home."" But none of this led anywhere. The keg was empty and remained empty, so they decided to return home without further delay. On their way home they found an old horse in a mire. They wanted to take it with them and asked one another how they might manage. The fox said, ""You are the strongest. Tie the horse's tail around your body and pull, while I prod the horse with a stick."" That happened, and soon the horse was out of the mud, but it then ran off with the wolf tied to its tail. ""Claw your paws into the ground!"" cried the fox. ""But I can see neither heaven nor earth!"" answered the wolf. Finally the wolf succeeded in breaking loose, and he and the fox continued on their way, but without the horse. When they arrived at home the wolf sat down with his back to the fire, for he was wet to the bone. Sitting there, he fell asleep. The fox took some butter and spread it under the wolf's tail. Because of the warmth it soon melted. Then the fox woke up the wolf and shouted, ""Now it is clear who licked out the butter keg.""",Netherlands,"Source: G. J.

The Fox Steals the Butter,0015,The Fox Cheats the Bear out of His Christmas Fare,"A bear and a fox had once bought between them a tub of butter, which they intended to keep till Christmas, and, therefore, hid it under a thick pine bush. They then went a little distance and lay down on a sunny bank to sleep. When they had lain some time, the fox started up and cried out, ""Yes,"" and ran away towards the butter tub, out of which he ate a good third. When he returned the bear asked him where he had been, as he looked so greasy about the mouth. He said, ""What do you think of my being invited to a christening?"" ""Oh, indeed! What is the name of the child?"" asked the bear. ""Begun Upon,"" answered the fox. Thereupon they lay down to sleep again. In a little while the fox sprang up again and cried out, ""Yes,"" and ran to the butter tub. This time he also ate a good portion. When he came back, and the bear again asked where he had been, he answered, ""Oh, would you believe it? I have again been invited to a christening."" ""What is the name of the child?"" asked the bear. ""Half Eaten,"" answered the fox. The bear thought that was a strange name, though he did not wonder long about it, but gave a gape and went to sleep again. They had not lain long when the same took place as before. The fox sprang up and cried out, ""Yes,"" and ran to the butter tub, and this time he ate the remainder. When he came back, he had been once more to a christening, and when the bear inquired the name of the child, he answered, ""Licked to the Bottom!"" They now lay down and slept a long time. At length they agreed to go and look after their butter, and when they found it all eaten up, the bear accused the fox, and the fox accused the bear, of having eaten it. One said that the other must have been to the butter tub while he slept. ""Well, well!"" said Reynard. ""We shall soon see which of us two has stolen the butter. Let us both now lie down on this sunny bank, and the one whose tail is the greasiest when we wake, must be the one who has stolen it."" The bear was willing to undergo the ordeal. So, feeling conscious of his innocence, and that he had not even tasted the butter, he lay down to have a good sound sleep in the sun. But Reynard, instead of sleeping, crept softly to the butter tub, and got a little that still remained between the staves. Then sneaking gently back to the bear, he rubbed his tail with it, and lay down to sleep as if nothing had happened. When they both woke, the sun had melted the butter on the bear's tail, so that he was proved to be the one that had eaten the butter.",Norway,"Source: Benjamin Thorpe, Yule-Tide Stories: A Collection of Scandinavian and North German Popular Tales and Traditions (London: Henry G.

The Fox Steals the Butter,0015,The Keg of Butter,"The russet dog and the wild dog (the fox and the wolf) were going together. And they went round about the seashore, and they found a keg of butter, and they buried it. On the morrow the fox went out, and when he returned, he said that a man had come to ask him to a baptism. The fox went, and he arrayed himself in excellent attire, and he went away. And where should he go but to the butter keg. And when he came home, the wolf asked him, ""What name was given to the child?"" And he said that it was Foveeal (under its mouth). On the morrow the fox said that a man had sent to ask him to a baptism. And he went to the keg, and he took out about half. The wolf asked, when he came home, ""What name was given to the child?"" ""Well,"" said he, ""It is a queer name that I myself would not give to my man child, if I had one. It is Moolay Moolay (about half and half)."" On the morrow the fox said that a man had come to ask him to a baptism again. And he went to the keg, and he ate it all up. When he came home, the wolf asked him, ""What name was given to the child?"" And he said that it was Booill Eemlich (licking all up). On the morrow the fox said to the wolf that they ought to bring the keg home. They went, and when they reached the keg, there was not a shadow of the butter in it. ""Well,"" said the fox, ""you came here without me!"" The other one swore that he had not come near it. ""You need not be claiming that you did not come here. I know that you did come, and that it was you who took the butter. And when we go home, I will see if you ate the butter,"" said the fox. When they arrived home, the fox hung the wolf by his hind legs, with his head dangling below him. Then he put a dab of the butter under the wolf's mouth, as though it had come out of the wolf's belly. ""You red thief!"" said the fox.

"The Fox, the Wolf, and the Horse",0047e,The Wolf and the Tailor,"One day they were still on their road, going on a long, long road, and a wolf met them and said: ""Lord, I am feeling hungry."" ""Go,"" Christ said to him, ""and eat a mare."" So the wolf went to look for a mare. And he saw her going up and down, and said: ""Mare, the Lord has bidden me eat you!"" So she answered: ""Well, please do not eat me it is not the proper thing. But I have a passport on me; only it is driven in very hard."" ""Well, show it me."" ""Just come near my hind feet!"" So the wolf went up, and she kicked him with her hoofs, and knocked out his front teeth, so that the wolf was thrown, at a blow, three sazhéns away, and the mare ran off. [A sazhén is seven feet.] Back the wolf came with a petition, met Christ, and said: ""Lord, the mare almost killed me!"" ""Well, go on and eat the ram."" So the wolf ran up to the ram ran up and said: ""Ram, I am going to eat you; it is the command of the Lord."" ""Well, come and eat me up if you will. I will stand on the hill, and will jump up into your mouth all ready."" So the wolf stood on the hill, and the ram told him to open his mouth. So the wolf went and stood on the hill and opened his mouth for the food, and the ram ran down and hit him hard with the horns on his fore-head whack! The wolf was knocked off his feet, and the ram went away. And the wolf got up, looked all round, and there was never a sign of the ram. So he went up with another complaint. And he found Christ and said: ""Lord, even the ram has deceived me. Why, it almost knocked me to bits."" ""All right!"" said Christ. ""Go and eat the tailor."" So the wolf ran up, and he met a tailor on the way. ""Tailor,"" he said, ""I am going to eat you, by command of the Lord."" ""All right. Let me say good-bye I should like to greet my kin."" ""No, I cannot let you say good-bye with your kin."" ""Well, I cannot help it it must be so. Come and eat me up. Only at least let me take your measurements. I only want to see whether I shall slip in easily."" ""All right! Measure away,"" said the wolf. So the tailor went back, took hold of the wolf by his tail, twined his tail round in his hand, and began to whip the wolf. And the wolf struggled and tussled, roared and shrieked, and tore until he tore his tail loose, and he then took to his feet. So he ran away with all of his might, and he met seven other wolves. They said: ""Why are you, grey wolf, tailless?"" ""Oh, the tailor tore it out."" ""Where is the tailor?"" ""You see him there, on the road."" "" All right we will hunt after him."" And they started after the tailor. When the tailor heard the chase coming after him, and saw that it was a disagreeable business, he scaled up a tree as fast as he could. So the wolves arrived there and said: ""We will stop here, brothers, and wait until the tailor comes down. Do you, manx-wolf, stop below, and we will each of us climb on the other's shoulders."" So the manx-wolf lay at the bottom, and all the seven wolves went after the others and climbed up.

Haunted by the Ghost of a Murdered Child,4025,The Child Phantom,"Many years ago there died on the estate of Sundshult, in the parish of Nafverstad, a child of illegitimate birth, which, because of this, was not christened and could not be accorded Christian burial, or a place in heaven, and whose spirit, therefore, was left to wander the earth, disturbing the rest and making night uncomfortable for the people of the neighborhood. One time, just before Christmas, the parish shoemaker, on his rounds, was detained at the house of a patron, and, having much work before him, he was still sewing late into the night, when he was unexpectedly startled from his employment by a little child appearing before him, which said, ""Why do you sit there? Move aside."" ""For what?"" asked the shoemaker. ""Because I wish to dance,"" said the specter. ""Dance away, then!"" said the shoemaker. When the child had danced some time, it disappeared, but returned soon and said, ""I will dance again, and I'll dance your light out for you."" ""No,"" said the shoemaker, ""let the light alone. But who are you that you are here in this manner?"" ""I live under the lower stone of the steps to the porch."" ""Who put you there?"" asked the shoemaker. ""Watch when it dawns, and you will see my mother coming, wearing a red cap. But help me out of this, and I'll never dance again."" This the shoemaker promised to do, and the specter vanished. The next day a servant girl from the neighboring estate came, who wore upon her head a red handkerchief. Digging was begun under the designated step, and in time the skeleton of a child was found, encased in a wooden tub.

Godfather Death,0332,"Dr. Urssenbeck, Physician of Death","The following story is told as to how he achieved this remarkable gift: In his earlier years he followed the trade of a poor but honest weaver in the town of Deckendorf near Straudigen in Bavaria. It was a time of famine, and he, his wife, and their eleven children were in great need. Then a twelfth child was born, and they could find no one to serve as its godparent. As a last chance, the poor weaver walked to a nearby village and asked an old friend to serve as godfather, but met only rejection. Disappointed and frustrated the poor man made his back to his family. While walking sorrowfully through the dense forest toward his home, he said: ""If I only could die."" Suddenly a tall figure dressed in a dark cloak appeared before him, saying: ""You called me. I am Death. What can I do for you?"" As much as the man had previously wanted to die, he now wanted to live. ""I am seeking a godfather for my youngest child. But I cannot find anyone who will serve as his godparent,"" answered the weaver sadly. ""I will accept this responsibility,"" said Death. And thus it happened. Following the baptism the mysterious godfather took the father aside and said: ""Since I possess neither gold nor silver to give to your child as a baptism present, I will make you into the most famous doctor of all times. Whenever you are called to a sick person, I -- invisible to others -- will seat myself either to the head or to the feet of the patient. If I am seated at the head, then this will show you that hope for recovery exists. If I am seated at the feet, then the patient will die. Through this gift the weaver was able to cure many illnesses, for he knew whether the patient who had sought his treatment would be helped by medications, or whether he would die. Soon the previously poor weaver became a wealthy and respected physician. However, his increased wealth made him ever-more greedy One day a very wealthy man fell seriously ill, but when Dr. Urssenbeck was called in, and he saw that Death was already seated at the patient's feet. Upon hearing the diagnosis, the next of kin could not be comforted, and they offered the physician a fortune if he could heal the prince. Then Urssenbeck resorted to trickery. He quickly had the patient's bed turned around, so that Death was now seated at his head. Thus the man was rescued from Death, and he regained his health. On the physician's way home Death suddenly appeared before him. ""You unfortunate one, why have you deceived me? In return for the life that you have given back to the rich man, you yourself must now die"" spoke the reaper with a threatening voice, and disappeared. Dr. Urssenbeck suddenly found himself in a large room where thousands of candles were burning. Death said to him, ""Each of these candles represents someone's life. This tiny stump that is about to go out is yours."" Terrified, Dr. Urssenbeck reached for a taller candle, wanting to take some wax from it to replenish his stump, but in so doing he touched his own candle, and it went out, and he fell to the floor dead. That evening his body was found in a ravine. He was buried in the graveyard of Saint Stephen's Cathedral.",Austria,"Source: Abstracted from J. W. Holczabek and A.

Godfather Death,0332,Godfather Death,"Once upon a time there was an old man who already had twelve children, and when the thirteenth was born he did not know where to turn for help. In desperation he went into the woods. There the Good Lord happened upon him and said to him, ""I feel sorry for you, poor man. I will lift your child from his baptism and take care of him. He will be happy on earth."" The man answered, ""I do not want you as a godfather. You give to the rich and let the poor starve."" With that he left him standing there and continued on his way. Soon thereafter Death happened upon him and also said to him, ""I will be godfather for you and pick up your child. And if he has me as a friend, he will lack nothing. I will make a doctor of him."" The man said, ""I am satisfied with that, for without distinction you take the rich as well as the poor. Tomorrow is Sunday, when the child will be baptized. Be on time."" The next day Death arrived and held the child for his baptism. After he had grown up, Death came again and took his godchild into the woods, and said to him, ""Now you are to become a doctor. You must only pay attention when you are called to a sick person and see if I am standing at his head. If so, without further ado let him smell from this flask, then anoint his feet with its contents, and he soon will regain his health. But if I am standing at his feet, then he is finished, for I will soon take him. Do not attempt to begin a cure."" With that Death gave him the flask, and he became a renowned doctor. He only needed to see a patient, and he could immediately predict whether he would regain his health or die. Once he was summoned to the king, who was suffering from a serious illness. When the doctor approached him, he saw Death standing at the king's feet, and his flask would be of no use. But it occurred to him that he might deceive Death. Thus he took hold of the king and turned him around, so that Death was now standing at his head. It succeeded, and the king regained his health. After the doctor returned home, Death came to him, made angry and grim faces at him, and said, ""If you ever again attempt to deceive me, I shall wring your neck."" Soon afterward the king's beautiful daughter took ill. No one on earth could help her. The king wept day and night, until finally he proclaimed that whoever could cure her could have her as a reward. The doctor came and saw Death standing at her feet. Astonished at her beauty, he forgot the warning, turned her around, let her smell from the healing flask, and anointed the soles of her feet with its contents. He had scarcely returned home when Death with his terrifying face appeared before him, seized him, and carried him to an underground cavern where many thousand lights were burning. ""Look!"" said Death. ""These are all the living. And here is a light that will burn only a little longer, and then go out. This is your life!

Godfather Death,0332,The Boy with the Ale Keg,"Once upon a time there was a boy who had served a man in the northern mountains for a long time. This man was a master at ale brewing. It was so uncommonly good, the like of it was not to be found. So, when the boy was to leave his place and the man was to pay him the wages he had earned, he would take no other pay than a keg of Yule-ale. Well, he got it and set off with it, and he carried it both far and long, but the longer he carried the keg the heavier it got, and so he began to look about to see if anyone were coming with whom he might have drink, that the ale might lessen and the keg lighten. And after a long, long time, he met an old man with a big beard. ""Good day,"" said the man. ""Good day to you,"" said the boy. ""Where are you going?"" asked the man. ""I'm looking for someone to drink with me, and lighten my keg,"" said the boy. ""Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?"" said the man. ""I have traveled both far and wide, and I am both tired and thirsty."" ""Well, why shouldn't I?"" said the boy. ""But tell me, where are you from, and what sort of man are you?"" ""I am the Lord, and come from Heaven,"" said the man. ""I will not drink with you,"" said the boy, ""for you make such distinction between persons here on earth, and you divide rights so unevenly that some get so rich and some so poor. No, I will not drink with you!"" And having said this he trudged off again with his keg. When he had gone a bit farther the keg grew too heavy again. He thought he could not carry it any longer unless someone came with whom he might drink, and so lessen the ale in the keg. Yes, he met an ugly, scrawny man who came rushing along. ""Good day,"" said the man. ""Good day to you,"" said the boy. ""Where are you going?"" asked the man. ""Oh, I'm looking for someone to drink with, and lighten my keg,"" said the boy. ""Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?"" said the man. ""I have traveled both far and wide, and I am tired and thirsty."" ""Well, why not?"" said the boy. ""But who are you, and where do you come from?"" ""Who am I? I am the Devil, and I come from Hell, that's where I come from,"" said the man. ""No!"" said the boy. ""You only torment and plague poor folk, and if there is any unhappiness astir, they always say it is your fault. I will not drink with you."" So he went far and farther than far again with his ale keg on his back, until he thought it grew so heavy there was no carrying it any farther. He began to look around again if anyone were coming with whom he could drink and lighten his keg. So after a long, long time, another man came, and he was so dried up and scrawny it was a wonder that his bones hung together. ""Good day,"" said the man. ""Good day to you,"" said the boy. ""Where are you going?"" asked the man. ""Oh, I was only looking about to see if I could find someone to drink with, that my keg might be lightened a little, it is so heavy to carry."" ""Can't you drink with me as well as with anyone else?"" said the man. ""Yes, why not?"" said the boy. ""But what sort of man are you?"" ""They call me Death,"" said the man. ""I will gladly drink with you.,"" said the boy. And as he said this he put down his keg and began to tap the ale into a bowl. ""You are a good man, for you treat all alike, both rich and poor."" So he drank to his health, and Death drank to his health, and Death said he had never tasted such drink, and as the boy was fond of him, they drank bowl after bowl until the ale was lessened, and the keg grew light. At last Death said, ""I have never known drink which tasted better, or did me so much good as this ale that you have given me, and I scarce know what to give you in return."" But after he had thought awhile, he said the keg should never get empty, however much they drank out of it, and the ale that was in it should become a healing drink, by which the boy could make the sick whole again better than any doctor. And he also said that when the boy came into a sick man's room, Death would always be there, and show himself to him, and it should be to him a sure sign if he saw Death at the foot of the bed that he could cure the sick with a draft from the keg; but if he sat by the pillow, there was no healing nor medicine, for then the sick person belonged to Death. Well, the boy soon grew famous, and was summoned far and near, and he helped many to health again who had been given up. When he came in and saw how Death sat by a sick man's bed, he foretold either life or death, and his foretelling was never wrong. He became both a rich and powerful man, and at last he was summoned to a king's daughter far, far away in the world. She was so dangerously ill that no doctor thought he could do her any good, and so they promised him all that he might ask for if he would only save her life. Now, when he came into the princess's room, there sat Death at her pillow; but as he sat he dozed and nodded, and while he did this she felt better. ""Now, life or death is at stake,"" said the doctor; ""and I fear, from what I see, there is no hope."" But they said he must save her, if it cost land and realm. So he looked at Death, and while he sat there and dozed again, he made a sign to the servants to turn the bed around so quickly that Death was left sitting at the foot, and at the very moment they turned the bed, the doctor gave her the draft, and her life was spared. ""Now you have cheated me,"" said Death, ""and we are quits."" ""I was forced to do it,"" said the doctor, ""unless I wished to lose land and realm."" ""That shall not help you much,"" said Death. ""Your time is up, for now you belong to me."" ""Well,"" said the boy, ""what must be must be. But you'll let me have time to read the Lord's Prayer first?"" Yes, he might have leave to do that. But he took very good care not to read the Lord's Prayer. He read everything else, but the Lord's Prayer never crossed his lips, and at last he thought he had cheated Death for good and all. But when Death thought he had really waited too long, he went to the boy's house one night, and hung up a large tablet with the Lord's Prayer painted on it over against his bed. So when the boy woke in the morning he began to read the tablet, and did not quite see what he was doing until he came to Amen. But then it was just too late, and Death had him.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Gutten med øldunken, Norske Folkeeventyr.","I have used the edition Popular Tales from the Norse, translated by George Webbe Dasent (Edinburgh: David Douglass, 1888).

Godfather Death,0332,The Just Man,"Once upon a time there was a peasant and his wife who had a child that they would not baptize until they could find a just man for his godfather. The father took the child in his arms and went into the street to look for this just man. After he had walked along a while, he met a man, who was our Lord, and said to him, ""I have this child to baptize, but I do not want to give him to anyone who is not just. Are you just?"" The Lord answered, ""But -- I don't know whether I am just."" Then the peasant passed on and met a woman, who was the Madonna, and said to her, ""I have this child to baptize and do not wish to give him to anyone who is not just. Are you just?"" ""I don't know,"" said the Madonna. ""But go on, for you will find someone who is just."" He went his way and met another woman, who was Death, and said to her, ""I have been sent to you, for I have been told that you are just, and I have this child to baptize, and do not wish to give it to one who is not just. Are you just?"" Death said, ""Yes, I believe I am just! Let us baptize the child, and then I will show you whether I am just."" Then they baptized the child, and afterwards Death led the peasant into a very long room, where there were many lights burning. ""Godmother,"" said the man, astonished at seeing all the light, ""what are all these lights?"" Death said, ""These are the lights of all the souls in the world. Would you like to see, friend? This is yours and this is your son's"" When the peasant saw that his light was about to expire, he said, ""And when the oil is all consumed, godmother?"" ""Then,"" answered Death, ""you must come with me, for I am Death."" ""Oh! for mercy's sake,"" cried the peasant, ""let me at least take a little oil from my son's lamp and put it in mine!"" ""No, no, godfather,"" said Death. ""I don't do anything of that sort. You wished to see a just person, and a just person you have found.

Bardus was terrified, but still the voice implored help, and at length Adrian was drawn up. At once this lord departed without thanks, and threatened Bardus with vengeance if ever he should claim the promise. The poor man went home, not daring to speak more, and on the next day, going to get wood, he found that the ape had requited his kindness by gathering for him a great heap of sticks, and so continued to do day by day; and the serpent brought him a precious stone in her mouth. This last he sold to a jeweler and afterwards found it again in his purse, and as often as he sold it, the same thing followed. At length this came to be known, and the Emperor heard of it.

The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,0160,Of Ingratitude,"It happened that the seneschal himself went into this forest, and with much exaltation of heart exclaimed internally, ""Lives there a being in the empire more powerful than I am?"" This braggart thought was scarcely formed, ere he rode upon one of his own pitfalls, and immediately disappeared. The same day had been taken a lion, a monkey, and a serpent. Terrified at the situation into which fate had thrown him, he cried out lustily, and his noise awoke a poor man called Guido, who had come with his ass into that forest to procure firewood, by the sale of which he got his bread. Hastening to the mouth of the pit, he was promised great wealth if he would extricate the seneschal from his perilous situation. ""My friend,"" answered Guido, ""I have no means of obtaining a livelihood except by the faggots which I collect. If I neglect this for a single day, I shall be thrown into the greatest difficulties."" The seneschal reiterated his promises of enriching him; and Guido went hack to the city, and returned with a long cord, which he let down into the pit, and bade the seneschal bind it round his waist. But before he could apply it to the intended purpose, the lion leaped forward, and seizing upon the cord, was drawn up in his stead. Immediately, exhibiting great signs of pleasure, the beast ran off into the wood. The rope again descended, and the monkey, having noticed the success of the lion, vaulted above the man's head, and shaking the cord, was in like manner set at liberty, and hurried off to his haunts. A third time the cord was let down, and the serpent, twining around it, was drawn up, gave signs of gratitude, and escaped. ""Oh, my good friend,"" said the seneschal, ""the beasts are gone, now draw me up quickly, I pray you."" Guido complied, and afterwards succeeded in drawing up his horse, which the seneschal instantly mounted and rode back to the palace. Guido returned home; and his wife observing that he had come without wood, was very dejected, and inquired the cause. He related what had occurred, and the riches he was to receive for his service. The wife's countenance brightened. Early in the morning her husband went to the palace. But the seneschal denied all knowledge of him, and ordered him to be whipped for his presumption. The porter executed the directions, and beat him so severely that he left him half dead. As soon as Guido's wife understood this, she saddled their ass, and brought him home in a very infirm state. The sickness which ensued consumed the whole of their little property; but as soon as he had recovered, he returned to his usual occupation in the wood. Whilst he was thus employed, he beheld afar off ten asses laden with packs, and a lion following close on them, pursuing the path which led towards Guido. On looking narrowly at this beast, he remembered that it was the same which he had freed from its imprisonment in the pit. The lion signified with his foot that he should take the loaded asses, and go home. This Guido did, and the lion followed. On arriving at his own door, the noble beast fawned upon him, and wagging his tail as if in triumph, ran back to the woods. Guido caused proclamation to be made in different churches, that if any asses had been lost, the owners should come to him; but no one appearing to demand them, he opened the packages, and, to his great joy, discovered them full of money. On the second day Guido returned to the forest, but forgot an iron instrument to cleave the wood. He looked up, and beheld the monkey whose liberation he had effected; and the animal, by help of teeth and nails, accomplished his desires. Guido then loaded his asses and went home. The next day he renewed his visit to the forest; and sitting down to prepare his instrument, discerned the serpent, whose escape he had aided, carrying a stone in its mouth of three colors; on one side white, on another black, and on the third red. It opened its mouth and let the stone fall into Guido's lap. Having done this, it departed. Guido took the stone to a skillful lapidary, who had no sooner inspected it than he knew its virtues, and would willingly have paid him an hundred florins for it. But Guido refused; and by means of that singular stone obtained great wealth, and was promoted to a military command. The emperor having heard of the extraordinary qualities which it possessed, desired to see it. Guido went accordingly; and the emperor was so struck with its uncommon beauty, that he wished to purchase it at any rate; and threatened, if Guido refused compliance, to banish him the kingdom. ""My lord,"" answered he, ""I will sell the stone; but let me say one thing -- if the price be not given, it shall be presently restored to me."" He demanded three hundred florin, and then, taking it from a small coffer, put it into the emperor's hands. Full of admiration, he exclaimed, ""Tell me where you procured this beautiful stone."" This he did; and narrated from the beginning the seneschal's accident and subsequent ingratitude. He told how severely he had been injured by his command; and the benefits he had received from the lion, the monkey, and serpent. Much moved at the recital, the emperor sent for the seneschal and said, ""What is this I hear of thee?"" He was unable to reply. ""O wretch!"" continued the emperor -- ""monster of ingratitude! Guido liberated thee from the most imminent danger, and for this thou hast nearly destroyed him. Dost thou see how even irrational things have rendered him good for the service he performed? but thou hast returned evil for good. Therefore I deprive thee of thy dignity, which I will bestow upon Guido; and I further adjudge you to be suspended on a cross."" This decree infinitely rejoiced the noblemen of the empire; and Guido, full of honors and years, ended his days in peace. Application: My beloved, the emperor is God; the pauper, man. The forest is the world, which is full of pits. The lion is the Son of God, who assumed humanity; the monkey is conscience; and the serpent is a prelate or confessor. The cord is Christ's passion; the loaded asses are the divine precepts.",Gesta Romanorum,"Source: Gesta Romanorum, translated from the Latin by Charles Swan (London: George Bell and Sons, 1906), no. 119, pp. 212-16.","The Gesta Romanorum (Deeds of the Romans) was compiled in Latin about 1300 AD.

The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,0160,Story of the Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Woman,"One day, as he was roaming about in the wood to assist others, he saw a great well and looked into it. And a woman, who was in it, said to him in a loud voice: ""Noble sir, here are four of us, myself a woman, a lion, and a golden-crested bird, and a snake, fallen into this well in the night; so take us out; have mercy upon us."" When he heard this, he said: ""Granted that you three fell in because the darkness made it impossible for you to see your way, but how did the bird fall in?"" The woman answered him: ""It fell in by being caught in a fowler's net."" Then the ascetic tried to lift them out by the supernatural power of his asceticism, but he could not; on the contrary, his power was gone. He reflected: ""Surely this woman is a sinner, and owing to my having conversed with her, my power is gone from me. So I will use other means in this case."" Then he plaited a rope of grass, and so drew them all four up out of the well, and they praised him. And in his astonishment he said to the lion, the bird and the snake: ""Tell me, how come you to have articulate voice, and what is your history?"" Then the lion said: "" We have articulate speech and remember our former births, and we are mutual enemies; hear our stories in turns."" So the lion began to tell his own story as follows: Then his father cursed him, saying: ""Fall into the world of mortals."" Then his arrogance was extinguished, and his knowledge left him, and smitten with the curse he wept, and asked his father to name a time when it should end. Then his father Padmavesa thought a little, and said immediately: ""You shall become a Brahmin's son on the earth, and display this arrogance once more, and by your father's curse you shall become a lion and fall into a well. And a man of noble character, out of compassion, shall draw you out, and when you have recompensed him in his calamity, you shall be delivered from this curse."" This was the termination of the curse which his father appointed for him. Then Vajravega was born in Malava as Devaghosha, the son of Harighosha, a Brahmin. And in that birth also he fought with many, confiding in his heroism, and his father said to him: ""Do not go on in this way quarrelling with everybody."" But he would not obey his father's orders, so his father cursed him: ""Become immediately a foolish lion, over-confident in its strength."" In consequence of this speech of his father's, Devaghosha, that incarnation of a Vidyadhara, was again born as a lion in this forest. After the lion had said this, he went away, and the golden-crested bird, being questioned by that Bodhisattva, told his tale. In his childishness he kept begging for the pinjara, saying: ""Give it me, I too want to play on it."" And when she would not give it him, in his flightiness he seized the pinjara, and flew up to heaven with it in the form of a bird. Then his sister cursed him, saying: ""Since you have taken my pinjara from me by force, and flown away with it, you shall become a bird with a golden crest."" When Rajatadamshtra heard this, he fell at his sister's feet, and entreated her to fix a time for his curse to end, and she said: ""When, foolish boy, you fall, in your bird-form, into a blind well, and a certain merciful person draws you out, and you do him a service in return, then you shall be released from this curse."" When she had said this to her brother, he was born as a bird with a golden crest. When the bird had said this, he departed. Then the snake, being questioned by that Bodhisattva, told his story to that great-souled one. Formerly I was the son of a hermit in the hermitage of Kasyapa. And I had a companion there who was also the son of a hermit. And one day my friend went down into the lake to bathe, and I remained on the bank. And while I was there, I saw a serpent come with three heads. And, in order to terrify that friend of mine in fun, I fixed the serpent immovable on the bank, opposite to where he was, by the power of a spell. My friend got through his bathing in a moment, and came to the bank, and unexpectedly seeing that great serpent there, he was terrified and fainted. After some time I brought my friend round again, but he, finding out by meditation that I had terrified him in this way, became angry, and cursed me, saying: ""Go and become a similar great snake with three crests."" Then I entreated him to fix an end to my curse, and he said: ""When, in your serpent condition, you fall into a well, and at a critical moment do a service to the man who pulls you out, then you shall be freed from your curse."" When the snake had said this, he departed, and the woman told her story. When the sinful woman had said this to the Bodhisattva, she went to the town of a king named Gotravardhana. She obtained an interview with him, and remained among his attendants, in the capacity of maid to the king's principal queen. But because that Bodhisattva talked with that woman, he lost his power, and could not procure fruits and roots and things of that kind. Then, being exhausted with hunger and thirst, he first thought of the lion. And, when he thought of him, he came and fed him with the flesh of deer, and in a short time he restored him to his former health with their flesh; and then the lion said: ""My curse is at an end, I will depart."" When he had said this, the Bodhisattva gave him leave to depart, and the lion became a Vidyadhara and went to his own place. Then that incarnation of a portion of a Bodhisattva, being again exhausted by want of food, thought upon that golden-crested bird, and he came, when thought of by him. And when he told the bird of his sufferings, the bird went and brought a casket full of jewels and gave it him, and said: ''This wealth will support you for ever, and so my curse has come to an end, now I depart; may you enjoy happiness!"" When he had said this, he became a young Vidyadhara prince, and went through the air to his own world, and received the kingdom from his father. And the Bodhisattva, as he was wandering about to sell the jewels, reached that city where the woman was living whom he had rescued from the well. And he deposited those jewels in an out-of-the-way house belonging to an old Brahmin woman, and went to the market, and on the way he saw coming towards him the very woman whom he had saved from the well, and the woman saw him. And the two fell into a conversation, and in the course of it the woman told him of her position about the person of the queen. And she asked him about his own adventures. So the confiding man told her how the golden-crested bird had given him the jewels. And he took her and showed her the jewels in the house of the old woman, and the wicked woman went and told her mistress, the queen, of it. Now it happened that the golden-crested bird had managed artfully to steal this casket of jewels from the interior of the queen's palace, before her eyes. And when the queen heard from the mouth of that woman, who knew the facts, that the casket had arrived in the city, she informed the king. And the king had the Bodhisattva pointed out by that wicked woman, and brought by his servants as a prisoner from that house with the ornaments. And after he had asked him the circumstances, though he believed his account, he not only took the ornaments from him, but he put him in prison. Then the Bodhisattva, terrified at being put in prison, thought upon the snake, who was an incarnation of the hermit's son, and the snake came to him. And when the snake had seen him, and inquired what his need was, he said to the good man: ""I will go and coil round the king from his head to his feet. And I will not let him go until I am told to do so by you. And you must say here, in the prison: 'I will deliver the king from the serpent.' And when you come and give me the order, I will let the king go. And when I let him go, he will give you half his kingdom."" After he had said this, the snake went and coiled round the king, and placed his three hoods on his head. And the people began to cry out: ""Alas I the king is bitten by a snake."" Then the Bodhisattva said: ""I will deliver the king from this snake."" And the king's servants, having heard this, informed him. Thereupon the king, who was in the grasp of the snake, had the Bodhisattva summoned, and said to him: ""If you deliver me from this snake, I will give you half my kingdom, and these my ministers are your guarantees that I will keep my promise."" When his ministers heard this, they said, ""Certainly,"" and then the Bodhisattva said to that snake: ""Let the king go at once."" Then the snake let the king go, and the king gave half his kingdom to that Bodhisattva, and thus he became prosperous in a moment. And the serpent, as its curse was at an end, became a young hermit, and he told his story in the presence of the court and went back to his hermitage.",The Kathasaritsagara,"Source: Ocean of Story: Being C.

The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,0160,The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,"His wife, overcome by poverty, every day would say: ""Oh, you cowardly, heard-hearted Brahmin. Do you not see how your children are tormented by hunger, while you stand by without caring! Set forth from here and with all your strength seek a way to get some food, then come back as soon as possible."" Exhausted from her complaints, he set forth on a lengthy journey. After a few days he found himself in a great forest. Tormented by hunger he began to look for water when he saw a deep pit covered over with leaves. At the bottom of the pit he saw a tiger, a monkey, snake, and a man; and they saw him as well. Perceiving that he was a man, the tiger said, ""Oh, you honorable one, remember that it is a great virtue to rescue a living being, and pull me out, so that I can return to the circle of my dear friends, my wife, and my family!"" The Brahmin said, ""The mere mention of your name brings fear to all living creatures. Should not I too be afraid of you?"" The tiger replied, ""Repentance is possible for the murderer of a Brahmin, for drunkards, hooligans, thieves, and promise-breakers, but not for those who are ungrateful. I swear with a three-fold oath that you have no cause to fear me. Therefore have mercy on me and pull me out!"" The Brahmin thought to himself, ""Death would bring salvation, if suffered while saving the life of another living being,"" and he helped the tiger out of the pit. Then the monkey said to him, ""My good man, help me out too!"" Hearing this, the Brahmin pulled him out. The snake said, ""Oh, consecrated one, pull me out too."" The Brahmin replied, ""Just saying your name causes one to tremble, much less touching you!"" The snake said, ""We do not act arbitrarily. We only bite if we are provoked into doing so. I swear with a three-fold oath that you have no cause to fear me."" After hearing this the Brahmin pulled the snake out. Then they all said to him, ""The man down there embraces every kind of sin. Take note of this, and do not help him out. Do not trust him."" Then the tiger spoke up again, ""My den is in a crack in the cliff on the north side of the many-peaked mountain that you can see. You must come to me there so I can repay you and not be in your debt in a future life."" Having said this he departed for his home. Then the monkey said, ""I live next to a waterfall in the vicinity of the tiger's den. You must visit me there!"" And with that he went on his way. The snake said, ""If your life is ever threatened, just think of me!"" And he went on his way. Then the man in the pit cried out repeatedly, ""Oh, Brahmin, help me out!"" Overcome by pity, the Brahmin finally pulled him out too. ""I am a goldsmith,"" said the rescued man, ""and if you ever need any gold-work done, just bring it to me."" Then he too went on his way. The Brahmin wandered about without finding anything to eat. Tormented by hunger he turned towards home, but then remembered what the monkey had said and went to him instead. The monkey gave him fruits as sweet as ambrosia, saying, ""Whenever you have need of fruit, just come back to me."" Then the consecrated one said, ""You have done well. Now show me the way to the tiger."" The monkey led him to the tiger's den. Recognizing him, the tiger gave the Brahmin a gold necklace along with other ornaments in payment for his good deed. The tiger explained: ""A certain prince, whose horse ran away with him, came under my claws, and I killed him. These things came from him, and I brought them here for you. Take them and go in peace!"" The Brahmin remembered the goldsmith and thought, ""He will know who I am, and will help me sell this gold."" The goldsmith received him with every courtesy: foot-washing, refreshment, and so forth, then said, ""Just let me know what I can do for you."" The consecrated one said, ""I have brought gold that you should sell for me."" The goldsmith said, ""Show me the gold!"" The Brahmin showed him the pieces, and the goldsmith recognized them as work that he himself had done for the king's son. ""Just wait here,"" he said, ""while I show the gold to someone."" Then he went to the palace and showed the gold to the king. ""Where did you get this?"" asked the king. ""There is a Brahmin in my house who brought it to me."" The king thought, ""He is the villain who killed my son. He shall pay for that!"" The king had his watchmen bind the Brahmin, with the order that he was to be impaled at the break of day. As he was being bound, the Brahmin remembered the snake, and in that same instant the snake appeared before him, and said, ""How can I serve you?"" The consecrated one said, ""Set me free."" The snake replied, ""I shall bite the king's favorite wife. Neither the incantations of the greatest sorcerers nor the medications of the best physicians shall free her from the poison. It will only go away when you touch her with your hand. And then you shall be set free."" After saying this, the snake bit the queen. A cry of despair arose at the palace, and the entire city was in shock. Sorcerer, healers, magicians, and physicians all tried to cure her, but their efforts had no effect on the poison. Answering the call of the public drummer, the consecrated one said, ""I can free her from the poison."" Thus the Brahmin was taken from prison and led to the king, who said, ""Free her from the poison!"" The Brahmin went to the queen, and with a mere touch of his hand he freed her from the poison. Seeing his wife alive and well once again, he approached the Brahmin with honor and respect. ""Where did you get the gold?"" he asked. The consecrated one related to him everything that had happened, from the very beginning. Now knowing the truth of the matter, the king had the goldsmith thrown into prison and he appointed the Brahmin as his minister and gave him a thousand villages. The Brahmin summoned his family and lived happily with his friends, taking pleasure in good works and enjoying the fruits of a virtuous preexistence. But the lion said, ""O honored ones, ye are all comrades of mine. As things are so, and we are suffering intolerable pain from woe, it is now no time for us to expose one another to danger. Therefore sit quietly without disturbing yourselves."" By the dispensation of destiny a hunter, who was looking for gazelles, came to that spot, and while he was looking at that pit, all those creatures exclaimed in confused words, ""Ho, friend, rescue us!"" Understanding what they said, the hunter drew out first of all the lion. It touched his feet and said, ""I shall prove grateful to you. But do not draw out that black-headed one who forgets accepted benefits."" Having thus spoken, the lion departed. The hunter then proceeded to extricate them all by degrees from the pit. One day the hunter came again to that spot when the lion had killed a gazelle. The lion recognized the man, and touched his feet, and gave him the gazelle. At another time King Brahmadatta had gone into the park with his spouse, and, after enjoying himself there, had lain down to sleep. Left at their ease, the women took off their clothes and exposed them to the air. And they laid aside their ornaments in divers places and roamed about, or sat, reposed, and slept in the grove. When one of the wives had laid aside her ornaments at a certain spot, and had gone to sleep, the falcon carried them off, and gratefully presented them to the hunter. When the king awoke from his sleep he went swiftly to Varanasi And away went quickly also the wives, princes, ministers, townspeople, and country-folk. The wife, who looked for her ornaments but could not find them, said to the king, ""O king, my ornaments are lost in the park."" The king gave orders to his ministers, saying, ""O honored ones, as the ornaments are lost, find out who has carried them off."" When they began to make inquiries, the black-headed man, who had visited the hunter from time to time and knew that he was in possession of the ornaments, came with ungrateful heart and told the king. Then the king was very angry. And the king's men summoned the hunter, and said to him, ""Ho, friend, you stole the ornaments out of the park."" The hunter was terrified and related what had taken place. The ornaments were restored to the king. But the hunter was bound and cast into prison. Then the mouse went to the snake and said, ""By the contrivance of the black-headed sinner has our benefactor been bound and cast into prison."" The snake said, ""O hunter, I will bite the king today. Then do you heal him with this spell and this remedy. If that is done, no doubt the king will set you at liberty, and will confer upon you gifts and good things."" The hunter said, ""Good, so be it!"" The snake bit the king, and the hunter came and healed him with the spell and the remedy. Then the king joyfully released him from the prison, and bestowed upon him gifts and good things.","India, The Panchatantra Tibet","Source: Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen, translated from the Sanskrit by Theodor Benfey; vol. 2 (Leipzig: F.

The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,0160,The Traveler and the Goldsmith,"So he took a rope, and let it down into the pit; and the monkey, owing to his dexterity and nimbleness, was the first to cling to it, and climb up; he then let it down a second time, and the serpent twisted himself round it, and came out; then a third time, and the tiger took hold of it, and he drew him up. Then the three beasts thanked him for his having assisted them to escape, but begged him not to release the goldsmith, adding, that men in general, and especially the person in question, were incapable of gratitude. And the monkey said to him, ""I live on a mountain near a city called Nawadarkht."" The tiger said, ""I live in a wood close by this city."" And the serpent, ""I dwell in the walls of the city, and if you pass in our neighborhood at any time, and have occasion for our services, call to us, and we will come and reward you for the kindness which you have shown us."" But the traveler paid no attention to what they had told him of the ingratitude of the man, but let down the rope again, and brought out the goldsmith, who thanked him for what he had done, and said, ""If ever you come to Nawadarkht, enquire for my house; I am a goldsmith, and shall be happy to be of any use to you I can for the service you have rendered me."" Then the goldsmith returned to the city, and the traveler continued his journey. Some time after the traveler had occasion to go to Nawadarkht, and as he was walking along, the monkey met him, and saluted him, and kissed his feet, and made apologies for the inability of monkeys to do much for a friend, but begged him to sit down, and wait till he returned; then the monkey went away, and very soon came back, bringing some choice fruit, which he placed before the traveler, who having eaten as much as he chose, continued his journey. And as he approached the gate of the city, the tiger advanced towards him, and placing himself in an humble posture before him, said, ""Wait a moment, and I will very soon come back to you."" Then the tiger went away, and entered the city by one of the walls, and killed the king's daughter, and tore off her trinkets, and brought them to the traveler, without informing him by what means he had procured them. Then the traveler said to himself, ""These beasts have rewarded me very handsomely, and I am now curious to see what the goldsmith will do. If he is poor, and has no means of showing his gratitude, he may at least sell these trinkets for their full value, with which of course he is acquainted, and divide with me the sum of money which he obtains for them."" So he went to the goldsmith, who, as soon as he saw him, saluted him, and made him enter his house; and observing the trinkets, he immediately recognized them to be those which he had made for the daughter of the king. He then told the traveler that he had no provisions in the house good enough for him, but if he would wait a little while, he would fetch him something to eat. Then he went out, and said to himself, ""This is an opportunity not to be lost; I will go to the king, and inform him of the discovery I have made, and he will no doubt acknowledge and reward my zeal."" Then he went to the antechamber of the king, and announced himself by a message to the following purport: ""The person who has killed your majesty's daughter and stolen her trinkets is at this moment in my house."" Then the king desired the traveler, to be brought before him, and as soon as he saw the jewels in his possession, he immediately ordered him to be put to the torture, and after that to be led through the city, and in the end put to death. Whilst the punishment was being executed, the traveler began to weep, and cry out with a loud voice, ""If I had attended to the hints which the monkey, the serpent, and the tiger gave me of the ingratitude of this man, I should have escaped this misfortune."" And as he repeated the same words several times, the serpent heard what he said, and came out from her hole, and knew her benefactor again, and was so distressed at the situation in which she found him, that she immediately thought of some contrivance to release him, and went and stung the son of the king; and the king called together the wise men of his kingdom, who endeavored to charm the bite by their incantations and magical arts, but all to no purpose. Now the serpent had a sister, who was one of the Genii; so she went to her, and informed her of the kindness she had experienced from the traveler, and of the misfortune into which he was fallen; and the sister felt pity for him, and went to the king's son, and rendering herself invisible told him that he would not get well, unless the man who had been punished so undeservedly pronounced an incantation over him. Then the serpent went to the traveler in prison, and reproached him for not having attended to her advice concerning the goldsmith; and she gave him leaves, which she told him served as an antidote to her poison, and desired him, when he was called to charm the bite which the king's son had received, to make the young prince drink a decoction of the leaves, which would cure him; and if the king enquired into his circumstances, he must give a true account of himself, and by the favor of heaven he would by these means escape. Then the king's son told his father, that he had heard the voice of someone speaking, who said to him, that he would not get well, unless the man who had been unjustly imprisoned charmed the sting of the serpent; upon which the king ordered the traveler to be sent for, and desired him to charm his son. The traveler replied, ""Incantations will be of no use to him, but if he drinks a decoction of these leaves, he will with the assistance of heaven be cured."" Then he made him drink, and the child got well, to the great joy and satisfaction of his father; and the king desired the traveler to give some account of himself, and the latter related his history. Then the king thanked him, and made him a handsome present, and commanded that the goldsmith should be put to death in his stead; and the sentence was carried into execution, as a just punishment for the false evidence which he had given, and the bad return he had made to a good action. So in the ingratitude of the goldsmith towards the traveler, and the gratitude on the other hand of the beasts towards their benefactor, by the means of one of whom he escaped from the danger which threatened him, is contained a salutary lesson for those who will listen to instruction, and matter of reflection for the considerate man, who will learn from this example to select, from motives of prudence as well as interest, those only as objects of his generosity and favor, who are possessed of integrity and honorable sentiments, in whatever rank or condition of life he may find them.",Kalila and Dimna,"Source: Kalila and Dimna; or, The Fables of Bidpai, translated from the Arabic by Wyndham Knatchbull (Oxford: Printed by W.

The Grateful Animals and the Ungrateful Man,0160,Vitalis and the Woodcutter,"His name was Vitalis; and when he was on the point of giving his daughter in marriage, he went into a large forest near the sea to provide delicacies for the table. As he wandered alone through the forest, with his bow and arrows ready, and intent on taking venison, he suddenly fell into a pitfall which had been cunningly set for the lions, bears, and wolves, out of which he found it impossible to escape, because the bottom of it was so wide and the mouth so narrow. Here he found two fierce animals, a lion and a serpent, which had also by accident fallen in; and Vitalis signing himself with the cross, neither of them, though fierce and hungry, ventured to attack him. All that night he spent in this pit, crying and moaning, and expecting with lamentations the approach of so base a death. A poor woodcutter, passing by chance that way to collect faggots, heard his cries, which seemed to come from beneath the ground, and following the sound till he came to the pit's mouth, he looked in and called out, ""Who is there?"" Vitalis sprang up, rejoiced beyond measure, and eagerly replied, ""It is I, Vitalis, a Venetian, who knowing nothing of these pitfalls, fell in, and shall be devoured by wild beasts, besides which I am dying of hunger and terror. There are two fierce animals here, a lion and a serpent, but, by God's protection and the sign of the cross, they have not yet hurt me, and it remains for you to save me, that I may afterwards show you my gratitude. If you will save me, I will give you half of all my property, namely, five hundred talents; for I am worth a thousand."" The poor man answered, ""I will do as you request, if you will be as good as your word."" Upon this Vitalis pledged himself on oath to do as he had promised. Whilst they were speaking, the lion by a bland movement of his tail, and the serpent by a gentle hissing, signified to the poor man their approbation, and seemed to join in Vitalis's request to be delivered. The poor man immediately went home for a ladder and ropes, with which he returned and let the ladder down into the pit, without anyone to help him. Immediately the lion and serpent, striving which should be first, mounted by the rounds of the ladder and gave thanks to the poor man, crouching at his feet, for their deliverance. The woodcutter, approaching Vitalis, kissed his hand, saying, ""Long live this hand! I am glad to say that I have earned my bargain,"" and with these words he conducted Vitalis until they came to a road with which he was acquainted. When they parted, the poor man asked when and where Vitalis would discharge his promise. ""Within four days,"" said Vitalis, ""in Venice, in my own palace, which is well known and easy to find."" The countryman returned home to dinner, and as he was sitting at table, the lion entered with a dead goat, as a present in return for his deliverance, and having laid it down, took his leave without doing any hurt. The countryman, however, wishing to see where so tame an animal lay, followed him to his den, the lion all the time licking his feet, and then came back to his dinner. The serpent now came also, and brought with him in his mouth a precious stone which he laid in the countryman's plate. The same proceedings again took place as before. After two or three days the rustic, carrying the jewel with him, went to Venice, to claim from Vitalis his promise. He found him feasting with his neighbors in joy for his deliverance and said to him, ""Friend, pay me what you owe me."" ""Who art thou!"" replied Vitalis, ""and what dost thou want!"" ""I want the five hundred talents you promised me."" ""Do you expect,"" replied Vitalis, ""to get so easily the money which I have had so much difficulty to amass!"" and, as he said these words, he ordered his servants to cast the rash man into prison. But the rustic by a sudden spring escaped out of the house and told what had happened to the judges of the city. When, however, they were a little incredulous, he showed them the jewel which the serpent had given him, and immediately one of them, perceiving that it was of great value, bought it of the man at a high price. But the countryman further proved the truth of his words by conducting some of the citizens to the dens of the lion and the serpent, when the animals again fawned on him as before. The judges were thus convinced of his truth, and compelled Vitalis to fulfil the promise which he had given, and to make compensation for the injury which he had done the poor man.

The Grateful Dead,0505,Sila Tsarevich and Ivashka with the White Smock,"But Chotei said, ""My dear son, you are still young, and not used to the difficulties of traveling; remain at home, and think no more of this fancy you have taken."" But Sila Tsarevich had a great longing to see foreign lands, and entreated his father so much that at length the tsar consented, and gave him a ship likewise. As soon as the three brothers embarked, each on board his ship, they all gave orders to set sail. And when they were out on the open sea, the eldest brother's ship sailed first, the second brother's next, and Sila Tsarevich sailed last. On the third day of the voyage they saw a coffin with iron bands floating on the waves. The two eldest brothers sailed past without heeding it, but as soon as Sila Tsarevich saw the coffin, he ordered the sailors to pick it up, lay it on board his ship, and carry it to land. The next day a violent storm arose, by which Sila's ship was driven out of its course, and cast upon a steep shore in an unknown country. Then Sila ordered his sailors to take the coffin and to carry it on shore, whither he himself followed, and buried it in the earth. Thereupon Sila Tsarevich ordered the captain to remain upon the spot where the ship was stranded, and await his return for three years; but adding that, should he not come back in that time, he should be free to set sail and return home. So saying, Sila took leave of his captain and his crew, and went forthwith, journeying on and on. He wandered about for a long while, without seeing anyone; at length he heard a man running after him, dressed all in white. Then Sila Tsarevich turned round and saw the man following him; whereupon he instantly drew his sword to be upon his guard. But no sooner did the man come up to him than he fell on his knees and thanked Sila for having saved him. And Sila asked the man what he had done to deserve his thanks. Then the stranger stood up and answered, ""Ah, Sila Tsarevich, how can I thank you enough? There I lay in the coffin, which you picked up at sea and buried; and had it not been for you I might have remained floating about for a hundred years."" ""But how did you get into the coffin?"" asked Sila. ""Listen, and I will tell you the whole story,"" replied Ivashka. ""I was a great magician; my mother was told that I did great mischief to mankind by my arts, and therefore ordered me to be put into the coffin and set adrift on the open sea. For more than a hundred years I have been floating about, and no one has ever picked me up; but to you I owe my rescue, and I will therefore serve you, and render you all the help in my power. Let me ask you whether you have not a wish to marry. I know the beautiful Queen Truda, who is worthy of being your wife."" Sila replied that if this queen were indeed beautiful, he was willing to marry her; and Ivashka told him she was the most beautiful woman in the world. When Sila heard this, he begged Ivashka to accompany him to her kingdom. So they set out and traveled on and on till they reached that country. Now, Queen Truda's kingdom was surrounded by a palisade; and upon every stake was stuck a man's head, except one, which had no head. When Sila saw this, he was terrified, and asked Ivashka what it meant; and Ivashka told him that these were the heads of heroes who had been suitors to Queen Truda. Sila shuddered on hearing this, and wished to return home without showing himself to the father of Truda. But Ivashka told him to fear nothing and go with him boldly, so Sila went on. When they entered the kingdom, Ivashka said, ""Hearken Sila Tsarevich, I will be your servant, and when you enter the royal halls, salute King Salom humbly. Then he will ask you whence you came, and whose son you are, what is your name and business. Tell him everything and conceal nothing; but say that you are come to sue for his daughter's hand. He will give her to you with great joy."" So Sila Tsarevich went into the palace, and, as soon as Prince Salom saw him, he went himself to meet him, took him by his white hands, led him into the marble halls, and asked him, ""Fair youth, from what country do you come, whose son are you, what is your name, and what is your business?"" ""I am from the kingdom of my father the Tsar Chotei,"" replied Sila. ""My name is Sila Tsarevich, and I am come to sue for your daughter, the beautiful Queen Truda."" King Salom was overjoyed that the son of such a renowned tsar should be his son-in-law, and immediately ordered his daughter to prepare for the wedding. And when the day for the marriage came, the king commanded all his princes and boyars to assemble in the palace; and they all went in procession to the church, and Sila Tsarevich was married to the fair Queen Truda. Then they returned to the palace, seated themselves at table, and feasted and made merry. When the time came to retire to rest, Ivashka took Sila aside and whispered to him, ""Hark, ye, Sila Tsarevich, when you go to rest, beware lest you speak a word to your bride or you will not remain alive, and your head will be stuck on the last stake. She will in every way try to make you embrace her, but attend to what I say."" Then Sila Tsarevich enquired why he warned him thus, and Ivashka replied, ""She is in league with an evil spirit, who comes to her every night in the shape of a man, but flies through the air in the shape of a six-headed dragon. Now, if she lays her hand upon your breast and presses it, jump up and beat her with a stick until all her strength is gone. I will meanwhile remain on watch at the door of your apartment."" When Sila Tsarevich heard this, he went with his wife to rest, and Queen Truda tried in every way to get him to kiss her, but Sila lay quite still and spoke not a word. Then Truda laid her hand upon his breast and pressed him so hard that he could scarcely breathe. But up jumped Sila Tsarevich and seized the stick which Ivashka had laid there ready for him, and fell to beating her as hard as he could. On a sudden there arose a storm, and a six-headed dragon came flying into the room and was going to devour Sila Tsarevich, but Ivashka seized a sharp sword and attacked the dragon, and they fought three hours, and Ivashka struck off two of the dragon's heads, whereupon the monster flew away. Then Ivashka desired Sila Tsarevich to go to sleep and fear nothing. Sila obeyed him, laid himself down, and fell asleep. Early in the morning King Salom went to be informed whether his dear son still lived, and when he heard that Sila was alive and well, the king rejoiced, since he was the first who had been saved from his daughter; and he instantly ordered Sila to be called, and the whole day was spent in merrymaking. The following night Ivashka gave Sila Tsarevich the same caution as before, not to speak a word to his wife, and he placed himself on watch at the door. Then it fell out as before, and when Sila Tsarevich began to beat the queen, on a sudden the dragon came flying in, and was going to devour Sila Tsarevich. But Ivashka rushed from behind the door, sword in hand, and fought with the dragon and struck off two more of his heads. Then the dragon flew away, and Sila Tsarevich lay down to sleep. Early in the morning the king commanded Sila to be invited, and they spent this day in the same pleasures as before. The third night the same happened again, and Ivashka cut off the last two heads of the dragon, and he burnt all the heads and strewed the ashes in the fields. Thus time passed on, and Sila Tsarevich lived with his father-in-law a whole year, without speaking to his wife or gaining her love. Then Ivashka told him one day to go to King Salom and ask permission to return to his native country. So Sila went to the king, who dismissed him, and gave him two squadrons of his army to accompany him as an escort. Then Sila took leave of his father-in-law, and set out with his wife on their journey to his own country. When they had gone half way, Ivashka told Sila Tsarevich to halt and pitch his tent. So Sila obeyed and ordered the tent to be put up. The next day Ivashka laid pieces of wood in front of Sila's tent and set fire to them. Then he led Queen Truda out of the tent, unsheathed his sword, and cut her in twain. Sila Tsarevich shuddered with terror and began to weep; but Ivashka said, ""Weep not, she will come to life again."" And presently all sorts of evil things came forth from the body, and Ivashka threw them all into the fire. Then he said to Sila Tsarevich, ""See you not the evil spirits which troubled your wife? She is now relieved from them."" And, so saying, he laid the parts of Truda's body together, sprinkled them with the water of life, and the queen was instantly sound and whole as before. Then said Ivashka, ""Now, farewell, Sila Tsarevich, you will find that your wife loves you truly, but you will never see me more."" And so saying he vanished. Sila Tsarevich ordered the tent to be struck, and journeyed on to his native country. And when he came to the place where his ship was waiting for him, he went onboard with the fair Queen Truda, dismissed the escort which accompanied him, and set sail. And on arriving at his own kingdom, he was welcomed with salvos of cannon, and Tsar Chotei came out of his palace and took him and the beautiful Queen Truda by their lily-white hands, led them into the marble halls, placed them at table, and they feasted and made merry. Sila Tsarevich lived with his father two years. Then he returned to the kingdom of King Salom, received from him the crown, and ruled over the country with his Queen Truda in great love and happiness.",Russia,"Source: Robert Steele, The Russian Garland of Fairy Tales: Being Russian Folk Legends Translated from a Collection of Chapbooks Made in Moscow (New York: Robert M.

The Grateful Dead,0505,The Three Pennies,"The soldier stopped, looked at them, and said, ""Where are you going?"" ""I will tell you,"" answered one of them. ""Today there was buried a man who owed each of us one penny, and now we will dig him up, since we are determined upon getting our dues."" ""What an idea!"" returned the soldier. ""You had better leave the dead man alone. At any rate, he is at present unable to pay you even one penny, so don't disturb his peace!"" ""It is all very fine for you to talk,"" answered the man. ""But we must have the money, and up he must come."" When the soldier felt that his fair words could not settle the matter, he said, ""Here, I have two pennies. Will you take them and promise to leave the dead man undisturbed?"" ""Two pennies are not to be refused,"" said the man again, ""but they will pay only two of us. What can you give the third one, since he is bent upon having his share?"" As the soldier saw that there was no dealing with these three wretches, he resumed, ""Since you are so desperately determined, here is my third and last penny. Take it, and be content."" Now all three were well satisfied, so they pursued their way with the three pennies in their pockets. When the soldier had advanced a distance, a stranger came walking along. He looked rather pale, but saluted the soldier in a very civil manner, and followed him along the road without uttering a single sound. At last they reached a church, and here the stranger turned to his companion, saying, ""Let us walk in!"" The soldier looked wistfully at him, and answered, ""That would not do. What business have we in the church at midnight?"" ""I tell you,"" replied the stranger, ""we must walk in!"" Upon this they entered the church and walked straight up to the altar. There was an old woman sitting with a burning light in her hand. ""Take a hair from her head, and smell at it!"" commanded the stranger. The soldier complied, but nothing remarkable happened. The stranger asked him to repeat the action, which he did; but there was no effect. The third time, however, when he tore a whole tuft of hair from the woman's head, she became so furious that she darted off, out above the church, carrying the whole leaden vault with her. The two men went out of the church and down to the beach, where they found the whole leaden vault. Turning to the soldier, the stranger said, ""Sit up. We will put to sea!"" ""Is that so?"" remarked the soldier, who understood nothing of all this. ""I see no ship, however."" ""Let me manage it all,"" says the stranger. ""Just seat yourself by me on the vault! Beyond the sea there is a princess of whom it was predicted that she would be married only to a man who should come across the sea in a leaden ship. Here you will be able to make your fortune."" The leaden vault now floated out upon the open sea, and landed them safely on the other side. Great was the joy and happiness throughout the country, and the marriage between the soldier and the princess was celebrated with such pomp and splendor as was never seen, before or after. When the ceremony had been performed, and the carriage was standing in front of the church door, bride and groom entered, with the stranger who had followed the soldier all along. The coachman asked to what place he might drive them. ""Drive away, as fast as you can, towards the side where the sun will rise,"" said the stranger, and in a little while they were carried along at a furious rate. Somewhere they saw a large herd of cattle. They stopped, and the soldier called the herdsman to the carriage door, asking who he was. ""I am the Count of Ravensburg,"" answered the shepherd, ""and yonder is my castle."" The stranger again bid the coachman drive as fast as possible. In a little while they rushed up to Ravensburg Castle. As they were ready to alight from the carriage, there was someone who knocked hard at the gate. It was the herdsman, who was anxious to come in. The stranger walked to the gate, inquiring what, he could do for him. He wished to come into the castle, he said, for it belonged to him, and he had a right to demand admittance. The stranger meditated a little, whereupon he told the herdsman, who was a conjurer, that he might be allowed to come in, but first he must suffer the whole fate of the rye. ""The fate of the rye!"" repeated the conjurer. ""What do you mean by that?"" ""I mean,"" answered the stranger, ""that next fall you must be sown deep in the ground, and towards spring, when you come up, you must ripen in the sunshine and grow in the rain until you are ready for the harvest. Then you will be mowed and dried, and kept in the barn, until at length you will be threshed."" ""How is that!"" cried the conjurer. ""Am I to be threshed?"" ""Of course you are,"" replied the stranger. ""First you will be threshed, and then taken to the mill and ground."" ""Ground, too!"" shouted the conjurer. ""Will I be ground also?""

Hand from the Grave,0779,A Child's Hand That Wrongly Attacked a Mother Grows Out of the Grave,"In the beginning of the fourteenth century a poor widow lived just outside the Doven Gate [in Bremen] in the vicinity of Jodenberg. She occupied a cottage that had been given to her by the wealthy Frau Schwanke, the wife of Conrad von Verden. For many long years she had served Frau Schwanke's parents as a faithful and industrious maid, and for this reason Frau Schwanke provided her with various means of support, even in her old age. To be sure, the old widow had a daughter who was married to a wealthy tanner in the city, but the daughter had a hard and proud personality, and when the council at that time gave tanners the right to have their own guild in the future, the devil of arrogance so overcame the tanner-master's wife that she became ashamed of her mother, and in the end she even forbade her to enter her house. The old woman was slow and frail, and she could no longer manage to provide for herself, even by spinning. She would have perished had it not been for the help of others. But this help came to a terrible end when Conrad von Verden, who together with his wealthy cousins had committed a number of acts of violence, was driven from the city along with all of his relatives. The old woman could no longer take her pot to Frau Schwanke to get leftovers from their noon meal, as she had been accustomed to do for a year and a day. Bitter necessity now drove her to turn to her daughter for charity. It was a difficult step for her. With a shaking hand she reached for the staff which for a long time now she had been forced to rely on to support her unsteady gait. Underway she stopped several times. She feared an angry confrontation with her daughter, and reflected if it would not be better to take her problems to someone other than her own child. Suddenly she found herself standing in front of her son-in-law's house. She hesitated another moment, then took courage and stepped inside. ""After all, she is my daughter, my only child,"" she murmured quietly to herself. ""God and Saint Willhadus will soften her harshness."" She entered the parlor, where the entire family had gathered to eat their noon meal. At first she was very embarrassed, standing there in her poor clothing surrounded by expensive household furnishings and utensils, and she struggled unsuccessfully for words with which to express her plea. Having collected herself somewhat, she most movingly described in simple and unassuming language the hopelessness of her plight. Tears came to her son-in-law's eyes, but he was a weak man who was completely dominated by his wife, and for nothing in the world would he have made an independent decision, directed only by his heart. He would have taken the helpless old woman into his house with pleasure, if it had depended upon him alone. But as it was, he cast a questioning glance toward his wife to assure himself of her approval. Fear overcame him when he saw her face. It was nothing new for him that she should become angry, even in unimportant matters, but never before had he seen such fury, such an ugly distortion of her features. It was as though upon the sight of her mother she had become possessed of an evil spirit. The redness of her raging anger gave way to a corpse-like paleness. With sparking animal-like eyes she appeared to want to penetrate the being to whom she owed her life and existence and who had protected her with maternal nurture in her youth and had cared for her in sickness. Terrified, the old woman looked around for a chair, for her strength threatened to leave her. For a moment the man's human feelings overcame his fear of his wife, and he rushed forward to catch the half-unconscious woman. Until now the tanner-master's wife had sat there quietly without saying a word, or without even moving. But now her anger suddenly exploded like a crashing thunder-storm that had been threatening in the skies for some time. With superhuman strength she pushed her husband aside and like a wild animal threw herself furiously at her own mother, in order to punish her for having dared to come here, although she had been expressly forbidden to do so. Striking at her with her fists, she finally drove her out of the parlor door. The old woman lay on the hallway floor with her face to the ground. She did not move, and the daughter's demands that she stand up were in vain. The daughter's unnatural anger suddenly dissipated at this pitiful sight. It was as though a curtain had been drawn from her eyes and that she could finally see whom she had directed her blind fury against. ""Mother!"" she cried, horrified at what she had done. ""Forgive me! Come to your sinful and repentant daughter. Before God and all the saints, if the most tender attention and the most loving care can erase this terrible sin from your memory, then you shall forget it."" Gripped by the deepest sympathy, she bent over the unfortunate woman in order to lift her up. She wanted never again to be separated from her, never again to cause her concern. But this change of disposition came too late, and with horror she saw that she was wasting her loving caresses on a corpse. The tanner-master's wife was spared by an earthly judge, for it was determined that the old woman did not die only as a result of the attack, but even more from fear and terror. But there is also a judge who dwells above the clouds who does not make his determinations according to earthly expectations and sophistry. The tanner-master's wife died suddenly thereafter, and a few days after her burial, the gravedigger noticed with horror that the buried woman's hands -- with which she had attacked her mother -- were extending from the grave. And this miracle can be seen to this day, eternalized in stone in the ambulatory of the cathedral.",Friederich Wagenfeld,"Source: Friederich Wagenfeld, ""Kindeshand, die sich an der Mutter vergreift, wächst zum Grabe heraus,"" Bremer Volkssagen, 2nd ed., edited by Karl Eichwald (Bremen: Verlag von Karl Tannen, 1878), no. 2, pp. 9-13.

Finally they beat it with a switch, thinking that it would then return to beneath the earth, but that did not help. Therefore they chopped off the hand, put the switch in its fist, and placed it in the church at Lunow as an eternal warning to godless children. About four hundred years ago in Heidelberg it happened that a hand grew out of the grave of a newly buried child, who was eight years old. In response to this miracle the clergy conducted prayers and processions and investigated the child's life, discovering that he had often struck his parents. His mother was now sentenced to make up for the delayed discipline.

After the burial the child broke through his coffin and stuck his right arm out of the grave, causing fear and amazement among the people. The parents attempted everything to get their child to pull his arm back, but nothing helped. Finally someone said to the deeply concerned parents, ""You spared the rod too much. As punishment for this, the mother must go to the grave every day and beat the hand with a switch until he pulls it back.""

Hand from the Grave,0779,The Hand on the Grave,"Beneath the tablet there is an iron chain, about a half yard long, from which is hanging a human hand, which was cut off at its root. Its color is ashen gray; its skin and flesh are totally dry. The following legend is told about it: Before the Thirty Years' War there lived in Groß-Rebensleben a pious man who had a very wayward son. This son not only ridiculed his father's admonitions, but his belligerence went so far that he abused his own father. Once he even lifted his hand against him as the father was praying to God for his repentance. And it came to pass that the wayward son suddenly fell dead to the earth, as a visible sign that Heaven would not allow his wickedness to go unpunished. He was buried the next day, and then an even greater miracle occurred. Suddenly a hand appeared from the grave, the same hand with which he had struck his father, as if it could find no rest beneath the earth. All who saw this happen fled in terror, and no one dared return to the churchyard, for the hand did not return to beneath the earth. It was a gruesome sight, the way it extended from the grave, stiff, pale, cold, and silent, but still an articulate witness as to how the Lord punishes sin. At last the authorities ordered that the hand be whipped with switches, in the belief that such a punishment would suffice and would lead to redemption. The order was carried out, and the hand bled until the earth turned red, but it would not return to the grave. Then they had it chopped off and hung it in the church with the tablet described above so that it could serve as a lesson for future generations.",J. D. H.

Hand from the Grave,0779,The Parent Murderer of Salzwedel,"More than two hundred years ago, it was on April 15, 1614, that a horrible murder was committed in the old part of Salzwedel just off the street leading to Saint Ann's Convent, that formerly stood there. A merchant's servant by the name of Dietrich Schulze stabbed his father and his mother to death. He stabbed the father four times, and when the mother came to the father's aid, he stabbed her three times. He was sentenced to die, and the sentence was carried out on the fourth of May of the same year. First his right hand, with which he had committed the horrible deed, was cut off. Then he was tortured three times with red-hot pincers, first in the marketplace, second in front of the house where the murder was committed, and finally in the tower itself. Then he was dragged to the place of execution and placed on the wheel upside down, half sitting and half lying.

He had scarcely left the village when a little man came his way who asked him where he was going. Bruhnke told him, and the little man replied that he had just passed the boys, who were passing the time by playing a game. Bruhnke was relieved, but as he took leave of the little man, he noticed that the latter had a hen's foot. He ran as fast as his feet would carry him to the herding place, but it was too late. The head of one of the herders was already dancing on the ground. The boys had wanted to see how beheading went. To this end they built themselves an actual guillotine, fastening an old blade from a straw cutter onto a platform to serve as an ax. They all tried it, but just as they tied the last one to the block, a three-legged hare came limping by, and the boys ran after it, completely forgetting their comrade and the cattle. The prisoner tried to free himself of his bonds, but his motions released the blade, and the unfortunate boy paid for his game with his life.",Germany/Poland,"Source: Otto Knoop, ""Knaben probiren das Köpfen,"" Volkssagen, Erzählungen, Aberglauben, Gebräuche und Märchen aus dem östlichen Hinterpommern (Posen: Verlag von Joseph Jolowicz, 1885), no. 41, pp. 24-25.",NA,Translated by D.

The young lady did laugh as she passed by, to the great amusement of the assembled company; but as when she was already some distance off their friend did not move, the others laughed louder than ever.

"Hansel and Gretel, and 
other type 
327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,Hansel and Gretel,"Next to a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and his two children. The boy's name was Hansel and the girl's name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great famine came to the land, he could no longer provide even their daily bread. One evening as he was lying in bed worrying about his problems, he sighed and said to his wife, ""What is to become of us? How can we feed our children when we have nothing for ourselves?"" ""Man, do you know what?"" answered the woman. ""Early tomorrow morning we will take the two children out into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of them a little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them."" ""No, woman,"" said the man. ""I will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."" ""Oh, you fool,"" she said, ""then all four of us will starve. All you can do is to plane the boards for our coffins."" And she gave him no peace until he agreed. ""But I do feel sorry for the poor children,"" said the man. The two children had not been able to fall asleep because of their hunger, and they heard what the stepmother had said to the father. Gretel cried bitter tears and said to Hansel, ""It is over with us!"" ""Be quiet, Gretel,"" said Hansel, ""and don't worry. I know what to do."" And as soon as the adults had fallen asleep, he got up, pulled on his jacket, opened the lower door, and crept outside. The moon was shining brightly, and the white pebbles in front of the house were glistening like silver coins. Hansel bent over and filled his jacket pockets with them, as many as would fit. Then he went back into the house and said, ""Don't worry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will not forsake us."" Then he went back to bed. At daybreak, even before sunrise, the woman came and woke the two children. ""Get up, you lazybones. We are going into the woods to fetch wood."" Then she gave each one a little piece of bread, saying, ""Here is something for midday. Don't eat it any sooner, for you'll not get any more."" Gretel put the bread under her apron, because Hansel's pockets were full of stones. Then all together they set forth into the woods. After they had walked a little way, Hansel began stopping again and again and looking back toward the house. The father said, ""Hansel, why are you stopping and looking back? Pay attention now, and don't forget your legs."" ""Oh, father,"" said Hansel, ""I am looking at my white cat that is sitting on the roof and wants to say good-bye to me."" The woman said, ""You fool, that isn't your cat. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."" However, Hansel had not been looking at his cat but instead had been dropping the shiny pebbles from his pocket onto the path. When they arrived in the middle of the woods, the father said, ""You children gather some wood, and I will make a fire so you won't freeze."" Hansel and Gretel gathered together some twigs, a pile as high as a small mountain The twigs were set afire, and when the flames were burning well, the woman said, ""Lie down by the fire and rest. We will go into the woods to cut wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you."" Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire. When midday came each one ate his little piece of bread. Because they could hear the blows of an ax, they thought that the father was nearby. However, it was not an ax. It was a branch that he had tied to a dead tree and that the wind was beating back and forth. After they had sat there a long time, their eyes grew weary and closed, and they fell sound sleep. When they finally awoke, it was dark at night. Gretel began to cry and said, ""How will we get out of woods?"" Hansel comforted her, ""Wait a little until the moon comes up, and then we'll find the way."" After the full moon had come up, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. They walked throughout the entire night, and as morning was breaking, they arrived at the father's house. They knocked on the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, ""You wicked children, why did you sleep so long in the woods? We thought that you did not want to come back."" But the father was overjoyed when he saw his children once more, for he had not wanted to leave them alone. Not long afterward there was once again great need everywhere, and one evening the children heard the mother say to the father, ""We have again eaten up everything. We have only a half loaf of bread, and then the song will be over. We must get rid of the children. We will take them deeper into the woods, so they will not find their way out. Otherwise there will be no help for us."" The man was very disheartened, and he thought, ""It would be better to share the last bit with the children."" But the woman would not listen to him, scolded him, and criticized him. He who says A must also say B, and because he had given in the first time, he had to do so the second time as well. The children were still awake and had overheard the conversation. When the adults were asleep, Hansel got up again and wanted to gather pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. But he comforted his little sister and said, ""Don't cry, Gretel. Sleep well. God will help us."" Early the next morning the woman came and got the children from their beds. They received their little pieces of bread, even less than the last time. On the way to the woods, Hansel crumbled his piece in his pocket, then often stood still, and threw crumbs onto the ground. ""Hansel, why are you always stopping and looking around?"" said his father. ""Keep walking straight ahead."" ""I can see my pigeon sitting on the roof. It wants to say good-bye to me."" ""Fool,"" said the woman, ""that isn't your pigeon. That's the morning sun shining on the chimney."" But little by little Hansel dropped all the crumbs onto the path. The woman took them deeper into the woods than they had ever been in their whole lifetime. Once again a large fire was made, and the mother said, ""Sit here, children. If you get tired you can sleep a little. We are going into the woods to cut wood. We will come and get you in the evening when we are finished."" When it was midday Gretel shared her bread with Hansel, who had scattered his piece along the path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed, but no one came to get the poor children. It was dark at night when they awoke, and Hansel comforted Gretel and said, ""Wait, when the moon comes up I will be able to see the crumbs of bread that I scattered, and they will show us the way back home."" When the moon appeared they got up, but they could not find any crumbs, for the many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and in the fields had pecked them up. Hansel said to Gretel, ""We will find our way,"" but they did not find it. They walked through the entire night and the next day from morning until evening, but they did not find their way out of the woods. They were terribly hungry, for they had eaten only a few small berries that were growing on the ground. And because they were so tired that their legs would no longer carry them, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep. It was already the third morning since they had left the father's house. They started walking again, but managed only to go deeper and deeper into the woods. If help did not come soon, they would perish. At midday they saw a little snow-white bird sitting on a branch. It sang so beautifully that they stopped to listen. When it was finished it stretched its wings and flew in front of them. They followed it until they came to a little house. The bird sat on the roof, and when they came closer, they saw that the little house was built entirely from bread with a roof made of cake, and the windows were made of clear sugar. ""Let's help ourselves to a good meal,"" said Hansel. ""I'll eat a piece of the roof, and Gretel, you eat from the window. That will be sweet."" Hansel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to see how it tasted, while Gretel stood next to the windowpanes and was nibbling at them. Then a gentle voice called out from inside: But the old woman shook her head and said, ""Oh, you dear children, who brought you here? Just come in and stay with me. No harm will come to you."" She took them by the hand and led them into her house. Then she served them a good meal: milk and pancakes with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterward she made two nice beds for them, decked in white. Hansel and Gretel went to bed, thinking they were in heaven. But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly. She was a wicked witch who was lying in wait there for children. She had built her house of bread only in order to lure them to her, and if she captured one, she would kill him, cook him, and eat him; and for her that was a day to celebrate. Witches have red eyes and cannot see very far, but they have a sense of smell like animals, and know when humans are approaching. When Hansel and Gretel came near to her, she laughed wickedly and spoke scornfully, ""Now I have them. They will not get away from me again."" Early the next morning, before they awoke, she got up, went to their beds, and looked at the two of them lying there so peacefully, with their full red cheeks. ""They will be a good mouthful,"" she mumbled to herself. Then she grabbed Hansel with her withered hand and carried him to a little stall, where she locked him behind a cage door. Cry as he might, there was no help for him. Then she shook Gretel and cried, ""Get up, lazybones! Fetch water and cook something good for your brother. He is locked outside in the stall and is to be fattened up. When he is fat I am going to eat him."" Gretel began to cry, but it was all for nothing. She had to do what the witch demanded. Now Hansel was given the best things to eat every day, but Gretel received nothing but crayfish shells. Every morning the old woman crept out to the stall and shouted, ""Hansel, stick out your finger, so I can feel if you are fat yet."" But Hansel stuck out a little bone, and the old woman, who had bad eyes and could not see the bone, thought it was Hansel's finger, and she wondered why he didn't get fat. When four weeks had passed and Hansel was still thin, impatience overcame her, and she would wait no longer. ""Hey, Gretel!"" she shouted to the girl, ""Hurry up and fetch some water. Whether Hansel is fat or thin, tomorrow I am going to slaughter him and boil him."" Oh, how the poor little sister sobbed as she was forced to carry the water, and how the tears streamed down her cheeks! ""Dear God, please help us,"" she cried. ""If only the wild animals had devoured us in the woods, then we would have died together."" ""Save your slobbering,"" said the old woman. ""It doesn't help you at all."" The next morning Gretel had to get up early, hang up the kettle with water, and make a fire. ""First we are going to bake,"" said the old woman. ""I have already made a fire in the oven and kneaded the dough."" She pushed poor Gretel outside to the oven, from which fiery flames were leaping. ""Climb in,"" said the witch, ""and see if it is hot enough to put the bread in yet."" And when Gretel was inside, she intended to close the oven, and bake her, and eat her as well. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, so she said, ""I don't know how to do that. How can I get inside?"" ""Stupid goose,"" said the old woman. The opening is big enough. See, I myself could get in."" And she crawled up stuck her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a shove, causing her to fall in. Then she closed the iron door and secured it with a bar. The old woman began to howl frightfully. But Gretel ran away, and the godless witch burned up miserably. Gretel ran straight to Hansel, unlocked his stall, and cried, ""Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead."" Then Hansel jumped out, like a bird from its cage when someone opens its door. How happy they were! They threw their arms around each other's necks, jumped with joy, and kissed one another. Because they now had nothing to fear, they went into the witch's house. In every corner were chests of pearls and precious stones. ""These are better than pebbles,"" said Hansel, filling his pockets. Gretel said, ""I will take some home with me as well,"" and she filled her apron full. ""But now we must leave,"" said Hansel, ""and get out of these witch-woods."" After walking a few hours they arrived at a large body of water. ""We cannot get across,"" said Hansel. ""I cannot see a walkway or a bridge."" ""There are no boats here,"" answered Gretel, ""but there is a white duck swimming. If I ask it, it will help us across."" Then she called out: ""No,"" answered Gretel. ""That would be too heavy for the duckling. It should take us across one at a time."" That is what the good animal did, and when they were safely on the other side, and had walked on a little while, the woods grew more and more familiar to them, and finally they saw the father's house in the distance. They began to run, rushed inside, and threw their arms around the father's neck. The man had not had even one happy hour since he had left the children in the woods. However, the woman had died. Gretel shook out her apron, scattering pearls and precious stones around the room, and Hansel added to them by throwing one handful after the other from his pockets. Now all their cares were at an end, and they lived happily together.",Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, ""Hänsel und Grethel,"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen, gesammelt durch die Brüder Grimm [Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales], vol. 1, 7th ed.

Although they state that it derives ""from various stories from Hessen,"" a handwritten marginal note in the Grimms' personal copy of the first edition reveals that in 1813 Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild contributed the children's verse answer to the witch, ""The wind, the wind,/ The heavenly child,"" which rhymes in German: ""Der Wind, der Wind,/ Das himmlische Kind."" It is likely that the Grimms heard the entire story in the Wild household. Wilhelm Grimm married Dortchen Wild in 1825. ""Hansel and Gretel"" is the classic version of an Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 327A tale. The episode of burning the witch in her own oven is classified as type 1121. Notes on the translation: In the first edition the Grimms spell their hero's and heroine's names ""Hänsel"" and ""Gretel."" In the second edition, ""Hänsel"" and ""Grethel."" All modern German editions use the spellings ""Hänsel"" and ""Gretel."" There is no reason to include the Umlaut (whether spelled ""Hänsel"" or ""Haensel"") in an English translation of the name ""Hansel,"" nor is there any justification for an English translator to revert to the obsolete spelling ""Grethel."" The phrase ""die Frau"" occurs fequently in ""Hansel and Gretel,"" especially in the final edition. This phrase can be translated as ""his wife,"" ""the wife,"" ""his woman,"" or ""the woman."" In my judgment, the generic ""the woman"" best fits the story's child's-eye perspective and tone. The traditional translation of the witch's verse query ""Nibble, nibble, little mouse,/ Who is nibbling at my house?"" is too good to abandon, although the original German ""Knuper, knuper, kneischen,/ Wer knupert an meinem Häuschen?"" does not specifically mention a mouse.

The father went to town and bought a scoopful of peas and gave each child one pea, but Jan and Hanna did not get any. This made them cry. The father said, ""Be quiet and don't cry. I am going into the forest to chop wood. You can come along and look for berries."" The father took a breadboard and a rolling pin with him and hung them on a tree. He said to Jan and Hanna, ""Just go and pick berries. You can pick berries as long as I am chopping wood."" The wind blew the breadboard and the rolling pin against each other, and they thought their father was still chopping wood, so they continued to pick berries. After they had eaten until they were full and had filled their little buckets as well, they went and looked for their father. They came to the place where the breadboard and the rolling pin were hanging, but no father was there. They cried, then ran about in the woods shouting, but they did not find anyone. Suddenly they came to a little gingerbread house. They began to crumble off some little pieces: crumble, crumble from Old Vera's little house! Then Old Vera came running out. ""Who's there?"" They quickly hid themselves so she could not find them. But they continued to crumble little pieces off the little house: crumble, crumble from Old Vera's little house. Then she ran out very fast and caught them. She took them inside and said, ""Now I am going to fatten you up,"" and she locked them into a little stall and gave them nothing but bread and milk to eat. After a while she wanted to see if they were fattened up enough. ""Jan, stick out your finger. Are you fattened up yet?"" But he stuck out the little whistle he had brought from home. She made a cut in it. ""Oh, you are not fat enough yet."" ""Hanna, you stick out your finger. Are you fattened up yet?"" But she stuck out a finger that had a ring on it. Old Vera made a cut in the ring. ""Oh, you are not fat enough yet either."" Then they cried a lot, and Jan lost his little whistle, and Hanna lost her ring. Old Vera came again to see if they were fattened up enough. ""Jan, stick out your finger."" Old Vera made a cut in it, and it bled a little. ""Hanna, you stick out your finger."" Old Vera made a cut in it, and it bled a little. ""Yes, you are fattened up enough. Now I am going to roast you."" She heated up her oven very hot, took Jan and Hanna and said, ""Sit on the bread pusher."" They sat on the bread pusher, now this way, and now that way. Vera told them how they were supposed to sit, but every time they fell off. ""We don't know how we are supposed to sit. You show us."" Then Old Vera sat on the bread pusher, and bang! they pushed her into the glowing oven.

She did not want to be separated from her children; but she feared that she would be whipped if she kept them, so she obeyed the cruel order. At first the poor children did not want to go away; but, when they saw that their bad father was going to kick them, they ran off crying. Soon the children came to a wild forest. ""Maria, what will become of us here?"" said Juan. ""I am very hungry,"" said the little girl. ""I don't think that I can get you any food in this wilderness,"" said the kind brother, ""but let me see!"" He then looked around. By good luck he found a guava tree with one small fruit on it. He immediately climbed up for the guava, and gave it to his hungry sister. Then the two children resumed their journey. As they were walking along, Maria found a hen's egg on the grass. She picked it up and carried it along with her in her dirty ragged skirt. At last they saw a very small hut roofed with dry talahib (coarse, long grass). An old woman in the hut welcomed them, and asked them where they were going. After Juan had told her their story, she invited the tired children to stay in the hut with her. She promised that she would treat them as her little son and daughter. From that time on, Juan and Maria lived with the kind old woman. Juan grew to be a strong fine man, and Maria became a beautiful young woman. Juan spent almost all his time hunting in the mountains and woods. One morning he caught a black deer. While he was taking the animal home, the deer said to him, ""Juan, as soon as you reach your home, kill me, eat my flesh, and put my hide in your trunk. After three days open your trunk, and you will see something astonishing."" When Juan reached home, he did as the deer had told him to do. On the third day he found in the trunk golden armor. He was greatly delighted by the precious gift. Maria had not been living long with the old woman when she found that the egg had hatched into a chick, which soon grew into a fine fighting cock. One morning the cock crowed, ""Tok-to-ko-kok! Take me to the cockpit. I'll surely win!"" Maria told the old woman what the cock had said, and the next Sunday Juan took the fighting cock to the cockpit. There the rooster was victorious, and won much money for Juan. One day Juan heard that a tournament would be held in front of the king's palace. The winner of the contest was to become the husband of the princess, and would inherit the throne. Juan quickly put on his golden armor, and hastened to the palace to try his skill. He defeated all his opponents. The next day his bridal ceremony was celebrated, and the crown was placed on his head. That very day he ascended the throne to rule over the kingdom. Although Juan was now king, he was not proud. He and the queen visited Maria to get her to live in the palace; but the old woman would not allow her to go with her brother, as she had no other companion in the hut. One day a prince was lost in the forest. He happened to come across the hut in which Maria was living. He fell in love with her, and wanted to marry her. As the old woman offered no objections to the proposal of the prince, the following day Maria became a queen, just as her brother had become king. Although the parents of Juan and Maria had been very cruel, yet the king and queen did not forget them. The brother and sister visited their father and mother, whom they found in the most wretched condition. When the father saw that his children had become king and queen, he wept greatly for his former cruelty to them.",Philippines,"Source: Dean S.

327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,Little Thumb,"Once upon a time there lived a woodcutter and his wife; they had seven children, all boys. The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven. People were astonished that the woodcutter had had so many children in such a short time, but his wife was very fond of children, and never had less than two at a time They were very poor, and their seven children inconvenienced them greatly, because not one of them was able to earn his own way. They were especially concerned, because the youngest was very sickly. He scarcely ever spoke a word, which they considered to be a sign of stupidity, although it was in truth a mark of good sense. He was very little, and when born no bigger than one's thumb, for which reason they called him Little Thumb. The poor child bore the blame of everything that went wrong in the house. Guilty or not, he was always held to be at fault. He was, notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together. And although he spoke little, he listened well. There came a very bad year, and the famine was so great that these poor people decided to rid themselves of their children. One evening, when the children were all in bed and the woodcutter was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief, ""You see plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I cannot see them starve to death before my face. I am resolved to lose them in the woods tomorrow, which may very easily be done; for, while they are busy in tying up the bundles of wood, we can leave them, without their noticing."" ""Ah!"" cried out his wife; ""and can you yourself have the heart to take your children out along with you on purpose to abandon them?"" In vain her husband reminded her of their extreme poverty. She would not consent to it. Yes, she was poor, but she was their mother. However, after having considered what a grief it would be for her to see them perish with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed in tears. Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as he lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he got up softly, and hid under his father's stool, in order to hear what they were saying without being seen. He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking about what he had to do. He got up early in the morning, and went to the riverside, where he filled his pockets with small white pebbles, and then returned home. They all went out, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew. They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces distance. The woodcutter began his work, and the children gathered up the sticks into bundles. Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, slipped away from them without being seen, and returned home along a byway through the bushes. When the children saw they had been left alone, they began to cry as loudly as they could. Little Thumb let them cry, knowing very well how to get home again, for he had dropped the little white pebbles all along the way. Then he said to them, ""Don't be afraid, brothers. Father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again. Just follow me."" They did so, and he took them home by the very same way they had come into the forest. They dared not go in, but sat down at the door, listening to what their father and mother were saying. The woodcutter and his wife had just arrived home, when the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and which they never expected. This gave them new life, for the poor people were almost famished. The woodcutter sent his wife immediately to the butcher's. As it had been a long while since they had eaten, she bought three times as much meat as would be needed for two people. When they had eaten, the woman said, ""Alas! Where are our poor children now? They would make a good feast of what we have left here; but it was you, William, who decided to abandon them. I told you that we would be sorry for it. What are they now doing in the forest? Alas, dear God, the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up. You are very inhuman to have abandoned your children in this way."" The woodcutter at last lost his patience, for she repeated it more than twenty times, that they would be sorry for it, and that she was right for having said so. He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. It was not that the woodcutter was less upset than his wife, but that she was nagging him. He, like many others, was of the opinion that wives should say the right thing, but that they should not do so too often. She nearly drowned herself in tears, crying out, ""Alas! Where are now my children, my poor children?"" She spoke this so very loud that the children, who were at the gate, began to cry out all together, ""Here we are! Here we are!"" She immediately ran to open the door, and said, hugging them, ""I am so glad to see you, my dear children; you are very hungry and tired. And my poor Peter, you are horribly dirty; come in and let me clean you."" Now, you must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above all the rest, because he had red hair, as she herself did. They sat down to supper and ate with a good appetite, which pleased both father and mother. They told them how frightened they had been in the forest, speaking almost always all together. The parents were extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and decided to abandon them again. This time they resolved to take them much deeper into the forest than before. Although they tried to talk secretly about it, again they were overheard by Little Thumb, who made plans to get out of this difficulty as well as he had the last time. However, even though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles, he could not do so, for he found the door securely bolted and locked. Their father gave each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast, and he fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles, by throwing it in little bits all along the way; and so he put it into his pocket. Their father and mother took them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, then, slipping away by an obscure path, they left them there. Little Thumb was not concerned, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered along the way; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb. The birds had come and had eaten every bit of it up. They were now in great distress, for the farther they went the more lost and bewildered they became. Night now came on, and there arose a terrible high wind, which made them dreadfully afraid. They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up. They scarcely dared to speak or turn their heads. After this, it rained very hard, which drenched them to the skin; their feet slipped at every step they took, and they fell into the mire, getting them muddy all over. Their hands were numb with cold. Little Thumb climbed to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover anything. Turning his head in every direction, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way from the forest. He came down, but from the ground, he could no longer see it no more, which concerned him greatly. However, after walking for some time with his brothers in the direction where he had seen the light, he perceived it again as he came out of the woods. They came at last to the house where this candle was, but not without many fearful moments, for every time they walked down into a hollow they lost sight of it. They knocked at the door, and a good woman opened it. She asked them what they wanted. Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest, and begged her, for God's sake, to give them lodging. The woman, seeing that they were good looking children, began to weep, and said to them, ""Alas, poor babies, where are you from? Do you know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children?"" ""Ah! dear madam,"" answered Little Thumb (who, as well as his brothers, was trembling all over), ""what shall we do? If you refuse to let us sleep here then the wolves of the forest surely will devour us tonight. We would prefer the gentleman to eat us, but perhaps he would take pity upon us, especially if you would beg him to."" The ogre's wife, who believed she could hide them from her husband until morning, let them come in, and had them to warm themselves at a very good fire. There was a whole sheep on the spit, roasting for the ogre's supper. After they warmed up a little, they heard three or four great raps at the door. This was the ogre, who was come home. Hearing him, she hid them under the bed and opened the door. The ogre immediately asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat down at the table. The sheep was still raw and bloody, but he preferred it that way. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying, ""I smell fresh meat."" His wife said, ""You can smell the calf which I have just now killed and flayed."" ""I smell fresh meat, I tell you once more,"" replied the ogre, looking crossly at his wife, ""and there is something here which I do not understand."" As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed. ""Ah, hah!"" he said. ""I see then how you would cheat me, you cursed woman; I don't know why I don't eat you as well. It is fortunate for you that you are tough old carrion. But here is good game, which has luckily arrived just in time to serve to three ogre friends who are coming here to visit in a day or two."" With that he dragged them out from under the bed, one by one. The poor children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon; but they were dealing with one of the cruelest ogres in the world. Far from having any pity on them, he had already devoured them with his eyes. He told his wife that they would be delicate eating with good savory sauce. He then took a large knife, and, approaching the poor children, sharpened it on a large whetstone which he held in his left hand. He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him, ""Why do it now? Is it not tomorrow soon enough?"" ""Hold your chatter,"" said the ogre; ""they will be more tender, if I kill them now."" ""But you have so much meat already,"" replied his wife. ""You have no need for more. Here are a calf, two sheep, and half a hog."" ""That is true,"" said the ogre. ""Feed them so they don't get too thin, and put them to bed."" The good woman was overjoyed at this, and offered them a good supper, but they were so afraid that they could not eat a bit. As for the ogre, he sat down to drink, being highly pleased that now had something special to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary, which went to his head and made him sleepy. The ogre had seven little daughters. These young ogresses all had very fine complexions, because they ate fresh meat like their father; but they had little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, and very long sharp teeth, well spaced from each other. As yet they were not overly mischievous, but they showed great promise for it, for they had already bitten little children in order to suck their blood. They had been put to bed early, all seven in a large bed, and each of them wearing a crown of gold on her head. The ogre's wife gave the seven little boys a bed just as large and in the same room, then she went to bed to her husband. Little Thumb, who had observed that the ogre's daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the ogre should change his mind about not killing them, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers' caps and his own, went very softly and put them on the heads of the seven little ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put on his own head and his brothers', that the ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill. All of this happened according to his plan for, the ogre awakened about midnight and, regretting that he had put off until morning that which he might have done tonight, he hastily got out of bed and picked up his large knife. ""Let us see,"" he said, ""how our little rogues are doing! We'll not make that mistake a second time!"" He then went, groping all the way, into his daughters' room. He came to the bed where the little boys lay. They were all fast asleep except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he felt the ogre feeling about his head, as he had done about his brothers'. Feeling the golden crowns, the ogre said, ""That would have been a terrible mistake. Truly, I did drink too much last night."" Then he went to the bed where the girls lay. Finding the boys' caps on them, he said, ""Ah, hah, my merry lads, here you are. Let us get to work."" So saying, and without further ado, he cut all seven of his daughters' throats. Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife. As soon as Little Thumb heard the ogre snore, he wakened his brothers and told them to put on their clothes immediately and to follow him. They stole softly down into the garden, and climbed over the wall. They kept running nearly the whole night, trembling all the while, and not knowing which way they were going. The ogre, when he awoke, said to his wife, ""Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night."" The ogress was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming how he intended that she should dress them, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put their clothes on them, she went up, and was horribly astonished when she saw her seven daughters with their throats cut and lying in their own blood. She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases. The ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle. ""What have I done?"" he cried. ""Those wretches shall soon pay for this!"" He threw a pitcher of water on his wife's face, and, having brought her to herself, cried, ""Bring me my seven-league boots at once, so that I can catch them."" He went out, and ran this way and that over a vast amount of ground. At last he came to the very road where the poor children were, and not more than a hundred paces from their father's house. They saw the ogre coming, who was stepping from mountain to mountain, and crossing over rivers as easily as if they were little streams. Little Thumb hid himself and his brothers in a nearby hollow rock, all the while keeping watch on the ogre. The ogre was very tired from his long and fruitless journey (for seven-league boots are very tiring to wear), and decided to take a rest. By chance he sat on the rock where the little boys had hid themselves. He was so tired that he fell asleep, and began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he had held up his large knife and was about to cut their throats. However, Little Thumb was not as frightened as his brothers were, and told them that they immediately should run away towards home while the ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not worry about him. They took his advice, and soon reached home. Little Thumb came up to the ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own feet. The boots were very long and large, but because they were enchanted, they became big or little to fit the person who was wearing them. So they fit his feet and legs as well as if they had been custom made for him. He immediately went to the ogre's house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of her murdered daughters. ""Your husband,"" said Little Thumb, ""is in very great danger. He has been captured by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver. At the very moment they were holding their daggers to his throat he saw me, and begged me to come and tell you the condition he is in. You should give me everything he has of value, without keeping back anything at all, for otherwise they will kill him without mercy. Because his case is so very urgent, he lent me his boots (you see I have them on), that I might make the more haste and to show you that he himself has sent me to you."" The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had, for although this ogre ate up little children, he was a good husband. Thus Little Thumb got all the ogre' s money. He returned with it to his father's house, where he was received with great joy. There are many people who do not agree with this last detail. They claim that Little Thumb never robbed the ogre at all, that he only made off with the seven-league boots, and that with a good conscience, because the ogre's only use of them was to pursue little children. These folks affirm that they are quite sure of this, because they have often drunk and eaten at the woodcutter's house. These people claim that after taking off the ogre's boots, Little Thumb went to court, where he learned that there was much concern about the outcome of a certain battle and the condition of a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off. They say that he went to the king, and told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night. The king promised him a great sum of money if he could do so. Little Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with the news. This first feat brought him great fame, and he could then name his own price. Not only did the king pay him very well for carrying his orders to the army, but the ladies of the court paid him handsomely to bring them information about their lovers. Occasionally wives gave him letters for their husbands, but they paid so poorly, that he did not even bother to keep track of the money he made in this branch of his business. After serving as a messenger for some time and thus acquiring great wealth, he went home to his father, where he was received with inexpressible joy.

abandoned children",0327,Molly Whuppie,"They traveled and traveled and could never see a house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a light and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at the door, and a woman came to it, who said, ""What do you want?"" They said, ""Please let us in and give us something to eat."" The woman said, ""I can't do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he comes home."" They begged hard. ""Let us stop for a little while,"" said they, ""and we will go away before he comes."" So she took them in, and set them down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just as they had begun to eat, a great knock came to the door, and a dreadful voice said: ""Eh,"" said the wife, ""it's three poor lassies cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won't touch, 'em, man."" He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to stay all night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to sleep in the same bed with the three strangers. The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie, and she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own lassies' necks, he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure everyone was sleeping sound. Then she slipped out of bed, and took the straw ropes off her own and her sisters' necks, and took the gold chains off the giant's lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant's lassies and the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down. And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great club, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his own lassies out of the bed on to the floor, and battered them until they were dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed finely. Molly thought it time she and her sisters were off and away, so she wakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the house. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped until morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out to be a king's house; so Molly went in, and told her story to the king. He said, ""Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have managed well; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal the giant's sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry."" Molly said she would try. So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant's house, and crept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great supper, and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she crept out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just as she got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the giant, and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the ""Bridge of one hair""; and she got over, but he couldn't and he says, ""Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never ye come again."" And she says: ""Twice yet, carle,"" quoth she, ""I'll come to Spain."" So Molly took the sword to the king, and her sister was married to his son. Well, the king he says, ""Ye've managed well, Molly; but if ye would manage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant's pillow, I would marry your second sister to my second son."" And Molly said she would try. So she set out for the giant's house, and slipped in, and hid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his supper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out and slipped her hand below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was going out the giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he ran, till they came to the ""Bridge of one hair,"" and she got over, but he couldn't, and he said, ""Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come again."" ""Once yet, carle,"" quoth she, ""I'll come to Spain."" So Molly took the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the king's second son. After that the king says to Molly, ""Molly, you are a clever girl, but if you would do better yet, and steal the giant's ring that he wears on his finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself."" Molly said she would try. So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got hold of the giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the hand and he says, ""Now I have caught you, Molly Whuppie; and, if I done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?"" Molly says, ""I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside wi' you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and shears, and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood, and choose the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you down, and bang you till you were dead."" ""Well, Molly,"" says the giant, ""I'll just do that to you. So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog beside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick. Molly she sings out, ""Oh, if ye saw what I see."" ""Oh,"" says the giant's wife, ""what do you see, Molly?"" But Molly never said a word but, ""Oh, if ye saw what I see!"" The giants wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down and helped the giants wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole. The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came the giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the sack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, ""It's me, man""; but the dog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife's voice. But Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her and he ran after her; and he ran, and she ran, till they came to the ""Bridge of one hair,"" and she got over, but he couldn't; and he said, ""Woe worth you, Mollie Whuppie! never you come again."" ""Never more, carle,"" quoth she, ""will I come again to Spain."" So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his youngest son, and she never saw the giant again.",England,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, English Fairy Tales (London: David Nutt, 1890), no. 22, pp. 125-30.","Jacobs' source: W.

327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,Nennillo and Nennella,"There was once a good man named Jannuccio, who had two children, Nennillo and Nennella, whom he loved as much as his own life. But Death having, with the smooth file of Time, severed the prison bars of his wife's soul, he took to himself a cruel woman, who had no sooner set foot in his house than she began to ride the high horse, saying, ""Am I come here indeed to look after other folk's children? A pretty job I have undertaken, to have all this trouble and be for ever teased by a couple of squalling brats! Would that I had broken my neck ere I ever came to this place, to have bad food, worse drink, and get no sleep at night! Here's a life to lead! Forsooth I came as a wife, and not as a servant; but I must find some means of getting rid of these creatures, or it will cost me my life: better to blush once than to grow pale a hundred times; so I've done with them, for I am resolved to send them away, or to leave the house myself forever."" The poor husband, who had some affection for this woman, said to her, ""Softly, wife! Don't be angry, for sugar is dear; and tomorrow morning, before the cock crows, I will remove this annoyance in order to please you."" So the next morning, ere the Dawn had hung out the red counterpane at the window of the East to air it, Jannuccio took the children, one by each hand, and with a good basketful of things to eat upon his arm, he led them to a wood, where an army of poplars and beech trees were holding the shades besieged. Then Jannuccio said, ""My little children, stay here in this wood, and eat and drink merrily; but if you want anything, follow this line of ashes which I have been strewing as we came along; this will be a clue to lead you out of the labyrinth and bring you straight home."" Then giving them both a kiss, he returned weeping to his house. But at the hour when all creatures, summoned by the constables of Night, pay to Nature the tax of needful repose, the two children began to feel afraid at remaining in that lonesome place, where the waters of a river, which was thrashing the impertinent stones for obstructing its course, would have frightened even a hero. So they went slowly along the path of ashes, and it was already midnight ere they reached their home. When Pascozza, their stepmother, saw the children, she acted not like a woman, but a perfect fury; crying aloud, wringing her hands, stamping with her feet, snorting like a frightened horse, and exclaiming, ""What fine piece of work is this? Is there no way of ridding the house of these creatures? Is it possible, husband, that you are determined to keep them here to plague my very life out? Go, take them out of my sight! I'll not wait for the crowing of cocks and the cackling of hens; or else be assured that tomorrow morning I'll go off to my parents' house, for you do not deserve me. I have not brought you so many fine things, only to be made the slave of children who are not my own."" Poor Jannuccio, who saw that matters were growing rather too warm, immediately took the little ones and returned to the wood; where giving the children another basketful of food, he said to them, ""You see, my dears, how this wife of mine -- who is come to my house to be your ruin and a nail in my heart -- hates you; therefore remain in this wood, where the trees, more compassionate, will give you shelter from the sun; where the river, more charitable, will give you drink without poison; and the earth, more kind, will give you a pillow of grass without danger. And when you want food, follow this little path of bran which I have made for you in a straight line, and you can come and seek what you require."" So saying, he turned away his face, not to let himself be seen to weep and dishearten the poor little creatures. When Nennillo and Nennella had eaten all that was in the basket, they wanted to return home; but alas! a jackass -- the son of ill-luck -- had eaten up all the bran that was strewn upon the ground; so they lost their way, and wandered about forlorn in the wood for several days, feeding on acorns and chestnuts which they found fallen on the ground. But as Heaven always extends its arm over the innocent, there came by chance a prince to hunt in that wood. Then Nennillo, hearing the baying of the hounds, was so frightened that he crept into a hollow tree; and Nennella set off running at full speed, and ran until she came out of the wood, and found herself on the seashore. Now it happened that some pirates, who had landed there to get fuel, saw Nennella and carried her off; and their captain took her home with him where he and his wife, having just lost a little girl, took her as their daughter. Meantime Nennillo, who had hidden himself in the tree, was surrounded by the dogs, which made such a furious barking that the prince sent to find out the cause; and when he discovered the pretty little boy, who was so young that he could not tell who were his father and mother, he ordered one of the huntsmen to set him upon his saddle and take him to the royal palace. Then he had him brought up with great care, and instructed in various arts, and among others, he had him taught that of a carver; so that, before three or four years had passed, Nennillo became so expert in his art that he could carve a joint to a hair. Now about this time it was discovered that the captain of the ship who had taken Nennella to his house was a sea-robber, and the people wished to take him prisoner; but getting timely notice from the clerks in the law courts, who were his friends, and whom he kept in his pay, he fled with all his family. It was decreed, however, perhaps by the judgment of Heaven, that he who had committed his crimes upon the sea, upon the sea should suffer the punishment of them; for having embarked in a small boat, no sooner was he upon the open sea than there came such a storm of wind and tumult of the waves, that the boat was upset and all were drowned, all except Nennella, who having had no share in the corsair's robberies, like his wife and children, escaped the danger; for just then a large enchanted fish, which was swimming about the boat, opened its huge throat and swallowed her down. The little girl now thought to herself that her days were surely at an end, when suddenly she found a thing to amaze her inside the fish: beautiful fields and fine gardens, and a splendid mansion, with all that heart could desire, in which she lived like a princess. Then she was carried quickly by the fish to a rock, where it chanced that the prince had come to escape the burning heat of a summer, and to enjoy the cool sea breezes. And whilst a great banquet was preparing, Nennillo had stepped out upon a balcony of the palace on the rock to sharpen some knives, priding himself greatly on acquiring honor from his office. When Nennella saw him through the fish's throat, she cried aloud, At last, hearing the words ""Brother, brother!"" continually repeated, he asked all his servants, one by one, whether any of them had lost a sister. And Nennillo replied, that he recollected, as a dream, having had a sister when the prince found him in the wood, but that he had never since heard any tidings of her. Then the prince told him to go nearer to the fish, and see what was the matter, for perhaps this adventure might concern him. As soon as Nennillo approached the fish, it raised up its head upon the rock, and opening its throat six palms wide, Nennella stepped out, so beautiful that she looked just like a nymph in some interlude, come forth from that animal at the incantation of a magician. And when the prince asked her how it had all happened, she told him a part of her sad story, and the hatred of their stepmother; but not being able to recollect the name of their father nor of their home, the prince caused a proclamation to be issued, commanding that whoever had lost two children, named Nennillo and Nennella, in a wood, should come to the royal palace, and he would there receive joyful news of them. Jannuccio, who had all this time passed a sad and disconsolate life, believing that his children had been devoured by wolves, now hastened with the greatest joy to seek the prince, and told him that he had lost the children. And when he had related the story, how he had been compelled to take them to the wood, the prince gave him a good scolding, calling him a blockhead for allowing a woman to put her heel upon his neck till he was brought to send away two such jewels as his children. But after he had broken Jannuccio's head with these words, he applied to it the plaster of consolation, showing him the children, whom the father embraced and kissed for half an hour without being satisfied. Then the prince made him pull off his jacket, and had him dressed like a lord; and sending for Jannuccio's wife, he showed her those two golden pippins, asked her what that person would deserve who should do them any harm, and even endanger their lives. And she replied, ""For my part, I would put her into a closed cask, and send her rolling down a mountain."" ""So it shall be done!"" said the prince. ""The goat has butted at herself. Quick now! you have passed the sentence, and you must suffer it, for having borne these beautiful stepchildren such malice."" So he gave orders that the sentence should be instantly executed. Then choosing a very rich lord among his vassals, he gave him Nennella to wife, and the daughter of another great lord to Nennillo; allowing them enough to live upon, with their father, so that they wanted for nothing in the world. But the stepmother, shut into the cask and shut out from life, kept on crying through the bunghole as long as she had breath:",Giambattista Basile,"Source: Giambattista Basile, The Pentamerone; or, The Story of Stories, translated from the Neapolitan by John Edward Taylor (London: David Bogue, 1848), day 5, tale 8, pp. 370-78.",NA,NA
"Hansel and Gretel, and 
other type 
327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,Old Grule,"Once upon a time there were a father and a mother who had two children, a girl and a boy. The girl's name was Gretel, and the boy's name was Hans. The children were disobedient, and often received beatings. One day they wanted to go into the woods to pick strawberries, but their mother said, ""You are not allowed to go out today. A thunderstorm is approaching, so you have to stay at home."" But the children did not obey. While their mother was busy working, the children took their little baskets from the wall and went into the woods. There they picked strawberries, but they had scarcely begun when it grew dark. A storm arose that whipped the trees fiercely against each other until the branches came flying down. It began to thunder and lightning, followed by hail and rain. The frightened children were sorry that they had not obeyed their mother and remained at home. Fortunately they found a rocky cave, and they crept inside and waited until the rain stopped. After the thunderstorm had passed, they wanted to go home, but -- oh dear -- they no longer knew the way. They walked and walked, but instead of going out of the woods, they only went deeper and deeper into the woods. They grew terribly afraid and called out, ""Father! Mother!"" but no one heard them. Night fell, and they saw with terror that they would have to sleep in the woods. Then Gretel said, ""Hans, do you know what? Climb a tree. You like to climb trees, and you can look around. Maybe you'll see a light where we can go."" Hans did this, and he did indeed see a light in the distance. He came down from the tree, took Gretel by the hand, and led her in the direction of the light he had seen. When they arrived there, they saw a little house from which the light was glistening. Looking more closely, they found that it was made of gingerbread. The walls were of gingerbread and the roof of marzipan. They looked around for a ladder, and finding one, they leaned it on the roof and climbed up. There they made themselves comfortable and began breaking off one marzipan shingle after the other and eating them, until there was a hole clear through the roof. Now a witch named Grule lived in this little house, and she liked to eat children more than anything else. She was just about to go to bed when she heard something on her roof. Running outside, she said with a deep voice, ""Who is robbing my house?"" ""The wind, the wind,"" was Gretel's reply, with a very gentle voice. Satisfied, she went back inside and went to bed. In the meantime the moon had risen, and when the witch put out her light she noticed a large hole in the roof above her bed, and a child's head looking around. She jumped up, ran outside, pulled the children down from the roof, and said, ""Just wait, you worthless brats. I'll teach you to ruin my house. Get inside. You can't leave."" And with these words she put them in an empty chicken coop and locked the door. The next days, and for some time afterward, the witch brought the children good things to eat, for she wanted to fatten them up in order to have a good roast from them. She brought the children all the things they liked to eat: cake, sweets, fruit, and many other things. When she thought that the children must be fat enough, she took a knife to the coop. First she went to Gretel and said, ""Girl, stick out your little finger, but Gretel thought, ""No way,"" and held out her apron string. Grule cut into it a little, and said, ""Skinny, skinny."" Then she went to Hans and said, ""Boy, stick out your little finger,"" and Hans held out his trouser string. She likewise cut into it and said, ""Skinny, skinny,"" then went away. After this she thought, ""What should I give the children to eat to make them fat? Good things don't make them fat. I'll try something else."" And from then on she gave them nothing but flour porridge, which the children soon grew to hate. Some time later the witch again came to the coop with a knife and said to Gretel, ""Girl, stick out your little finger,"" and this time Gretel held out her finger. Old Grule cut into it a little, and a drop of blood appeared. Then the witch said, ""Fat, fat."" Then she went to Hans and told him to hold out his finger as well, which he did, just as Gretel had done. She cut into it too, and when it bled a little, she again said, ""Fat, fat."" She went to her kitchen and made a fire in her oven. After it had burned down she took a wooden crook and with it spread the coals evenly across the oven's entire surface. After a while she took a wet straw whisk and swept the coals to the front of the oven, then took them out. Then she went to the coop, opened it, and said, ""Come, children, I have some baked plums in the oven. You can get them out for me."" The two ran for joy into the kitchen with Old Grule, thinking that at last they were going to get something other than the eternal flour porridge. Arriving there, the witch got a baker's peel and told the children to sit on it, so she could push them into the oven. But while Grule was gone, Gretel looked into the oven and saw that there were no plums in it at all. So when Old Grule told her to sit on the peel first, she pretended to be so awkward that she fell off. Then she said, ""My dear Grule, I don't understand how I am supposed to sit on it. Show me, so I can see how."" Then Old Grule pulled her skirts together, sat down on the baker's peel, and said, ""See. This is how to do it."" And while she was thus sitting there, Gretel gave a sign to Hans, and bang, the children pushed the witch into the oven, and Old Grule burned up miserably. Gretel and Hans returned home. Their parents were very happy to see them, for they thought their children had died, but still each of them was given a beating for being disobedient.",Moravia,"Source: Marie Kosch, ""Von der alten Grule,"" Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Mähren (Kremsier: Druck und Commissionsverlag Heinrich Gusek, 1899), pp. 92-95.",NA,Translated by D.

327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,The Little Boy and the Wicked tepmother,"Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had a wife and two children, a boy and a girl. He was so poor that he possessed nothing in the world but the ashes on his hearth. His wife died, and after a time he married another woman, who was cantankerous and bad natured, and from morning till evening, as long as the day lasted, she gave the poor man no peace, but snarled and shouted at him. The woman said to him, ""Do away with these children. You cannot even keep me. How then can you keep all these mouths?"" for was she not a stepmother? The poor man stood her nagging for a long time, but then, one night, she quarreled so much that he promised her that he would take the children into the forest and leave them there. The two children were sitting in the corner but held their peace and heard all that was going on. The next day, the man, taking his ax upon his shoulder, called to the children and said to them, ""Come with me into the forest. I am going to cut wood."" The little children went with him, but before they left, the little girl filled her pocket with ashes from the hearth, and as she walked along she dropped little bits of coal the way they went. After a time they reached a very dense part of the forest, where they could not see their way any longer, and there the man said to the children, ""Wait here for a while. I am only going to cut wood yonder. When I have done I will come back and fetch you home."" And leaving the children there in the thicket, he went away, heavy hearted, and returned home. The children waited for a while, and seeing that their father did not return, the girl knew what he had done. So they slept through the night in the forest, and the next morning, taking her brother by the hand, she followed the trace of the ashes which she had left on the road, and thus came home to their own house. When the stepmother saw them, she did not know what to do with herself. She went almost out of her mind with fury. If she could, she would have swallowed them in a spoonful of water, so furious was she. The husband, who was a weakling, tried to pacify her, and to endeavor to get the children away by one means or another, but did not succeed. When the stepmother found that she could not do anything through her husband, she made up her mind that she herself would get rid of them. So one morning, when her husband had gone away, she took the little boy, and without saying anything to anybody, she killed him and gave him to his sister to cut him up, and prepare a meal for all of them. What was she to do? If she was not to be killed like her brother, she had to do what her stepmother told her. And so she cut him up and cooked him ready for the meal But she took the heart, and hid it away in a hollow of a tree. When the stepmother asked her where the heart was, she said that a dog had come and taken it away. In the evening, when the husband came home, she brought the broth with the meat for the husband to eat, and she sat down and ate of it, and so did the husband, not knowing that he was eating the flesh of his child. The little girl refused to eat it. She would not touch it. After they had finished, she gathered up all the little bones and hid them in the hollow of the tree where she had put the heart. The next morning, out of that hollow of the tree there came a little bird with dark feathers, and sitting on the branch of a tree, began to sing, ""Cuckoo!

327 folktales about 
abandoned children",0327,The Witch,"All day she thought of nothing but how she should get rid of them; and at last an evil idea came into her head, and she determined to send them out into the great gloomy wood where a wicked witch lived. And so one morning she spoke to them, saying: ""You have been such good children that I am going to send you to visit my granny, who lives in a dear little hut in the wood. You will have to wait upon her and serve her, but you will be well rewarded, for she will give you the best of everything."" So the children left the house together; and the little sister, who was very wise for her years, said to the brother: ""We will first go and see our own dear grandmother, and tell her where our stepmother is sending us."" And when the grandmother heard where they were going, she cried and said: ""You poor motherless children! How I pity you; and yet I can do nothing to help you! Your stepmother is not sending you to her granny, but to a wicked witch who lives in that great gloomy wood. Now listen to me, children. You must be civil and kind to everyone, and never say a cross word to anyone, and never touch a crumb belonging to anyone else. Who knows if, after all, help may not be sent to you?"" And she gave her grandchildren a bottle of milk and a piece of ham and a loaf of bread, and they set out for the great gloomy wood. When they reached it they saw in front of them, in the thickest of the trees, a queer little hut, and when they looked into it, there lay the witch, with her head on the threshold of the door, with one foot in one corner and the other in the other corner, and her knees cocked up, almost touching the ceiling. ""Who's there?"" she snarled, in an awful voice, when she saw the children. And they answered civilly, though they were so terrified that they hid behind one another, and said: ""Good morning, granny; our stepmother has sent us to wait upon you, and serve you."" ""See that you do it well, then,"" growled the witch. ""If I am pleased with you, I'll reward you; but if I am not, I'll put you in a pan and fry you in the oven -- that's what I'll do with you, my pretty dears! You have been gently reared, but you'll find my work hard enough. See if you don't."" And, so saying, she set the girl down to spin yarn, and she gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well, and she herself went out into the wood. Now, as the girl was sitting at her distaff, weeping bitterly because she could not spin, she heard the sound of hundreds of little feet, and from every hole and corner in the hut mice came pattering along the floor, squeaking and saying: So the girl set out to look for the cat, and, as she was hunting about, she met her brother, in great trouble because he could not carry water from the well in a sieve, as it came pouring out as fast as he put it in. And as she was trying to comfort him they heard a rustling of wings, and a flight of wrens alighted on the ground beside them. And the wrens said: When they entered the hut the cat was curled up on the floor. So they stroked her, and fed her with ham, and said to her: ""Pussy, grey pussy, tell us how we are to get away from the witch?"" Then the cat thanked them for the ham, and gave them a pocket handkerchief and a comb, and told them that when the witch pursued them, as she certainly would, all they had to do was to throw the handkerchief on the ground and run as fast as they could. As soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep, broad river would spring up, which would hinder the witch's progress. If she managed to get across it, they must throw the comb behind them and run for their lives, for where the comb fell a dense forest would start up, which would delay the witch so long that they would be able to get safely away. The cat had scarcely finished speaking when the witch returned to see if the children had fulfilled their tasks. ""Well, you have done well enough for today,"" she grumbled; ""but tomorrow you'll have something more difficult to do, and if you don't do it well, you pampered brats, straight into the oven you go."" Half dead with fright, and trembling in every limb, the poor children lay down to sleep on a heap of straw in the corner of the hut; but they dared not close their eyes, and scarcely ventured to breathe. In the morning the witch gave the girl two pieces of linen to weave before night, and the boy a pile of wood to cut into chips. Then the witch left them to their tasks, and went out into the wood. As soon as she had gone out of sight the children took the comb and the handkerchief, and, taking one another by the hand, they started and ran, and ran, and ran. And first they met the watchdog, who was going to leap on them and tear them to pieces; but they threw the remains of their bread to him, and he ate them and wagged his tail. Then they were hindered by the birch trees, whose branches almost put their eyes out. But the little sister tied the twigs together with a piece of ribbon, and they got past safely, and, after running through the wood, came out on to the open fields. In the meantime in the hut the cat was busy weaving the linen and tangling the threads as it wove. And the witch returned to see how the children were getting on; and she crept up to the window, and whispered: ""Are you weaving, my little dear?"" ""Yes, granny, I am weaving,"" answered the cat. When the witch saw that the children had escaped her, she was furious, and, hitting the cat with a porringer, she said: ""Why did you let the children leave the hut? Why did you not scratch their eyes out?"" But the cat curled up its tail and put its back up, and answered: ""I have served you all these years and you never even threw me a bone, but the dear children gave me their own piece of ham."" Then the witch was furious with the watchdog and with the birch trees, because they had let the children pass. But the dog answered: ""I have served you all these years and you never gave me so much as a hard crust, but the dear children gave me their own loaf of bread."" And the birch rustled its leaves, and said: ""I have served you longer than I can say, and you never tied a bit of twine even round my branches; and the dear children bound them up with their brightest ribbons."" So the witch saw there was no help to be got from her old servants, and that the best thing she could do was to mount on her broom and set off in pursuit of the children. And as the children ran they heard the sound of the broom sweeping the ground close behind them, so instantly they threw the handkerchief down over their shoulder, and in a moment a deep, broad river flowed behind them. When the witch came up to it, it took her a long time before she found a place which she could ford over on her broomstick; but at last she got across, and continued the chase faster than before. And as the children ran they heard a sound, and the little sister put her ear to the ground, and heard the broom sweeping the earth close behind them; so, quick as thought, she threw the comb down on the ground, and in an instant, as the cat had said, a dense forest sprung up, in which the roots and branches were so closely intertwined, that it was impossible to force a way through it. So when the witch came up to it on her broom she found that there was nothing for it but to turn round and go back to her hut. But the twins ran straight on till they reached their own home. Then they told their father all that they had suffered, and he was so angry with their stepmother that he drove her out of the house, and never let her return; but he and the children lived happily together; and he took care of them himself, and never let a stranger come near them.",Russia,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Yellow Fairy Book, new impression (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1906 [first published 1894]), pp. 216-21.","Type 313H*.

"Hello, House!",0066a,The Alligator and the Jackal,"And early the next morning he crawled as fast as he could to the jackal's den (which was a hole in the side of a hill) and crept into it, and hid himself, waiting for the jackal, who was out, to return home. But when the jackal got near the place he looked about him and thought, ""Dear me, the ground looks as if some heavy creature had been walking over it, and here are great clods of earth knocked down from each side of the door of my den, as if a very big animal had been trying to squeeze himself through it. I certainly will not go inside until I know that all is safe there."" So he called out, ""Little house, pretty house, my sweet little house, why do you not give an answer when I call? If I come, and all is safe and right, you always call out to me. Is anything wrong that you do not speak?"" Then the alligator, who was inside, thought, ""If that is the case I had better call out, that he may fancy all is right in his house."" And in as gentle a voice as he could, he said, ""Sweet little jackal."" At hearing these words the jackal felt quite frightened, and thought to himself, ""So the dreadful old alligator is there. I must try to kill him if I can, for if I do not he will certainly catch and kill me some day."" He therefore answered, ""Thank you, my dear little house. I like to hear your pretty voice. I am coming in in a minute, but first I must collect firewood to cook my dinner."" And he ran as fast as he could, and dragged all the dry branches and bits of stick he could find, close up to the mouth of the den. Meantime the alligator inside kept as quiet as a mouse, but he could not help laughing a little to himself, as he thought, ""So I have deceived this tiresome little jackal at last. In a few minutes he will run in here, and then won't I snap him up."" When the jackal had gathered together all the sticks he could find, and put them round the mouth of his den, he set them on fire and pushed them as far into it as possible. There was such a quantity of them that they soon blazed up into a great fire, and the smoke and flames filled the den and smothered the wicked old alligator, and burnt him to death, while the little jackal ran up and down: outside, dancing for joy and singing: ""How do you like my house, my friend?

The Himphamp,0571b,Jack Horner and the Innkeeper's Wife,"This man he had a handsome wife, Sweet fair and youthful too, A Quaker lov'd her as his life, An this Jack Horner knew. This Quaker was a 'Squire born, Who did in wealth abound, Thought Jack I'll catch him in the corn, Then put him in the pound. First to the inn-keeper I'll go, And whe I do him find, He soon shall understand and know, I will be truly kind: He met me in a narrow lane, And said, My Friend, good-morrow, The Inn-keeper replied again, My heart is full of sorrow, Two hundred pounds I am in debt, Which I should pay next week, It makes me sigh, lament and fret Having the coin to seek. Quoth Jack if you'll be rul'd by me, I'll put you in a way, How you yourself from debt may free, And all that money pay. Nay, this is joyful news, he cry'd Thou art a friend indeed, Thy wit whall be my rule and guide, For never was more need. Go tell thy loving wife said he, Thy joy and heart's delight, That thou must ride mildes forty three, And shan't be home to night. Then mind the council which I give, And be no ways afraid, For why I tell you as I live, Your debts shall soon be paid. Mount your bay nag and take your cloak With your warm morning-gown, And lodge within a hollow oak, A mile out of the town: There may you sleep in sweet content All night and take your rest, And leave it to my management, Then Sir, a pleasant jest, Next morning you shall there behold, The like ne'er seen before, Which shall produce a sum of Gold, Nay likewise silver store: The Inn-keeper said, Honest John Since you this promise make, Believe me, as I am a man, I will thy council take. Unto his Wife in haste he went And told her he must go A journey, saying be content, For why it must be so. She seemingly began to weep, And with sad sighs reply'd, You know alas! I cannot sleep Without you by my side. Said he kind Wife, do not repine, Why should You sigh and grieve? I go out to a friend jof mine, Some money to receive. This said, with woman's fond deceit, She straitway ceas'd to mourn, And gave him twenty kisses sweet, Wishing his safe return. So soon as he was out of sight, She to the Quaker sent, And order'd him to come at night, That to their heart's content They might be merry sport and play, Her husband being from home, The Quaker said, by Yea and Nay, I sill not fail to come. A sucking pib and capon too, For him she did prepare, For why alas, full well she knew He lov'd such dainty fare. Now just about the close of day, They both to supper fall; Now Jack was there as well as they And walk'd about the hall. He did her fond behaviour note, She on her friend did lean; Jack having his inchanted coat, He was not to be seen. He perfectly did hear and see How they did toy and play, Thought he I will revenged be Before the morning day. Her servant-maid she sent to bed When it grew somewhat late; This done, her Friend she likewise led Up to her chamber straight, Where he did soon strip off his cloaths, Stark-naked to his shirt, And into bed with her he goes, Concluding this not hurt. Jack in the chamber did abide 'Till it was almost day, Where coming to the curtains' side, He heard the Quaker say, That he had now a need to piss, And to the pot must go, Thought Jack I do rejoice at this, A pleasant joke I'll show. The Quaker thinking little harm, Unto the pot he came, While Jack having a cunning charm, He locks him to the same. The good wife often to him cries, Whe sits thou in the cold, Quoth he, I sticks between my thighs, I cannot loose my hold. Quoth she, What is the man a fool, And strait to he she got Then laid one hand upon his tool, And t'other on the pot. There did she tug and pull amain, In hopes to set him free, Yet all their labour prov'd in vain, She stuck as fast as he. They being both in sad distress, Strait for the maid did knock, Who never stood herself to dress, But came up in her smock: The sight she saw was a surprize, So see such noble swingers, She clapt her hands before her eyes, Yet peep'd between her fingers. You saucy slut, then said her dame, Come help us from the pot, The damsel said, I blush for shame To see what he has got: What has he got you saucy sow, Whey do you stand to prate? Come hither soon and help us now, Or 'faith I'll break your pate. Because her mistress should be pleas'd She strove to set them free, But strait the charm the damsel seiz'd, And there they stuck all three. It being now just break of day, And they all linked fast, Jack on his Pipe began to play, And down the stairs he pass'd. The Quaker, Mistress, and her Maid, When they the Pipe did hear, All caper'd to the tune he play'd, And eke their course did steer Into the street, where they advanc'd Naked, save smock and shirt, Like morris-dancers did they prance Up to the knees in dirt: They caper'd high, the piss did fly, Over their heads and ears, And then did run violently Like drops of brinish tears. The Quaker said, by Yea and Nay, We are bewitch'd all three, I hear a pair of bag-pipes play, Yet no one can I see. He brought them to the very oak Where the Inn-keeper lay, Jack for a while he never spoke, But on his pipe did play. The good Man in the hollow tree, Immediately peep'd out, His Neighbour, Wife, and Maid he see All dance and jump about. Who's hear, my kind and loving wife, Likewise my maid young Sue, My Quaking neighbour too ads'life, A jovial whoring crew. Jack broke the Charm, and then the pot Soon loosen'd from their hands, And they were made quite reeking hot With skipping o'er the lands. The Inn-keeper said, Note it well, I'll geld you e'er you go; The Quaker on his knees he fell, And cried some pity show. My precious nutmegs do not wound, For fear I should not live, I'll pay you down one hundred pounds If you will me forgive. No no, quoth Jack we will have two, In lawful ready gold, Or else we will not pardon you, We have you fast in hold. I'll freely give they they demand, But yet take care I pray, The wicked does not understand, That I have walk'd astray. No, no, he dry'd, and home they went, Where they the gold receive; The Inn-keeper is well content, He has no cause to grieve.

The Himphamp,0571b,Stupid Hans,"The landowner's added wealth swelled him with pride, although he owed it almost entirely to his faithful servant Hans, and he soon forgot his promise. At the conclusion of seven years he arranged for his daughter to marry a neighboring wealthy landowner. This breach of promise angered Hans greatly, but he said nothing, waiting instead for the wedding day when he would avenge himself. It happened that he had come into possession of a magic charm in the following manner: Once when he was hauling wood from the forest his wagon-shaft had broken. He fashioned a new one but was unable to attach it to the wagon. After numerous unsuccessful attempts he was about to give up when he heard a small voice behind him saying, ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" and the shaft immediately attached itself to the wagon. Hans looked about with amazement, but no one was to be seen. Afterward Hans experimented often with this magical charm, and he now planned to use it for his revenge. The wedding day arrived with a great celebration. The father of the bride spared no expense to make himself look important to his neighbors. In the evening the young couple slipped away from the festivities and retired to their bedroom. Hans followed them without being seen. The young bridegroom, suspecting nothing, embraced his blushing bride, when Hans softly spoke out, ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" The young couple could not separate themselves from his embrace. Hans retired quietly to his own bed in the stall. The parents did not discover the young couple's plight until the next morning. They cried out miserably, then sent Hans to the pastor, thinking that through prayer the pastor could cast out the devil who held the poor ones captive. It was a rainy day, and Hans was walking behind the pastor, who lifted his robe whenever he had to wade through a puddle. At such a moment Hans whispered a mighty ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" and the pastor was unable to release his robe, but had to continue holding it high. At the house he said a number of prayers, but they did not help, so Hans was sent to fetch a cunning-woman. Their way back led them through a broad ditch filled with water. When the cunning-woman approached it she lifted up her skirts in order to walk across. Hans murmured softly, ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" and the cunning-woman was forced to continue on her way while holding her skirts high. The news of the young couple's enchantment brought many neighbors to the scene, and everyone felt sorry for them. When the cunning-woman, weirdly holding up her skirts, approached the wedding house, a brash peasant touched her naked thigh with his tobacco pipe. Hans quickly said, ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" and the peasant had to follow her. When the bride's father saw that Hans was laughing mockingly while everyone else was sadly standing by, he cried out, ""This evil was caused by no one other than Hans. It is his revenge. Come, let's beat the daylight out of him!"" All hands immediately grabbed him and threw him over a bundle of straw, but when they raised their sticks Hans shouted, ""Hold fast, hold fast!"" and not a one of them could move an arm. Recognizing the power of his magic charm, they begged Hans to free them. They promised him a rich land holding and many other valuables. Hans made them swear to this and then called out, ""Let go, let go!"" Suddenly they were all free: the young couple, the pastor, the cunning woman, the brash peasant, and the angry neighbors. They all begged Hans never again to make use of the magic charm, which he promised. He received the property and the other valuables as agreed, and he died a wealthy and respected landowner.",Germany / Poland,"Source: Otto Knoop, Sagen und Erzauml;hlungen aus der Provinz Posen (Posen: Historische Gesellschaft für die Provinz Posen, 1893), pp. 202-204.",Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 until 1918.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Count and the Smith,"One day he said to him, ""On this hill you are to build me a castle, or I will have you torn to pieces."" When the man came home and told his wife what task had been given to him, the woman gave him a rope and said, ""Go into the woods and hang yourself, then you will be safe from the count's demands."" Seeing that he had no other choice, he took the rope and went into the woods. On the way he met a stranger who spoke to him, saying, ""I know what you plan to do, but instead, come with me."" He let him to a haystack and told him to lay down and go to sleep. The man did so. When he awoke, on the hill there was a castle surrounded by a deep moat. He quickly went to the count and showed him the castle. The count was very eager to get a closer look at the castle, and he walked up to it. However, as he was about to cross over the bridge, it collapsed, and he drowned. So the smith took possession of the castle, and he himself became a count.",Poland,"Source: Otto Knoop, ""Der Graf und der Schmied,"" Ostmärkische Sagen, Märchen und Erzählungen (Lissa im Posen: Oskar Eulitz' Verlag, 1909), no. 60, p. 117.",NA,NA
The Himphamp,0571b,The Himphamp,"The blacksmith saw that he was doomed, and in despair wandered into the woods. At last he came to an old woman who asked what was troubling him. He told her of the kings hardheartedness and asked for advise. Then the old woman taught him the magic that he would need to finish the castle. When the king saw the castle, he was amazed and angry, and now he commanded the blacksmith to dig a great moat around the new castle and to build four bridges over the moat, with a gate for each one, and all that within three days. The blacksmith, using the old woman's magic, completed this task in three days as well. The king was even more amazed and more angry, because now he did not know what kind of a difficult and impossible task he would be able to give the blacksmith in order to find an excuse to take his life. Finally the king, quite beside himself, declared, ""If you don't want to lose your life, you must make a himphamp for me in three days!"" The smith did not even know what a himphamp was, so more desperate than ever, he walked away. Once again he found the old woman, who said to him, ""Make a chamber pot of iron and place it under your bed. Then hide, and when you see anyone touch it, just say hold fast quietly to yourself, and you will soon see a himphamp!"" The blacksmith did what the old woman said. One evening the king came, as usual, to visit the blacksmiths wife, and the smith hid himself where he could watch. The lovers got undressed, and the wife got into bed. Before following her, the king had to use the pot. As soon as he touched the iron pot, the smith whispered, ""Hold fast,"" and the king, wearing only his nightshirt, stuck to the pot. The wife jumped out of bed and tried to tear the pot loose, but as soon as she touched it, the smith whispered ""hold fast,"" and she too became stuck. The king was enraged at this tomfoolery, and the smith's wife began to cry. Her maid heard the commotion and, half asleep and stark naked, came running to help them. But she too became stuck, just like the others. Then the smith stepped forward and drove all three from the house with an iron club. It was almost daytime, and the embarrassed maid picked up a bundle of hay and tried to cover her shame with it. A cow came by and wanted to get at the hay, but the smith said ""hold fast!"" and it also became attached. Then a bull came by and mounted the cow, and the smith called out once more, ""Hold fast!"" He drove them -- all stuck to the iron pot -- up one street and down another. The people were just beginning to stir, and they all laughed and jeered. A small boy looked out from his window and shouted, ""What a himphamp!"" The townspeople joined the smith, and together they drove the entire himphamp into the deep moat at the castle. Then they made the clever blacksmith their new king.",Scandinavia,NA,"Retold from Scandinavian sources, including: Sweden: Pher Arvid Säve, "" Hympä-Gympä,""Gotländska sagor, edited by Herbert Gustavson (Uppsala, 1955), vol. 1, no. 84, pp. 240-41.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Love of Ares and Aphrodite,"Now when Hephaestus heard the bitter tidings, he went his way to the forge, devising evil in the deep of his heart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and wrought fetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers might there unmovably remain. Now when he had forged the crafty net in his anger against Ares, he went on his way to the chamber where his marriage bed was set out, and strewed his snares all about the posts of the bed, and many too were hung aloft from the main beam, subtle as spiders' webs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed gods: so cunningly were they forged. Now after he had done winding the snare about the bed, he made as though he would go to Lemnos, that stablished castle, and this was far the dearest of all lands in his sight. But Ares of the golden rein kept no blind watch, what time he saw Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, depart afar. So he went on his way to the house of renowned Hephaestus, eager for the love of crowned Cytherea. Now she was but newly come from her sire, the mighty Cronion, and as it chanced had sat her down; and Ares entered the house, and clasped her hand, and spake, and hailed her: ""Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of love, for Hephaestus is no longer among his own people; methinks he is already gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men of savage speech."" So spake he, and a glad thing it seemed to her to lie with him. So they twain went to the couch, and laid them to sleep, and around them clung the cunning bonds of skilled Hephaestus, so that they could not move nor raise a limb. Then at the last they knew it, when there was no way to flee. Now the famous god of the strong arms drew near to them, having turned him back ere he reached the land of Lemnos. For Helios had kept watch, and told him all. So heavy at heart he went his way to his house, and stood at the entering in of the gate, and wild rage gat hold of him, and he cried terribly, and shouted to all the god: ""Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods, that live for ever, come hither, that ye may see a mirthful thing and a cruel, for that Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever dishonors me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of limb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there is none to blame but my father and mother, -- would they had never begotten me! But now shall ye see where these have gone up into my bed, and sleep together in love; and I am troubled at the sight. Yet, methinks, they will not care to lie thus even for a little while longer, despite their great love. Soon will they have no desire to sleep together, but the snare and the bond shall hold them, till her sire give back to me the gifts of wooing, one and all, those that I bestowed upon him for the hand of his shameless girl; for that his daughter is fair, but without discretion."" So spake he; and lo, the gods gathered together to the house of the brazen floor. Poseidon came, the girdler of the earth, and Hermes came, the bringer of luck, and prince Apollo came, the archer. But the lady goddesses abode each within her house for shame. So the gods, the givers of good things, stood in the porch: and laughter unquenchable arose among the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of cunning Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, looking to his neighbor: ""Ill deed, ill speed! The slow catcheth the swift! Lo, how Hephaestus, slow as he is, hath overtaken Ares, albeit he is the swiftest of the gods that hold Olympus, by his craft hath he taken him despite his lameness; wherefore surely Ares oweth the fine of the adulterer."" Thus they spake one to the other. But the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, spake to Hermes: ""Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger and giver of good things, wouldst thou be fain, aye, pressed by bonds though it might be, to lie on the couch by golden Aphrodite?"" Then the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: ""I would that this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about, and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet would I lie by golden Aphrodite."" So spake he, and laughter rose among the deathless gods. Howbeit Poseidon laughed not, but was instant with Hephaestus, the renowned artificer, to loose the bonds of Ares: and he uttered his voice, and spake to him winged words: ""Loose him, I pray thee, and I promise even as thou biddest me, that he shall himself pay all fair forfeit in the presence of the deathless gods."" Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: ""Require not this of me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth. Evil are evil folk's pledges to hold. How could I keep thee bound among the deathless gods, if Ares were to depart, avoiding the debt and the bond ?"" Then Poseidon answered him, shaker of the earth: ""Hephaestus, even if Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I myself will pay thee all."" Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: ""It may not be that I should say thee nay, neither is it meet."" Therewith the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds, and the twain, when they were freed from that strong bond, sprang up straightway, and departed, he to Thrace, but laughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of Cyprus, where is her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid upon the everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely raiment, a wonder to see. This was the song the famous minstrel sang.","Homer, The Odyssey","Source: The Odyssey of Homer, done into English Prose by S. H. Butcher and A. Lang; 3rd edition (New York: Macmillan and Company, 1888), pp. 123-26.","Hephaestrus [Vulcan] (the betrayed husband), a crippled smith.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Plaisham,"So he up and said to Nancy: ""What a pity it is for such a fine-looking woman as you to be bothered with that ould, complainin', good-for-nothing crony of a man that's as full of pains and aches as an egg's full of meat. If you were free of him the morrow, the finest and handsomest young man in the parish would be proud to have you for a wife."" At first Nancy used to laugh at this; but at last, when he kept on at it, it began to prey on Nancy's mind, and she said to young Rory one day: ""I don't believe a word of what you say. Who would take me if Shamus was buried the morra?"" ""Why,"" says Rory, ""you'd have the pick of the parish. I'd take you myself."" ""Is that true?"" says Nancy. ""I pledge you my word,"" says Rory, ""I would."" ""Oh, well, even if you would yourself,"" says Nancy, ""Shamus won't be buried tomorrow, or maybe, God help me, for ten years to come yet."" ""You've all that in your own hands,"" says Rory. ""How's that?"" says Nancy. ""Why, you can kill him off,"" says Rory. ""I wouldn't have the ould crature's blood on my head,"" says Nancy. ""Neither you need,"" says Rory. And then he sat down and began to tell Nancy how she could do away with Shamus and still not have his blood on her head. Now there was a prince called Connal, who lived in a wee sod house close by Nancy and Shamus, but whose fathers before him, ere their money was wasted, used to live in a grand castle. So, next day, over Nancy goes to this prince, and to him says: ""Why, Prince Connal, isn't it a shame to see the likes of you livin' in the likes of that house?"" ""I know it is,"" said he, ""but I cannot do any better."" ""Botheration,"" says Nancy, ""you easily can."" ""I wish you would tell me how,"" says Prince Connal. ""Why,"" says Nancy, ""there's my Shamus has little or nothing to do, an' why don't you make him build you a castle?"" ""Ah,"" says the prince, laughing, ""sure, Shamus couldn't build me a castle."" Says Nancy: ""You don't know Shamus, for there's not a thing in the wide world he couldn't do if he likes to; but he's that lazy, that if you don't break every bone in his body to make him do it, he won't do it."" ""Is that so?"" says Prince Connal. ""That's so,"" says Nancy. ""So if you order Shamus to build you a castle an' have it up in three week, or that you'll take his life if he doesn't, you'll soon have a grand castle to live in,"" says she. ""Well, if that's so,"" says Prince Connal, ""I'll not be long wanting a castle."" So on the very next morning, over he steps to Shamus's, calls Shamus out, and takes him with him to the place he had marked out for the site of his castle, and shows it to Shamus, and tells him he wants him to have a grand castle built and finished on that spot in three weeks' time. ""But,"" says Shamus, says he, ""I never built a castle in my life. I know nothing about it, an' I couldn't have you a castle there in thirty-three years, let alone three weeks."" ""O!"" says the prince, says he, ""I'm toul' there's no man in Ireland can build a castle better nor faster than you, if you only like to; and if you haven't that castle built on that ground in three weeks,"" says he, ""I'll have your life. So now choose for yourself."" And he walked away, and left Shamus standing there. When Shamus heard this, he was a down-hearted man, for he knew that Prince Connal was a man of his word and would not stop at taking any man's life any more than he would from putting the breath out of a beetle. So down he sits and begins to cry; and while Shamus was crying there, up to him comes a Wee Red Man, and says to Shamus: ""What are you crying about?"" ""Ah, my poor man,"" says Shamus, says he, ""don't be asking me, for there's no use in telling you, you could do nothing to help me."" ""You don't know that,"" says the Wee Red Man, says he. ""It's no harm to tell me anyhow."" So Shamus, to relieve his mind, ups and tells the Wee Red Man what Prince Connal had threatened to do to him if he had not a grand castle finished on that spot in three weeks. Says the little man, says he: ""Go to the Fairies' Glen at moonrise the night, and under the rockin' stone at the head of the glen you'll find a white rod. Take that rod with you, and mark out the plan of the castle on this ground with it; then go back and leave the rod where you got it, and by the time you get back again your castle will be finished."" At moonrise that night Shamus, as you may be well assured, was at the rockin' stone at the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and from under it he got a little white rod. He went to the hill where the Prince's castle was to be built, and with the point of the rod he marked out the plan of the castle, and then he went back and left the rod where he got it. The next morning, when Prince Connal got up out of bed and went out of his little sod hut to take the air, his eyes were opened, I tell you, to see the magnificent castle that was standing finished and with the coping-stones on it on the hill above. He lost no time till he went over to thank Shamus for building him such a beautiful castle; and when Nancy heard that the castle was finished, it was she that was the angry woman. She went out and looked at the castle, and she wondered and wondered, too, but she said nothing. She had a long chat with Rory that day again, and from Rory she went off to Prince Connal, and says she: ""Now, didn't I tell you right well what Shamus could do?"" ""I see you did,"" says Prince Connal, ""and it is very thankful to you I am. I'm contented now for life,"" says he, ""and I'll never forget yourself and Shamus."" ""Contented!"" says she; ""why, that place isn't half finished yet."" ""How's that?"" says Prince Connal. ""Why,"" says she, ""you need a beautiful river flowing past that castle, with lovely trees, and birds singing in the branches, and you should have the ocean roaring up beside it."" ""But still,"" says Prince Connal, says he, ""one can't have everything. This is a hundred miles from a river and a hundred miles from an ocean, and no trees ever grew on this hill, nor ever could grow on it, and no bird ever sang on it for the last three hundred years."" ""Then all the more reason,"" says she, ""why you should have all them things."" ""But I can't have them,"" says Prince Connal. ""Can't you?"" says she. ""Yes, you can. If you promise to have Shamus's life unless he has you all those things by your castle in three days, you'll soon have all you want,"" says Nancy. ""Well, well, that's wonderful,"" says Prince Connal, says he, ""and I'll do it."" So he sets out, and goes to Shamus's house, and calls Shamus out to him to tell him that his castle was very bare-looking without something about it. Says he: ""Shamus, I want you to put a beautiful river flowing past it, with plenty of trees and bushes along the banks, and also birds singing in them; and I want you to have the ocean roaring up by it also."" ""But, Prince Connal,"" says Shamus, says he, ""you know very well that I couldn't get you them things."" ""Right well I know you can,"" says Prince Connal, ""and I'll give you three days to have all them things done; and if you haven't them done at the end of three days, then I'll have your life"" And away goes Prince Connal. Poor Shamus, he sat down and began to cry at this, because he knew that he could not do one of these things. And as he was crying and crying he heard a voice in his ear, and looking up he saw the Wee Red Man. ""Shamus, Shamus,"" says he, ""what's the matter with you?"" ""O,"" says Shamus, says he, ""there's no use in telling you what's the matter with me this time. Although you helped me before, there's not a man in all the world could do what I've got to do now."" ""Well, anyhow,"" says the Wee Red Man, ""if I can't do you any good, I'll do you no harm."" So Shamus, to relieve his mind, ups and tells the Wee Red Man what's the matter with him. ""Shamus,"" says the Wee Red Man, says he, ""I'll tell you what you'll do. When the moon's rising tonight, be at the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and at the spring well there you'll find a cup and a leaf and a feather. Take the leaf and the feather with you, and a cup of water, and go back to the castle. Throw the water from you as far as you can throw it, and then blow the leaf off your right hand, and the feather off your left hand, and see what you'll see."" Shamus promised to do this. And when the moon rose that night, Shamus was at the spring well of the Glen of the Fairies, and he found there a cup, a leaf, and a feather. He lifted a cup of water and took it with him, and the leaf and the feather, and started for the castle. When he came there, he pitched the cup of water from him as far as he could pitch it, and at once the ocean, that was a hundred miles away, came roaring up beside the castle, and a beautiful river that had been flowing a hundred miles on the other side of the castle came flowing down past it into the ocean. Then he blew the leaf off his right hand, and all sorts of lovely trees and bushes sprang up along the river banks. Then he blew the feather off his left hand, and the trees and the bushes were filled with all sorts and varieties of lovely singing birds, that made the most beautiful music he ever had heard. And maybe that was not a surprise to Prince Connal when he got up in the morning and went out. Off he tramped to Shamus's to thank Shamus and Nancy, and when Nancy heard this she was the angry woman. That day she had another long confab with Rory, and from him she went off again to Prince Connal, and asked him how he liked his castle and all its surroundings. He said he was a pleased and proud man, that he was thankful to her and her man, Shamus, and that he would never forget it to them the longest day of his life. ""O, but,"" says she, ""you're not content. This night you'll have a great gathering of princes and lords and gentlemen feasting in your castle, and you'll surely want something to amuse them with. You must get a plaisham."" ""What's a plaisham?"" said Prince Connal. ""O,"" says Nancy, ""it's the most wonderful and most amusing thing in the world; it will keep your guests in good humor for nine days and nine nights after they have seen it."" ""Well,"" says Prince Connal, ""that must be a fine thing entirely, and I'm sure I would be might anxious to have it. But,"" says he, ""where would I get it or how would I get it?"" ""Well,"" says Nancy, ""that's easy. If you order Shamus to bring a plaisham to your castle by supper time this night, and promise to have his life if he hasn't it there, he'll soon get it for you."" ""Well, if that's so,"" says Prince Connal, ""I'll not be long wanting a plaisham."" So home went Nancy rejoicing this time, for she said to herself that poor old Shamus would not be long living now, because there was no such thing known in the whole wide world as a plaisham; and though Shamus might build castles, and bring oceans and rivers and trees and birds to them, all in one night, he could not get a thing that did not exist and was only invented by Rory. Well, off to Shamus went Prince Connal without much loss of time, and called Shamus out of his little cabin. He told him he was heartily well pleased with all he had done for him. ""But there's one thing more I want you to do, Shamus, and then I'll be content,"" says he. ""This night I give a grand supper to the lords, ladies, and gentry of the country, and I want something to amuse them with; so at supper time you must bring me a plaisham."" ""A plaisham! What's that?"" says Shamus. ""I don't know,"" says Prince Connal. ""No more do I,"" says Shamus, ""an' how do you expect me to fetch it to you then?"" ""Well,"" says Prince Connal, says he, ""this is all there is to be said about it -- if you haven't a plaisham at my castle door at supper time the night, you'll be a dead man."" ""O, O,"" says Shamus, says he, and sat down on the ditch and began to cry, while Prince Connal went off home. ""Shamus, Shamus,"" says a voice in his ears, ""what are you cryin' about now?"" Poor Shamus lifted his head and looked around, and there beside him stood the Wee Red Man. ""O!"" says Shamus, says he, ""don't mind asking me,"" he says, ""for it's no use in telling you what's the matter with me now. You may build a castle for me"" says he, ""and you may bring oceans and rivers to it, and trees and birds; but you couldn't do anything to help me now."" ""How do you know that?"" said the Wee Red Man. ""Oh, I know it well,"" says Shamus, says he, ""you couldn't give me the thing that never was an' never will be!"" ""Well,"" says the Wee Red Man, says he, ""tell me what it is anyhow. If I can't do you any good, sure I can't do you any harm."" So, to relieve his mind, Shamus ups and tells him that Prince Connal had ordered him, within twenty-four hours, to have at his castle door a plaisham. ""But,"" says Shamus, says he, ""there never was such a thing as that."" ""Sure enough,"" says the Wee Red Man, ""there never was. But still, if Prince Connal wants it, we must try to get it for him. This night, Shamus,"" says the Wee Red Man, says he, ""go to the head of the Glen of the Fairies, to the sciog bush [Fairy thorn], where you'll find a bone ring hanging on a branch of the thorn. Take it with you back home. When you get home, young Rory will be chatting with your wife in the kitchen. Don't you go in there, but go into the byre [cowshed], and put the ring in the cow's nose; then lie quiet, and you'll soon have a plaisham to drive to Prince Connal's castle door."" Shamus thanked the Wee Red Man, and that night he went to the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and sure enough, he found the ring hanging from one of the branches of the sciog bush. He took it with him, and started for home. When he looked in through the kitchen window, there he saw Nancy and Rory sitting over the fire, chatting and confabbing about how they would get rid of him; but he said nothing, only went into the byre. He put the ring into the brannet cow's nose, and as soon as the ring went into it, the cow began to kick and rear and create a great tenherary of a noise entirely. Then Shamus got in under some hay in the corner. It was no time at all until Nancy was out to find what was wrong with the brannet cow. She struck the cow with her fist to quiet her, but when she hit her, her fist stuck to the cow, and she could not get away. Rory had come running out after Nancy to help her, and Nancy called: ""Rory, Rory, pull me away from the cow."" Rory got hold of her to pull her away, but as he did so his hands stuck to Nancy, and he could not get away himself. Up then jumped Shamus from under the hay in the corner. ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" And out of the byre starts the cow with Nancy stuck to her, and Rory stuck to that, and heads toward the castle, with the cow rearing and rowting, and Nancy and Rory yelling and bawling. They made a terrible din entirely, and roused the whole countryside, who flocked out to see what was the matter. Down past Rory's house the cow went, and Rory's mother, seeing him sticking to Nancy, ran out to pull him away; but when she laid her hand on Rory, she stuck to him; and ""Hup, Hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" So on they went. And Rory's father ran after them to pull the mother away; but when he laid his hand on the mother, he stuck to her; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, ""drive on the plaisham."" On again they went, and next they passed where a man was cleaning out his byre. When the man saw the ridiculous string of them, he flung a graip [fork] and a graipful of manure at them, and it stuck to Rory's father; and ""Hup, Hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" But the man ran after to save his graip, and when he god hold of the graip, he stuck to it; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" On they went; and a tailor came flying out of his house with his lap-board in his hand. He struck the string of them with the lap-board, the lap-board stuck to the last man, and the tailor stuck to it; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" Then they passed a cobbler's. He ran out with his heel-stick, and struck the tailor; but the heel-stick stuck to the tailor, and the cobbler stuck to the heel-stick; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" Then on they went, and they next passed a blacksmith's forge. The blacksmith ran out, and struck the cobbler with his sledge. The sledge stuck to the cobbler, and the blacksmith stuck to the sledge; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" When they came near the castle, they passed a great gentleman's house entirely, and the gentleman came running out, and got hold of the blacksmith to pull him away; but the gentleman stuck to the blacksmith, and could not get away himself; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" The gentleman's wife, seeing him stuck, ran after her man to pull him away; but the wife stuck to the gentleman; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" Then their children ran after them to pull the mother away, and they stuck to the mother; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" Then the butler ran to get hold of the children, and he stuck to them; and the footman ran to get hold of the butler, and tuck to him; and the cook ran to get hold of the footman, and stuck to him; and the servants all ran to get hold of the cook, and they stuck to her; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" And on they went; and when they came up to the castle, the plaisham was a mile long, and the yelling and bawling and noise that they made could be heard anywhere within the four seas of Ireland. The racket was so terrible that Prince Connal and all his guests and all his servants and all in his house came running to the windows to see what was the matter, at all, at all; and when Prince Connal saw what was coming to his house, and heard the racket they were raising, he yelled to his Prime Minister to go and drive them off with a whip. The Prime Minister ran meeting them, and took the whip to them; but the whip stuck to them, and he stuck to the whip; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" Then Prince Connal ordered out all his other ministers and all of his servants to head it off and turn it away from his castle; but every one of the servants that got hold of it stuck to it; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" And the plaisham moved on still for the castle. Then Prince Connal himself, with all his guests, ran out to turn it away; but when Prince Connal laid hands on the plaisham, he stuck to it; and when his guests laid hand on him, they stuck one by one to him; and ""Hup, hup!"" says Shamus, says he, ""drive on the plaisham."" And with all the racket and all the noise of the ranting, roaring, rearing, and rawting, in through the castle hall-door drove the plaisham, through and through and out at the other side. The castle itself fell down and disappeared, the bone ring rolled away from the cow's nose, and the plaisham all at once broke up, and when Prince Connal looked around, there was no castle at all, only the sod hut, and he went into it a sorry man. And all the others slunk off home, right heartily ashamed of themselves, for the whole world was laughing at them. Nancy, she went east; and Rory, he went west; and neither one of them was ever heard of more. As for Shamus, he went home to his own little cabin, and lived all alone, happy and contented, for the rest of his life, and may you and I do the same.",Ireland,"Source: Seumas MacManus, Donegal Fairy Stories (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, and Company, 1915), pp. 1-28.",Link to this tale contained in a single file: The Plaisham.,NA
The Himphamp,0571b,The Raja's Son and the Kotwal's Son,"One day, the kotwal's son said to the prince, ""Come, Brother Prince, let us go and visit our fathers-in-law."" The other replied, ""Most willingly."" Then the kotwal's son said again, ''Let us both go to the house of each of our fathers-in-law, and introduce one another."" ""Very well,"" replied the prince. ""Let us start at once, then,"" said the kotwal's son, ""and, first, let us go to my father-in-law's."" ""Certainly, there's no harm in that,"" answered the prince. Forthwith they took leave of their parents, and started to pay their visits. As agreed, they went first to the house of the father-in-law of the kotwal's son. When they arrived there, the kotwal's son went straight into the house, while the prince stood waiting outside. His father-in-law was overjoyed at seeing the kotwal's son, and welcomed him most heartily. Then the young man said to the people of the house, ""Outside there I have a servant; let some little attention be paid to him."" The prince was near enough to hear what he said. Thereupon he said, ""I'm rightly served for my folly in doing as I have done. However, I'll wait and see what more is fated to befall me."" Some time after, it happened that there was no grass for the kotwal's son's horse. When this was told him, the kotwal's son said: ""Put a sickle into the hands of that man of mine there, and let him cut some grass and fetch it to the horse."" The people of the house did as he said; a sickle was put into the prince's hands, and he was bidden go and cut grass. The prince took the sickle, thinking, ""What am I to do now?"" But he could not help himself, so he set off to cut the grass. He had not been long at work before he cut his finger so badly that it streamed with blood. The prince began to weep bitterly. Just at this moment, Bhagavati and Siva happened to pass along that road. Bhagavati said, ""Thakur, let us see who that is that's weeping there."" Mahadeva answered, ""This is always the way with you. You can't walk along a road without asking questions without end. Who is weeping? Why is he weeping? and so forth -- all such things have continually to be explained to you. Come on, never mind that just now."" ""No, no,"" said Bhagavati, ""you must tell me."" What could Mahadeva do? There was nothing for it but to tell her the whole story. Then she said, ""Let us go to the prince."" ""Very well,"" answered Mahadeva, ""come along."" With these words, they both walked up to the prince, and Bhagavati asked him, ""Who are you?"" The prince at once told her all about himself. Thcn the goddess said, ""Don't be afraid. Touch with your hand the finger that has been cut and say: Many days passed, and still the toils and sufferings of the prince were as great and painful as ever. Accordingly, he said to himself one day, ""I'll teach these people a lesson."" The night following, when the kotwal's son and his wife went to their own room, he took his stand in a secret place so as to be able to watch them. The kotwal's son took up his hookah, and was just beginning to smoke. At that very moment, the prince said: At length the master of the house said, ""Let somebody go and tell the family priest what has happened."" But almost everyone but the prince was fastened to the hookah; so he had to be sent with the message. He was not long in reaching the priest, and told him that the master of the house wished him to come as quick as ever he could. The priest started up in a great hurry. His wife said, ""I will come too."" ""How in the world can you come at this time of night?"" he answered. But she said, ""I'm sure that some merriment must be going on at the master's house. That's why you have been sent for; so I'll not stay here alone, let me tell you."" In this way, his wife kept urging the priest for leave to accompany him, until, at length, he said, ""Well, come along, then."" They dismissed the messenger, and, forthwith, started, themselves. It chanced that, at one place, a little stream flowed across the road. When they came to this stream, the priest's wife said to him, ""At this time of night, it's quite impossible for me to cross on foot."" Now the prince had waited for them there, and was sitting by the side of the stream. Hearing the woman speak, he said to the priest, ""Venerable sir, take up my venerable mother on your shoulders and so carry her over. The water here is very shallow."" ""That is a very good idea,"" said the priest's wife to her husband. ""I'll get upon your back, and you'll take me across to the other side and set me down there."" What could the poor Brahman do? Seeing no help for it, he took his wife upon his back, and waded with her through the stream to the other side. But, while he was doing so, before he had got across, the prince took care to repeat the spell again: Here was another terrible fix. At last the Brahman, with his wife on his back, had to trudge on to his master's house. When he arrived there, the people of the house, seeing the plight he was in, all began to laugh. They asked him, ""Venerable sir, why have you our venerable mother on your back?"" The Brahman answered angrily, ""How should I know? I never saw such a disobedient and unmanageable woman."" Then they said, ""Venerable mother, come down."" She answered, ""I can't come down."" Hearing this, they said, ""You're in the very same plight as ourselves. What was the good of our sending for you? The exorcist we sent for to drive out the devils, turns out to be possessed, himself. Where can we go for help now?"" Hereupon they all began to ask, ""Where is that servant?"" The priest said, ""It was he who came to call me."" Hearing this, the master of the house ordered him to be brought at once. He soon appeared, and the master said to him, ""Tell us what you know about this affair."" He answered, ""I'm only a servant, what should I know?"" But the master continued to urge and entreat him, till, at length, he said, ""It is by your own son-in-law's fault that all this has happened. This is what has come of his making me cut grass for his horse."" Then, taking pity upon them, the prince recited this charm:",India,"Source: William McCulloch, Bengali Household tales (London, New York, and Toronto: Hodder and Stoughton, 1919), , no. 22, pp. 212-17.",Siv (usually spelled Shiva) is one of the principal deities of Hinduism.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Smith and the Priest,"Thus one day the priest went to the nobleman and said, ""In your village there is a very talented smith who can make anything that he wants to. His skill is so great that within one night he could build a palace in your courtyard. However, you will have to threaten him with body and soul, otherwise he will refuse."" The nobleman summoned the smith and said, ""I have heard so much about your skill that I want to put it to the test. Build a palace for me in my courtyard, and it must be finished in one night."" ""Oh God,"" said the smith, ""that is not possible. I cannot do that."" ""I am telling you,"" cried the nobleman, ""if the palace is not finished by tomorrow morning I shall have you hanged without mercy."" The smith sadly returned home to his wife. ""Wife,"" he said, ""I am supposed to build a palace for the nobleman tonight, and if I do not succeed I am to die."" The wife said, ""The only thing that you can do is to go away this very evening."" ""Yes,"" he said, ""I'd sooner go away as far as my feet can carry me than to lose my life."" So he tied together a bundle, sadly took leave of his wife, and went on his way, thinking that he would never return. And that is just what his wife and the priest wanted. At nightfall the smith came into a forest where he was met by a gray man who greeted him and asked, ""Where to, my dear smith?"" ""Oh,"" said the smith, ""I was supposed to build a palace for the nobleman tonight. He commanded me to do this under the threat of death, and because I am unable to do so I am running away as far as my feet can carry me."" ""Just go back home,"" said the gray man. ""I shall take care of things for you. The palace will be finished tomorrow morning in due time."" So the smith returned home to his wife. She was just about to fetch the priest when she saw her husband approaching, and she cried out with surprise, ""Oh God, you have come back home. What will happen when the palace is not finished in the morning?"" ""Let happen what will happen,"" said the smith. ""I cannot stand being away from you and from home for so long."" With that he went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning the nobleman arose very early and looked out his window. He could scarcely believe his eyes, for a magnificent palace was standing there, glistening in the first rays of morning sunshine. When the priest learned what had happened and saw that his plan had failed, he went back to the nobleman and said, ""Now you know how skilled the smith is. This time tell him to bring a himphamp to the palace before tomorrow morning. You have to command him under the threat of body and soul, or he will not do it."" Then the nobleman summoned the smith to appear before him a second time, saying, ""You built the palace entirely to my satisfaction; now you must bring a himphamp to the palace by tomorrow morning. With your skill that should be an easy task for you."" ""My lord,"" said the smith, ""how can I bring you a himphamp when I don't even know what one is? I cannot do it."" ""That makes no difference,"" said the nobleman. ""If there is no himphamp before my palace tomorrow morning I shall have you hanged without mercy."" Then the smith sadly went back home to his wife. ""Oh God, wife,"" he said, ""now the nobleman wants me to get a himphamp by tomorrow morning, and if I cannot do so he will have me hanged without mercy."" The wife said, ""The only thing that you can do is to go away this very evening."" ""Yes,"" he said, ""I'd sooner go away as far as my feet can carry me than to lose my life."" So he tied together a bundle, sadly took leave of his wife, and went on his way, thinking that he would never return. That is just what his unfaithful wife and the priest wanted, and the smith had scarcely left when the priest sneaked into his house to be with the wife. Meanwhile the smith once again came into the woods and was again was met by the gray man, who asked, ""Where to, my dear smith?"" ""Oh,"" said the smith, ""now that the nobleman has the palace he also wants a himphamp, and because I cannot get one for him I am going as far as my feet can carry me."" ""No one other than the priest has put him up to this,"" said the gray man. ""He wants your wife and is trying to get you out of the way. Just go back home. The two of them are there together, and when you see the priest giving your wife a kiss, just say 'Hold fast!' Then take your whip and drive the two of them out of your house along the street to the nobleman's palace. Whenever anyone comes and tries to pull them apart, just say 'Hold fast!"" and they will all be stuck together until you say 'Let go!' That will turn into a wonderful himphamp."" The smith thanked the gray man and returned home. It was early morning when he arrived at his village, and he sneaked into his house just as the priest was giving his wife a kiss. ""Hold fast!"" cried the smith. Hearing the smith's voice, the priest tried to run away, but -- oh dear! -- it was as if he were glued to the woman. Then the smith took his whip from the wall and drove the two of them out of the house and along the street. They came to the priest's house just as his servant girl with her apron full of hay was about to feed the cow. Seeing her master in a bad situation she quickly ran up and took hold of him in order to get him into his own house, so that no one would see his shame. ""Hold fast!"" cried the smith, and the priest's servant girl stuck to the others and had to go along with them. At the same time a herder boy came by, playing his pipe and driving his herd along before him. An old cow wanted to eat the hay that the priest's servant girl was carrying in her apron. ""Hold fast!"" cried the smith, and the old cow also stuck to the others and had to go along with them. All this was seen by a baker who had just heated his oven and was about to rake out the coals. He quickly ran up and hit the cow with his long oven-rake. ""Hold fast!"" cried the smith, and the baker with his long oven-rake also stuck to the others and had to go along with them. That morning the nobleman got up early; he looked out the window into the courtyard just as the smith came up with his himphamp. When he saw it the nobleman began to laugh, and said, ""You have done well, my dear smith. That is a wonderful himphamp that you have brought to me, but turn them loose now, so they can go back home."" Then the smith said, ""Let go!"" and with that they all ran back where they had come from: the priest, the wife, the servant girl, the cow, and the baker with his long oven-rake. However, the priest was so shamed that he never again returned to the smith's house.",Germany,"Source: Wilhelm Busch, ""Der Schmied und der Pfaffe,"" Ut ôler Welt: Volksmärchen, Sagen, Volkslieder und Reime (Munich: Lothar Joachim Verlag, 1910), no. 29, pp. 74-76.",NA,Translated by D.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Story of the Himphamp,"The smith was normally a kind-hearted man, but did not like how the sexton was behaving, so one day he made it clear to him that he was not to come to eat at the smith's house any more often than he did so at the other villagers, warning him that if he showed up out of turn the smith would throw him out the door. ""Is that how you are going to treat me?"" said the sexton to himself. ""I'll show you!"" He then went straight to the manor house and told the nobleman why the latter should be getting more out of his people. For example, he said that there was a smith in the village who could do more than just eat bread. It would be easy for him in one night to thresh and clean all the grain in the nobleman's barn. The nobleman held the sexton to be an intelligent and experienced man, so he believed his malicious claim. He immediately sent for the smith, who had no choice but to appear before him. ""My dear craftsman,"" said the lord, ""I have learned that you are more skillful than others. Here is a threshing flail. If you haven't threshed and cleaned all the grain in my barn before sunrise tomorrow, I'll have you driven out of the village with shame and curses. Then just try to find another position somewhere else. The smith swore by heaven and earth that the nobleman had been wrongly informed, but nothing he could say was of any help. He was led into the barn, the threshing flail was handed to him, and the barn door was locked behind him. He stood there cursing his fate while the sexton was at the smith's house feasting on roasted chicken and drinking strong beer with the smith's young wife, laughing about his cunning until he almost burst. At nightfall a small gray man suddenly approached the smith and said, ""Why are you just standing here and not beginning your work? Climb up into the loft and throw the sheaves down to me. I'll help you."" The smith did what he was asked to. The little gray man struck each sheaf once with the flail, and the grain and the chaff flew into separate piles on the threshing floor. It all went so fast that the smith could not throw down the sheaves quickly enough. Then the little man helped to throw down the sheaves, and all so terribly fast that long before sunrise all the grain had been threshed and cleaned, just as the nobleman had ordered. Finally the little man produced a huge sack, filled it with the grain, then stood it in front of the manor house so that the lord would see it in the morning as soon as he got out of bed. At sunrise the sexton himself came to the manor house to be present when the smith was driven from the village. When he saw the huge sack filled with threshed grain he at first did not believe his eyes; but then he turned green and yellow with anger, got ahold of himself, wished the smith a good morning, and rushed to the nobleman's room. ""Now, honorable sir, you can see for yourself,"" said the malicious man, ""if the peasants in the village are doing enough for you. The smith did what you commanded him to do. Not a single kernel from the threshed grain is missing in the sack. How would it be if you were to give him an even more difficult task for the coming night? Have him carry away the large pile of stones that is in front of the manor house and replace it with a pond filled with the most beautiful goldfish."" This made the nobleman's mouth water, because the pile of stones had annoyed him for a long time, and he would love to have a goldfish pond in front of his house. Therefore he went out and praised the smith for having fulfilled the first task, but then ordered him during the following night to replace the pile of stones with a goldfish pond. If he did not do so he would be driven away with shame and curses. The sexton laughed quietly, because the smith would never be able to fulfill this task. Happily he went to the smith's house and let the young wife serve him a delicious meal. At the same time the smith himself was sadly hammering away at the stones with a sledgehammer, but however hard he tried he could not break off even a single chip. As it grew dark the little gray man appeared again and said, ""Smith, you are not getting anywhere! Stand aside, or a flying stone might hit you in the head!"" The smith had scarcely stepped back when the little man struck in the middle of the stones with the hammer, and they flew apart like the wind blows through a pile of chaff, and the smith was happy that he escaped injury. The gray man's blows also dug out a deep hole in the earth. Before long clouds descended over the hole. Alder and birch trees sprouted forth on the banks, as did all kinds of beautiful flowers. Before the smith knew what was happening the pond was finished, and the greatest miracle of all was that it was teeming with the most beautiful shimmering, glistening goldfish. ""Show that to his honorable lordship tomorrow morning,"" said the gray man, ""and ask him if he is satisfied."" With that he disappeared. The lord of the manor was indeed satisfied, and he openly praised the smith. The sexton looked on grimly, for his wicked proposals had come to nothing. But he put on a happy face, and with the most honest appearance in the world said to the nobleman, ""Yes, indeed, the smith did was he was supposed to do. But your lordship should require one more task from him. Have this skillful man forge a himphamp, without iron and steel, without fire and anvil, and -- of course -- in one night. That is the greatest masterpiece that the smith knows how to create. If he refuses to forge a himphamp, it is only because of his wickedness -- willfully denying your lordship the right to see such a masterpiece."" The sexton's speech made the nobleman curious, and he said to the smith, ""Your skill has brought me great pleasure. Now I want to know how you forge a himphamp without steel and iron and without fire and anvil."" ""Oh, your honor,"" cried the smith, ""I will do anything for you, but as long as I live I cannot possible forge a himphamp without steel and iron and without fire and anvil."" ""Silence!"" said the lord. ""If you can thresh all of my grain in one night and create a magnificent goldfish pond in place of a pile of stones, then you can also forge a himphamp for me without steel and iron, without fire and anvil. Get busy now. Tomorrow morning I want to see your work."" The poor man stood there not knowing what to do. At midnight the little gray man came to him and said, ""Idiot, a himphamp is the easiest thing to make. Go home and get your large bullwhip, then hide under your bed without letting your wife know that you are there. Keep your eyes and ears open. As soon as you see something that you don't like just call out 'Himp, hamp, stick together!' and you will soon have a himphamp without steel and iron, without fire and anvil. But don't forget to use your whip."" The smith promised the little gray man faithfully to follow his instructions. On tiptoes he sneaked into his house, took the large bullwhip down from its nail, then crept under the bed. Scarcely a quarter of an hour had passed when his wife set the table, loading it with a fine pork roast, white bread, and good strong beer. A little later the sexton came in, sat down next to the smith's wife, and began to feast. Then he put his arm around the young woman, drank to her health, and described with laughter the task that he tricked the nobleman into giving her husband. Finishing his story, he gave her a kiss. This was too much for the smith hiding under the bed, and he called out ""Himp, hamp, stick together!"" And behold, although the two of them, upon hearing the smith's voice, wanted more than anything else to jump out the window, they had to stay where they were. It was as though they had grown together. Then the smith stepped forth from his hiding place -- you saw that coming, didn't you -- and went after the godless couple with his bullwhip. They howled and cried and begged for forgiveness, but to no avail. The next morning, just at sunrise, he drove them out of the house toward the manor house. Underway they came to some oxen from the estate; these turned wild and wanted to gore them. ""Himp, hamp, stick together!"" cried the smith angrily, and the oxen stuck to the sexton and the woman, and they had to go along too. Finally, they came to two servants who were blocking their way with a load of hay. ""Himp, hamp, stick together!"" was again the cry, and they too had to go along toward the manor house. When they appeared before the nobleman the smith said, ""Look here, my lord, I have forged a himphamp for you, without steel and iron, without fire and anvil."" And with that he beat at the godless couple so fiercely that they both fell down dead. Now the nobleman know for sure why the sexton had praised the smith's abilities so highly.",Germany,"Source: Ulrich Jahn, ""Das Märchen vom Himphamp,"" Volksmärchen aus Pommern und Rügen, part 1 (Norden and Leipzig: Diedrich Soltau's Verlag, 1891), no. 44, pp. pp. 239-42.",NA,Translated by D.

The Himphamp,0571b,The Tale of the Basin,"Questioned by the pastor as to the conditions in their household, the husband admitted that a priest, known by the name Sir John, was often a guest in their home. ""I suspect that this Sir John may be up to no good,"" warned the pastor, then outlined a plan to his gullible brother to reveal the true purpose of the priest's visits. Accordingly, the husband took the chamber pot from his own bedroom to the pastor, who spoke a charm over it; and the pot was then returned to its normal place beside the married couple's bed. Announcing that he would be away for some time, the husband took leave of his wife. No sooner had he disappeared from view than the wife sent for Sir John and began to prepare a feast for the two of them. Then having eaten their fill, they retired to the bedroom. In the middle of the night the priest arose to make water and picked up the chamber pot with his two hands, but to his alarm he discovered that some mysterious power held him fast to the basin. ""Woman, help me!"" he cried to his bed partner. She jumped to his aid, but immediately found herself stuck to him and to the pot as well. Their combined cries awakened the servant girl who ran, stark-naked, to help her mistress, but she too stuck to the pot. What followed was quite a dance: The three of them spilled onto the street just at daybreak, and one after another different villagers tried to pull them apart, only to become stuck to the procession themselves. Finally they were approached by the husband and his brother the parson. The cuckolded husband demanded payment of one hundred pounds from Sir John, threatening to cut of the latter's ""equipment,"" unless he complied. Sir John, valuing his private parts, agreed to pay the proposed fine. Hearing these vows, the pastor spoke a charm over the basin, and its prisoners found themselves freed. The shamed priest left forthwith for a different country, and as for the husband and wife, from that time onward they lived together without strife.",England,"Source: The Tale of the Basin, edited by Melissa M.

The Himphamp,0571b,"Vulcan, Mars, and Venus","Immediately he files out some slender chains of brass, and nets, and meshes, which can escape the eye. The finest threads cannot surpass that work, nor yet the cobweb that hangs from the top of the beam. He makes it so, too, as to yield to a slight touch, and a gentle movement, and skillfully arranges it drawn around the bed. When the wife and the gallant come into the same bed, being both caught through the artifice of the husband, and chains prepared by this new contrivance, they are held fast in the very midst of their embraces. The Lemnian God immediately threw open the folding doors of ivory, and admitted the Deities. There they lay disgracefully bound. And yet many a one of the Gods, not the serious ones, could fain wish thus to become disgraced. The Gods of heaven laughed, and for a long time was this the most noted story in all heaven. For little wotteth he of life Who thinks he only hath his wife), And then the gods did he convoke, Who crowded round with gibe and joke, Beholding how the pair were ta'en. But many 'mong the host, with pain, Beheld dame Venus' sore distress, While marveling at her loveliness; Nor heard unmoved her bitter cries At suffering such indignities Before her peers in open day. Yet 'twas no marvel, one would say, That Venus unto Mars should give men Herself -- for could she care to live With Vulcan, black from head to foot, Hands, face, and throat begrimed with soot? Such things in Venus' breast must rouse Disgust, though Vulcan were her spouse. Nay, even though she had been paired With Absalom the golden-haired, Or lovely Paris, Priam's son, She scarce had been content with one, For ever would that beauteous queen Do what all women love I ween. Women as free as men are born; It is the law alone hath torn Their charter, and that freedom riven From out their hands by Nature given. For Nature is not such a fool As order, by unbending rule, Margot to keep to Robichon, Nor yet for him the only one To be Marie or fair Perrette, Jane, Agnes, or sweet Mariette, But as, dear son, I scarce need teach, Made each for all and all for each, And every one for all alike, E'en as the taste and fancy strike. So that (although by marriage law They are assigned like things of straw), To satisfy Dame Nature's call, To which they hearken one and all, And strifes and murders to avoid, Whereto they well might be decoyed, Ever have women, foul or fair, Whether the name of maid they bear, Or wife, done all within their power To win back freedom as their dower; Though at great hazards they maintain Their rights, and evils thick as rain Have happed both now and formerly. Ten, nay, a hundred easily, Could I of instances set forth; But let them pass as nowise worth My pains to tell or yours to hear, You'd weary ere the end came near. ... Therefore, dear son, should we be slow Venus and Mars to blame, I trow. And though the Gods in mockery laughed To see the pair by Vulcan's craft Ensnared, yet many a one full fain Had been, could he the place have ta'en Of Mars, in Venus' fond embrace, While Vulcan, mad with his disgrace, Two thousand marks had rather given Than cuckold stand before high heaven. The pair he thus exposed to shame, Reckless of scorn henceforth became, And boldly practiced that which they Strove erst to hide from light of day, Shame and decorum cast aside. And then the Gods told far and wide The tale, till all through heaven 'twas known, From mouth to mouth mid laughter thrown. And Vulcan stormed with rage to think The draught he brewed he needs must drink, Since for his folly naught could he Find balsam, salve, or remedy. Rather than trap the twain, indeed, 'Twere wiser to have given no heed, But silently resolve in mind To be to Venus' failings blind, So long as she towards him behaved With kindness, granting all he craved. From this, let no man e'er forget That grievous folly 'tis to set A trap whereby a wife may be Convicted of inconstancy; For if she find her thus exposed, The door of virtue feels she closed Behind her, and the unhappy wretch, Whom evil-eyed suspicions stretch Upon the rack, when he hath caught His wife, shall ne'er again know aught Of peace or happiness, but die The prey of cruel Jealousy.","Ovid, The Metamorphoses The Romance of the Rose","Source: The Metamorphoses of Ovid, translated by Henry T.

Catching a Horse by Its Tail,0047a,Brother Fox Catches Mr. Horse,"One day Brer Rabbit was going along the road studying how he was going to hold his own with Brer Fox when he saw a great big horse lying stretched out flat on his side in the pasture. He crept up, he did, to see if this horse had gone and died. He crept up, and he crept around, and by and by he saw the horse switch his tail, and then Brer Rabbit knew he wasn't dead. With that, Brer Rabbit loped back to the big road, and almost the first man he saw going by was Brer Fox. Brer Rabbit, he took after him, and hollered, ""Brer Fox! O Brer Fox! Come back! I've got some good news for you. Come back, Brer Fox,"" he said. Brer Fox, he turned around, he did, and when he saw who was calling him he came galloping back, because it seemed like this was just as good a time as any to nab Brer Rabbit. But before he got within nabbing distance, Brer Rabbit, he up and said, ""Come on, Brer Fox! I just found the place where you can lay in fresh meat enough to last you plumb until the middle of next year,"" he said. Brer Fox, he asked where it was, and Brer Rabbit, he said, ""Right over there in the pasture,"" and Brer Fox asked what it was, and Brer Rabbit said it was a whole horse lying down on the ground where they could catch him and tie him up. With that, Brer Fox said, ""Come on,"" and off they went. When they got there, sure enough, they lay the horse all stretched out in the sun fast asleep, and then Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit had a dispute about how they were going to fix the horse so he could not get loose. One said one way and the other said another way, and so it was until after a while Brer Rabbit said, ""The only plan I can think of, Brer Fox, is for you to go down there and let me tie you to the horse's tail,"" he said. ""If I were a big man like you are,"" said Brer Rabbit, ""you could tie me to the horse's tail, and if I didn't hold him down, then Joe's dead and Sal's a widow. I just know that you can hold him down,"" said Brer Rabbit. ""But if you are afraid, we had just better drop this idea and study out some other plan,"" he said. Brer Fox was sort of dubious about this, but it pleased him to play biggity in front of Brer Rabbit, and he agreed to the plan. Then Brer Rabbit, he took and tied Brer Fox to the horse's tail, and after he had him tied there hard and fast, he sort of stepped back, he did, and put his hands akimbo, and grinned, and then he said, ""If there ever was a caught horse then it is this one that we caught. It sort of looks like we put the bridle on the wrong end."" With that Brer Rabbit cut himself a long switch and trimmed it up. When he had it fixed, he stepped up and hit the horse a rap -- pow! The horse was so surprised at this that he made one jump and landed on his feet. When he did that, there was Brer Fox dangling in the air. Brer Rabbit, he darted out of the way and hollered, ""Hold him down, Brer Fox! Hold him down! I'll stand out here and not get in your way. Hold him down, Brer Fox! Hold him down!"" Of course, when the horse felt Brer Fox hanging there on his tail, he thought something was the matter, and this made him jump and rear worse and worse, and he shook up Brer Fox just like he was a rag in the wind, and Brer Rabbit, he jumped and hollered, ""Hold him down, Brer Fox! Hold him down! You've got him now! Hold your grip, and hold him down!"" he said. The horse, he jumped ,and he jumped, and he ripped, and he reared, and he snorted, and he tore. But Brer Fox kept hanging on, and Brer Rabbit kept skipping around hollering, ""Hold him down, Brer Fox! You've got him where he can't get away. Hold him down, Brer Fox!"" he said. By and by, when Brer Fox got the chance, he hollered back, he did, ""How in the name of goodness am I going to hold the horse down unless I get my claws in the ground?"" Then Brer Rabbit, he stood back a little further and hollered a little louder, ""Hold him down, Brer Fox! Hold him down! You've got him now! Hold him down!"" By and by the horse began to kick with his hind legs, and the first thing you know, he fetched Brer Fox a lick in the stomach that fairly made him squall, and then he kicked him again, and this time he broke Brer Fox loose, and sent him a-whirling; and Brer Rabbit, he kept on a-jumping around and hollering, ""Hold him down, Brer Fox!""

Catching a Horse by Its Tail,0047a,Reynard Wants to Taste Horseflesh,"One day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed. Reynard was about again and came slinking along, his mouth watering for a tasty bit of the horseflesh. He sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bear, when he made a spring to the other side of the carcass, snatching a piece as he jumped across. The bear was not slow either. He made a dash after Reynard and caught the tip of his red tail in his paw. Since that time the fox has always had a white tip to his tail. ""Wait a bit, Reynard, and come here,"" said the bear, ""and I'll teach you how to catch horses."" Yes, Reynard was quite willing to learn that, but he didn't trust himself too near the bear. ""When you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place,"" said the bear, ""you must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brush, and then fasten your teeth in his thigh,"" he said. Before long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside, and so he did as the bear had told him. He knotted and tied himself well to the horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth into his thigh. Up jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop, so that Reynard was dashed against stock and stone, and was so bruised and battered that he nearly lost his senses. All at once a hare rushed by. ""Where are you off to in such a hurry, Reynard?"" asked the hare. ""I'm having a ride, Bunny!"" said the fox. The hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of his mouth split right up to his ears, at the thought of Reynard having such a grand ride; but since then the fox has never thought of catching horses again. That time it was Bruin who for once had the better of Reynard. Otherwise, they say the bear is as simple minded as the trolls.",Norway,"Source: P. C.

Catching a Horse by Its Tail,0047a,The Fox and the Horse,"A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master no longer wanted to give him anything to eat and said, ""I can certainly make no more use of you, but still I mean well by you, and if you prove yourself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain you. But for now get out of my stable."" And with that he chased him into the open field. The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. There the fox met him and said, ""Why do you hang your head so, and go about all alone?"" ""Alas,"" replied the horse, ""greed and loyalty do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plow well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out."" ""Without giving you a chance?"" asked the fox. ""The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that."" The fox said, ""I will help you. Just lie down, stretch out as if you were dead, and do not stir."" The horse did what the fox asked, and then the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, ""A dead horse is lying out there. Just come with me, and you can have a rich meal."" The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, ""After all, it is not very comfortable for you here -- I tell you what -- I will fasten it to you by the tail, and then you can drag it into your cave and eat it in peace."" This advice pleased the lion. He positioned himself, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept completely quiet. But the fox tied the lion's legs together with the horse's tail, and twisted and fastened everything so well and so strongly that no amount of strength could pull it loose. When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, ""Pull, white horse, pull!"" Then up sprang the horse at once, and pulled the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew up in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him across the field to his master's door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, ""You shall stay with me and fare well."" And he gave him plenty to eat until he died.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Der Fuchs und das Pferd, Kinder und Hausmärchen, vol. 2 (1815), no. 46.

Catching a Horse by Its Tail,0047a,The Fox and the Wolf,"Said the dog, ""I like them because they defend me."" Then he asked the dog how they defended him. Said he, ""Look behind that tree!"" Now, there stood a man with a gun. Then the wolf was terrified, ran off, and forgot about hunting until he met the fox. Now, the fox told what luck he had had. He had had good luck. He told the wolf that he found a dead horse; but the horse was lying very near a road, and he was afraid to tackle him alone. He told the wolf, however, that if he would help him carry the horse off, they would have a feast. The wolf agreed, and they went to where the dead horse was. They stopped near by. The wolf wouldn't believe the horse was dead. He told the fox to bring him a handful of hair. The fox brought him a handful of hair, and the wolf smelled it. Said he, ""Yes, he's been dead quite a while."" So now the wolf and fox consulted how to carry the dead horse away. The wolf allowed the fox to tie his tail to the dead horse's tail, and the fox took hold of his head to pull him off. When the wolf was securely tied to the horse's tail, the fox went over to his place near the head to get hold. Then suddenly he scratched the horse on the nose; and being, in truth, only asleep, the horse woke up, and dashed away, dragging the wolf. Then the fox shouted to the wolf, ""Hurrah for me, my friend!"" But the wolf cried in despair, ""How can I hurrah, when I'm up in the air?""",Native American (Chickasaw),"Source: F. G.

Hot and Cold with the Same Breath,1342,The Peasant and the Satyrs,"""Here is a chance of supper and a bed,"" thought the peasant, and he made haste to go up to the cottage door. Now this house in the clearing was not inhabited by men, but by some strange forest folk who were called satyrs. If you want to know what they were like, you must look at the pictures. Certainly the peasant had never seen anything like them before, although he had often heard of them, and when he nearly tumbled over the little satyr children who were playing in the snow outside the house door, he was the most surprised man in all those parts. It was too late to draw back however, so he went boldly up to the door and gave a loud knock. ""Come in!"" cried a gruff voice, and the peasant accordingly went in and found himself facing the father of all the satyrs, who had a long beard and a pair of horns jutting from his forehead. The poor fellow's knees trembled underneath him for fright, especially when he saw all the other satyrs, the mother and the uncles and the aunts, glowering at him. ""Please forgive me for my intrusion,"" said he, ""but I have lost my way in the woods, and I am half dead with hunger and cold. It would be an act of great kindness if you would give me some food and allow me to take shelter for the night."" So saying, to give point to his remarks, he set to work to blow upon his chilled fingers, which indeed were blue with the cold. ""Why are you blowing your fingers?"" asked the father of all the satyrs curiously. ""Why, to warm them,"" answered the peasant, and he blew harder than before. ""Well, sit down,"" said the satyr. ""As it happens we are just about to have supper, and you are welcome to share it with us."" So the peasant sat down to supper, and all the satyr family sat down too, and watched him with big unblinking eyes, so that he felt very uncomfortable. A big basin of soup was set before him, and finding it very hot, he began to blow upon it. At this all the satyr family cried out in surprise, and the father satyr said, "" Why are you blowing your soup?"" ""To cool it,"" answered the peasant. ""It is too hot, and I am afraid it may scald my mouth."" Another and a louder cry of surprise came from all the satyrs, but the father cried out loudest of all, and seemed very indignant. ""Come,"" he said, advancing to the peasant and taking him by the collar. ""Out you go! There is no place in my house for a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath. That smells too much of sorcery or magic. Out you go, I say, and practise your spells in the forest."" So the poor peasant had to go supperless and spend the night in the woods, with no shelter but the trees, and the snow for coverlet. And, if you wish to know when all this happened, all I can tell you is that it was a very long time ago, in the days when fishes flew, and cats had wings.",Flanders,"Source: Jean de Bosschère, Folk Tales of Flanders (New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company, 1918), pp. 159-62.","Flanders is the northern part of Belgium, where the native language is Flemish (Dutch).",NA

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,Brother Wolf Still in Trouble,"Brer Rabbit was walking down the road, talking and laughing to himself, when he heard something. He stopped talking and began to hum a tune, but he didn't meet anyone. Then he stopped and listened, and he heard something holler, ""Oh, Lordy! Lordy! Won't somebody come and help me?"" Brer Rabbit heard this, and he stopped and listened. It wasn't long before something or the other hollered out, ""O, Lordy, Lordy! Please, somebody, come and help me."" Brer Rabbit, he hoisted up his ears, he did, and he answered back, ""Who are you, anyhow, and what in the name of goodness is the matter?"" ""Please, somebody, run here!"" Brer Rabbit, he took and stood on three legs to make sure of getting a good start if there was any need of it, and he hollered back, ""Whereabouts are you, and how come you are there?"" ""Do, please, somebody, run here and help a poor miserable creature. I'm down here in the big gully under this here big rock."" Old Brer Rabbit crept down to the big gully and looked in, and who in the name of goodness do you suspect he saw down there? -- Nobody in the round world but that there old Brer Wolf was down there in the big gully. And, bless gracious, on top of him was a great big rock. And if you want to know the reason that the great big rock hadn't totally killed Brer Wolf, then you'll have to ask someone who knows more about it than what I do, because it looks to me like it should have smashed him flat. Yet there he was, and not only had he not been killed, but he had strength enough left to make folks a mile off hear him hollering. And he was hollering so lonesome that it made Brer Rabbit feel might sorry, and no sooner was he feeling sorry, than he held his coattails out of the way and slid down the bank in order to see what he could do. When he got down there, Brer Wolf asked him, please, sir, couldn't he help him remove that there rock. And Brer Rabbit allowed he suspected he could. And with that, Brer Wolf hollered and told him for mercy's sake, wouldn't he hurry and do it. With that, Brer Rabbit took hold of the rock and humped himself, and it wasn't long before he got some purchase on it, and bless your soul, he lifted it up, just like someone at log-rolling. It turned out that Brer Wolf wasn't hurt much, and when he found this out, he took and grabbed Brer Rabbit by the nap of the neck and the small of the back. Brer Rabbit, he kicked and squealed, but it didn't do any manner of good, because the more he kicked, the tighter Brer Wolf clamped him, and he squeezed him so hard that Brer Rabbit was afraid he was going to cut off his breath. Brer Rabbit, he allowed, ""Well then, Brer Wolf! Is this here the way you thank folks for saving your life?"" Brer Wolf grinned big, and then he up and allowed, ""I'll thank you, Brer Rabbit, and then I'll make fresh meat out of you."" Brer Rabbit allowed, he did, ""If you talk that way, Brer Wolf, I'll never do you another good turn as long as I live."" Brer Wolf, he grinned some more, and allowed, ""That you won't, Brer Rabbit. That you won't. You won't do me any more good turns until you are dead."" Brer Rabbit, he sort of studied to himself, he did, and then he allowed, ""Where I come from, Brer Wolf, it's against the law for folks to kill those that have done them a good turn, and I suspect it's against the law around here as well."" Brer Wolf said he wasn't right sure about that. Brer Rabbit said he was willing to leave the whole case with Brer Terrapin, and Brer Wolf said he was agreeable. With that, they put out, they did, and made their way to where old Brer Terrapin was staying. When they got there, Brer Wolf, he took and told his side, and then Brer Rabbit, he took and told his side. Old Brer Terrapin put on his spectacles and cleared up his throat, and then he allowed, ""Something is mixed up in this here dispute, and before I can take any side, you'll just have to take me to see the place where Brer Wolf was when Brer Rabbit found him,"" he said. Sure enough, they took old Brer Terrapin down the big road until they came to the big gully, and then they took him to where Brer Wolf got caught under the big rock. Old Brer Terrapin, he walked around, he did, and poked at the place with the end of his cane. By and by he shook his head, he did, and he allowed, ""I hate mightily to put you gents to so much trouble, yet there are no two ways about it. I'll have to see just how Brer Wolf was caught, and just how the rock was lying on top of him,"" he said. ""The older folks get, the more trouble they are,"" he said, ""and I am ripening just like a persimmon that's been struck with the frost,"" he said. Then Brer Wolf, he took and lay down where he was when Brer Rabbit found him, and the others, they up and rolled the rock on top of him, and there he was. Brer Terrapin, he walked all around and looked at him. Then he sat down, he did, and made marks in the sand with his cane like he was studying about something or the other. By and by Brer Wolf, he opened up, ""Ow, Brer Terrapin! This here rock is getting mighty heavy!"" Brer Terrapin, he marked in the sand, and studied, and studied. Brer Wolf hollered, ""Ow, Brer Terrapin! This here rock is mashing the breath out of me."" Brer Terrapin, he reared back, he did, and he allowed, ""Brer Rabbit, you were in the wrong. You didn't have any business to come along and bother Brer Wolf when he wasn't bothering you. He was tending to his own business, and you ought to have been tending to yours."" This made Brer Rabbit look ashamed of himself, but Brer Terrapin talked right along, ""When you were going down this here road this morning, you surely must have been going somewhere. If you were going somewhere, you had better be going on. Brer Wolf, he wasn't going anywhere then, and he's not going anywhere now. You found him under that rock, and you should leave him under that rock."" And bless gracious, those creatures walked off from there and left old Brer Wolf under that there rock. Return to D. L.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,"A peasant in his field once heard a voice calling, ""Help me! Help me!"" He looked around but saw no one. Finally he discovered that the voice was coming from below, from beneath a large stone. Rolling it onto its side he saw a hole where there was a large snake. It slithered out and was about to tear the peasant to pieces. ""What!"" said the peasant. ""My reward for having freed you from your prison is be torn to pieces?"" ""Didn't you know,"" replied the snake, ""that ingratitude is the world's reward?"" ""I do not believe that,"" said the peasant. ""Come, let us go together to a judge who will decide if you have the right to tear me to pieces."" So the went to seek a judge. After going a little way they came to a tree onto which was tied an old horse. ""What are you doing there?"" the peasant asked the horse. ""Who tied you here?"" ""Oh,"" it said, ""my master has gone to fetch a knacker who is to kill me, for I am too old and week to pull the plow and other loads. When I was young and strong, my master had only praise for me, but now he has no use for me, and thus I will have to die."" ""You see, peasant,"" said the snake, ""there you have proof that ingratitude is the world's reward. Now I am going to tear you to pieces."" ""No,"" said the peasant. ""Let us go to another judge."" So they went further. A dog came ran up to them and sought the peasant's protection against his master, who was about to shoot him. He had now grown unable to watch over the house, and he told the peasant that his master had held him dearly when he was young and could watch over the house and the yard, but now that he was old and weak, he had acquired another dog and wanted to shoot him. ""There you have the second proof that ingratitude is the world's reward,"" said the snake. ""You must admit that I have the right to tear you apart."" But the peasant did not want to admit this, and while they were arguing about it, a fox came their way and asked why they were quarreling. ""Wait,"" thought the peasant. ""The fox is very sly. He could be our judge."" He explained the case to him, who then took the peasant aside and said to him, ""If you will promise me two roosters then I'll free you from the snake."" ""They will be yours,"" said the peasant. ""Now,"" said the fox, ""if I am to be your judge then I must see the hole where the snake was caught. I cannot make a judgment until I have seen it."" So they turned around and went back to the hole. Upon seeing it, the fox said, ""What? Such a large snake was caught in this small hole? I do not believe it. It is entirely impossible! First you must convince me that there is room for you there. Snake, crawl inside and show me that you really were caught there."" The snake crawled inside, and he had scarcely done so when then fox quickly rolled the stone back in place, capturing him again, however much he cried out ""Help me!"" The peasant was very happy and told the fox to come that evening to fetch the roosters. He would leave the back gate to his yard open so he could get in. The fox came that evening when everyone was eating supper. He found the back gate open and crept inside. But when he neared the chicken coop, the chickens saw him and cried out. The peasant's wife heard the noise, went to see what was wrong, and discovered the fox. ""Wait,"" she said, ""I'll light the way home for you."" She ran into the kitchen, picked up a burning piece of wood, ran back to the chicken coop, and hit the fox so long with it until his pelt was all burned up. Crying out, he ran away. When he was halfway out he shouted ""Ingratitude is still the world's reward.""",Moravia,"Source: Marie Kosch, Deutsche Volksmärchen aus Mähren (Kremsier: Heinrich Gusek, 1899), pp. 107-109.",Moravia is in today's Czech Republic.,Translated by D.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,Inside Again,"A man was walking through the forest one day when he saw a funny black thing like a whip wriggling about under a big stone. He was curious to know what it all meant. So he lifted up the stone and found there a huge black snake. ""That's well,"" said the snake. ""I have been trying to get out for two days, and, Oh, how hungry I am. I must have something to eat, and there is nobody around, so I must eat you."" ""But that wouldn't be fair,"" said the man with a trembling voice. ""But for me you would never have come out from under the stone."" ""I do not care for that,"" said the snake. ""Self preservation is the first law of life; you ask anybody if that isn't so."" ""Anyone will tell you,"" said the man, ""that gratitude is a person's first duty, and surely you owe me thanks for saving your life."" ""But you haven't saved my life, if I am to die of hunger,"" said the snake. ""Oh yes, I have,"" said the man; ""all you have to do is to wait till you find something to eat."" ""Meanwhile I shall die, and what's the use of being saved!"" So they disputed and they disputed whether the case was to be decided by the claims of gratitude or the rights of self-preservation, till they did not know what to do. ""I tell you what I'll do,"" said the snake, ""I'll let the first passer-by decide which is right."" ""But I can't let my life depend upon the word of the first comer."" ""Well, we'll ask the first two that pass by."" ""Perhaps they won't agree,"" said the man; ""what are we to do then? We shall be as badly off as we are now."" ""Ah, well,"" said the snake, ""let it be the first three. In all law courts it takes three judges to make a session. We'll follow the majority of votes."" So they waited till at last there came along an old, old horse. And they put the case to him, whether gratitude should ward off death. ""I don't see why it should,"" said the horse. ""Here have I been slaving for my master for the last fifteen years, till I am thoroughly worn out, and only this morning I heard him say, 'Roger' -- that's my name -- 'is no use to me any longer; I shall have to send him to the knacker's and get a few pence for his hide and his hoofs.' There's gratitude for you."" So the horse's vote was in favor of the snake. And they waited till at last an old hound passed by limping on three legs, half blind with scarcely any teeth. So they put the case to him. ""Look at me,"" said he; ""I have slaved for my master for ten years, and this very day he has kicked me out of his house because I am no use to him any longer, and he grudged me a few bones to eat. So far as I can see nobody acts from gratitude."" ""Well,"" said the snake, ""there's two votes for me. What's the use of waiting for the third? he's sure to decide in my favor, and if he doesn't it's two to one. Come here and I'll eat you!"" ""No, no,"" said the man, ""a bargain's a bargain; perhaps the third judge will be able to convince the other two and my life will be saved."" So they waited and they waited, till at last a fox came trotting along; and they stopped him and explained to him both sides of the case. He sat up and scratched his left ear with his hind paw, and after a while he beckoned the man to come near him. And when he did so the fox whispered, ""What will you give me if I get you out of this?"" The man whispered back, ""A pair of fat chickens."" ""Well,"" said the fox, ""if I am to decide this case I must clearly understand the situation. Let me see! If I comprehend aright, the man was lying under the stone and the snake -- -- "" ""No, no,"" cried out the horse and the hound and the snake. ""It was the other way."" ""Ah, ha, I see! The stone was rolling down and the man sat on it, and then -- -- "" ""Oh, how stupid you are,"" they all cried; ""it wasn't that way at all."" ""Dear me, you are quite right. I am very stupid, but, really, you haven't explained the case quite clearly to me."" ""I'll show you,"" said the snake, impatient from his long hunger; and he twisted himself again under the stone and wriggled his tail till at last the stone settled down upon him and he couldn't move out. ""That's the way it was."" ""And that's the way it will be,"" said the fox, and, taking the man's arm, he walked off, followed by the horse and the hound. ""And now for my chickens."" ""I'll go and get them for you,"" said the man, and went up to his house, which was near, and told his wife all about it. ""But,"" she said, ""why waste a pair of chickens on a foxy old fox! I know what I'll do."" So she went into the back yard and unloosed the dog and put it into a meal-bag and gave it to the man, who took it down and gave it to the fox, who trotted off with it to his den.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,Of Nature and the Returns of Ingratitude,"An emperor rode out in the afternoon to hunt. Happening to pass a certain wood, he heard a serpent, which some shepherds had caught and bound firmly to a tree, making a most horrible clamor. Moved by pity, he loosed it, and warmed its frozen body in his own bosom. No sooner, however, did the animal find itself recovered, than it began to bite its benefactor, and shot a flood of poison into the wound. ""What have you done?"" said the emperor. ""Wherefore have you rendered evil for good?"" The serpent, like the ass of Balaam, being suddenly endowed with voice, replied, ""The propensities which nature has implanted no one can destroy. You have done what you could; and I have only acted according to my nature. You exhibited towards me all the kindness in your power, and I have recompensed you as well as I might. I offered poison, because, except poison, I had nothing to offer. Moreover, I am an enemy to man; for through him I became punished with a curse."" As they thus contended, they entreated a philosopher to judge between them, and to state which was in the wrong. ""I know this matter,"" answered the umpire, ""only by your relation; but I should like to see the thing itself upon which I am to pronounce judgment. Let the serpent, therefore, be bound to the tree, as he was in the first instance, and let my lord the emperor remain unbound; I shall then determine the matter between you."" This was done accordingly. ""Now you are bound,"" said the philosopher, addressing the serpent, loose yourself if you can."" ""I cannot,"" said the serpent; ""I am bound so fast that I can scarcely move."" ""Then die,"" rejoined the philosopher, ""by a just sentence. You were always ungrateful to man, and you always will be. My lord, you are now free. Shake the venom from your bosom, and go your way. Do not repeat your folly. Remember that the serpent is only influence by his natural propensities."" The emperor thanked the philosopher for his assistance and advice, and departed. Application: My beloved, the emperor is any good ecclesiastic, the wood is the world, and the serpent is the devil. The shepherds are the prophets, patriarchs, Christian preachers, etc. The philosopher is a discreet confessor.",Gesta Romanorum,"Source: Gesta Romanorum, translated by Charles Swan (London: George Bell and Sons, 1906), no. 174, pp. 336-37.","About the collection Gesta Romanorum: Only a few of the 283 entries of the Gesta Romanorum (Deeds of the Romans), written in Latin by an anonymous English scribe about 1330, deal with the Romans.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Brahman, the Tiger, and the Six Judges","Once upon a time a Brahman, who was walking along the road, came upon an iron cage, in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him. As the Brahman passed by, the tiger called out and said to him, ""Brother Brahman, brother Brahman, have pity on me, and let me out of this cage for one minute only, to drink a little water, for I am dying of thirst."" The Brahman answered, ""No, I will not; for if I let you out of the cage you will eat me."" ""O father of mercy,"" answered the tiger, ""in truth that will not. I will never be so ungrateful. Only let me out, that I may drink some water and return."" Then the Brahman took pity on him, and opened the cage door; but no sooner had he done so than the tiger, jumping out, said, ""Now, I will eat you first, and drink the water afterwards."" But the Brahman said, ""Only do not kill me hastily. Let us first ask the opinion of six, and if all of them say it is just and fair that you should put me to death, then I am willing to die."" ""Very well,"" answered the tiger, ""it shall be as you say. We will first ask the opinion of six."" So the Brahman and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree; and the Brahman said to it, ""Banyan tree, banyan tree, hear and give judgment."" ""On what must I give judgment ?"" asked the banyan tree. ""This tiger,"" said the Brahman,"" begged me to let him out of his cage to drink a little water, and he promised not to hurt me if I did so. But now that I have let him out he wishes to eat me. Is it just that he should do so, or no?"" The banyan tree answered, ""Men often come to take refuge in the cool shade under my boughs from the scorching rays of the sun; but when they have rested, they cut and break my pretty branches, and wantonly scatter the leaves that sheltered them. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race."" At these words the tiger would have instantly killed the Brahman; but the Brahman said, ""Tiger, tiger, you must not kill me yet, for you promised that we should first hear the judgment of six."" ""Very well,"" said the tiger, and they went on their way. After a little while they met a camel. ""Sir camel, sir camel,"" cried the Brahman, ""hear and give judgment."" ""On what shall I give judgment?"" asked the camel. And the Brahman related how the tiger had begged him to open the cage door, and promised not to eat him if he did so; and how he had afterwards determined to break his word, and asked if that were just or not. The camel replied, ""When I was young and strong, and could do much work, my master took care of me and gave me good food; but now that I am old, and have lost all my strength in his service, he overloads me, and starves me, and beats me without mercy. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are an unjust and cruel race."" The tiger would then have killed the Brahman, but the latter said, ""Stop, tiger, for we must first hear the judgment of six."" So they both went again on their way. At a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside. The Brahman said to him, ""Brother bullock, brother bullock, hear and give judgment."" ""On what must I give judgment?"" asked the bullock. The Brahman answered, ""I found this tiger in a cage, and he prayed me to open the door and let him out to drink a little water, and promised not to kill me if I did so; but when I had let him out he resolved to put me to death. Is it fair he should do so or not?"" The bullock said, ""When I was able to work, my master fed me well and tended me carefully, but now I am old he has forgotten all I did for him, and left me by the roadside to die. Let the tiger eat the man, for men have no pity."" Three out of the six had given judgment against the Brahman, but still he did not lose all hope, and determined to ask the other three. They next met an eagle flying through the air, to whom the Brahman cried, ""O eagle, great eagle, hear and give judgment."" ""On what must I give judgment?"" asked the eagle. The Brahman stated the case, but the eagle answered, ""Whenever men see me they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones. Let the tiger eat the man, for men are the persecutors of the earth."" Then the tiger began to roar, and said, ""The judgment of all is against you, O Brahman!"" But the Brahman answered, ""Stay yet a little longer, for two others must first be asked"" After this they saw an alligator, and the Brahman related the matter to him, hoping for a more favorable verdict. But the alligator said, ""Whenever I put my nose out of the water, men torment me, and try to kill me. Let the tiger eat the man, for as long as men live we shall have no rest."" The Brahman gave himself up as lost; but once more he prayed the tiger to have patience, and to let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge. Now the sixth was a jackal. The Brahman again told his story, and said to him, ""Mama jackal, mama jackal, say what is your judgment?"" The jackal answered, ""It is impossible for me to decide who is in the right and who in the wrong, unless I see the exact position in which you were when the dispute began. Show me the place."" So the Brahman and the tiger returned to the place where they first met, and the jackal went with them. When they got there, the jackal said, ""Now, Brahman, show me exactly where you stood."" ""Here,"" said the Brahman, standing by the iron tiger cage. ""Exactly there, was it?"" asked the jackal. ""Exactly here,"" replied the Brahman. ""Where was the tiger then?"" asked the jackal. ""In the cage,"" answered the tiger. ""How do you mean?"" said the jackal. ""How were you within the cage? Which way were you looking?"" ""Why, I stood so,"" said the tiger, jumping into the cage, ""and my head was on this side."" ""Very good,"" said the jackal. ""But I cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly. Was the cage door open or shut?"" ""Shut, and bolted,"" said the Brahman. ""Then shut and bolt it,"" said the jackal. When the Brahman had done this, the jackal said, ""Oh, you wicked and ungrateful tiger, when the good Brahman opened your cage door, is to eat him the only return you would make? Stay there, then, for the rest of your days, for no one will ever let you out again. Proceed on your journey, friend Brahman. Your road lies that way, and mine this.""

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Camel Driver and the Adder,"A camel driver, crossing the plains, stopped to rest where a caravan had halted and built a fire the night before; in the morning they had moved on before it had died out. As the night wind arose, it fanned the sparks and soon set all the brushwood around on fire. In the midst of the brushwood lay coiled an adder, fast asleep. The flames, however, soon awoke him, but not until he was completely encircled by the fire. He was about to despair of his life, when he saw the camel driver and called upon him for aid. At first the camel driver hesitated, for he remembered the poisonous sting of the adder. Still, he could not bear to see any living creature suffer, so he promised to help the adder. He had a bag beneath his saddle. This he now drew forth and tied to the end of his spear. He then reached it over into the midst of the burning brush; the adder crawled inside, and the camel driver drew him safely out of the fire. ""Now go your way,"" said the camel driver, loosening the neck of the bag so that the adder could glide out. ""Only remember the kindness which I have shown to you, and do you hereafter be kind to men in your turn."" ""I confess,"" replied the adder, slipping out on the ground, ""that you have been kind to me, and yet I shall not go away until I have stung both you and your camel. I only leave it to you to decide whether I shall sting you first or the camel."" ""What a monster of ingratitude you are!"" cried the camel driver. ""Is it right to return evil for good?"" Such is the custom of men,"" said the adder. ""You are not only ungrateful, but untruthful as well,"" the camel driver made reply. ""It would be hard indeed for you to prove these words of yours. There is no other creature in the world, I venture to say, who will agree with you. If you can find out one other, I will allow you to sting me."" ""Very well,"" responded the adder; ""let us put the question to yonder cow."" The cow stopped chewing her cud. ""If you mean what is man's custom,"" she began, in answer to their question, ""I must answer to my sorrow that he is wont to repay evil for good. For many years I have been the faithful servant of a farmer. Every day I have supplied him with milk to drink and rich cream for his butter. Now I am old and no longer able to serve him. So he has put me out in this pasture that I may grow fat, and only yesterday he brought the butcher to see me. Tomorrow I am to be sold for beef. Surely this is repaying my kindness with evil."" ""You see,"" said the adder to the camel driver, ""that what I said is true. Get ready for me to sting you. Shall it be you or the camel first?"" ""Hold,"" replied the camel driver. ""In court a decree is not passed without the testimony of two witnesses. Bring another witness, and if he agrees with the cow, you may do with me as you please."" The adder looked about him and saw that they were standing beneath a huge palm tree. ""Let us put the question to the tree,"" he said. When the palm had heard their question, he shook his great branches sadly. ""Experience has taught me,"" he moaned, ""that for every favor you do to men, you must expect some injury in return. I stand here in the desert, doing harm to none and good to many. Every traveler who comes by can rest beneath my shade. I bear dates for his refreshment, and gladly give my sap to quench his thirst. Yet when the traveler has eaten and slept beneath my shade, he looks up into my branches and says to himself, 'That branch would make me a good cane, or handle for my ax,' or 'What splendid wood there is in this tree! I must cut off a limb to make some new doors for my house.' And I must consent to this without a murmur. Thus is my kindness returned by men."" ""The two witnesses have now testified,"" spoke the adder, ""and agree. Which shall I bite first, you or the camel?"" But just at that moment a fox ran by, and the camel driver pleaded that they might hear one more testimony. The adder was so pleased with what the cow and the tree had said, that he readily agreed to listen to the fox. When the camel driver had finished telling the whole tale to the fox, the fox laughed out loud. ""You seem to be a clever fellow,"" he replied to the camel driver. ""Why do you tell me such a falsehood?"" ""Indeed, he is telling you nothing but the truth,"" the adder hastened to assure the fox. Again the fox laughed outright. ""Do you mean to tell me,"" he asked scornfully, ""that such a large adder as you could possibly get into such a small bag?"" ""If you do not believe it, I will crawl in again and show you,"" answered the adder. ""Well,"" responded the fox, thoughtfully, ""if I see you in there with my own eyes, then I will consent to give my answer to your question."" The camel driver straightway held the bag open, and the adder crept in and coiled up in the bottom. ""Be quick now,"" cried the fox, ""and draw the string. Any creature so lacking in gratitude as this adder deserves nothing but death.""",Bidpai,"Source: The Tortoise and the Geese and other Fables of Bidpai, retold by Maude Barrows Dutton (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1908), pp. 118-25.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Crocodile, the Brahman, and the Fox","A crocodile beseeched a Brahman to carry it to Benares, so it could live in the Ganges. Touched with compassion, the Brahman put the crocodile into his bag and carried it to the holy river. However, just as he was about to release the crocodile into the water, the latter seized him, and was about to kill him. The Brahman accused his captor of ingratitude, who in turn replied that virtue and custom allowed one to eat the person who had sustained him. The Brahman insisted that three impartial judges should decide the case, and declared himself willing to abide by their decision. They turned first to a mango tree, whom the Brahman asked if it were permitted to repay a good deed with evil. The mango tree replied that such was the treatment he and his kind always received from humans. ""They partake of our fruits and of our shade, and then uproot us,"" it said. Next they turned to an old cow. She too said that humans had abandoned her after she was of no more use to them. Any moment she expected to fall prey to a wild animal. They still needed a third judgment, and for this they turned to a fox. He too seemed inclined against the Brahman, but before finalizing his decision, he wanted to see how the two had journeyed together. To demonstrate, the unsuspecting crocodile crept back into the Brahman's bag. Acting on a cue from the fox, the Braham struck the now helpless crocodile dead with a stone, and the fox ate it up.",India,"Source: Theodor Benfey, Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen (Leipzig: F.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Farmer, the Crocodile, and the Jackal","There was once a wily old crocodile who dwelt in a tank [pond] hard by a village, and he was sometimes so ferocious that he would seize children who used to go for water there, then drown and eat them. He had become, in fact, the terror of the place. One year there was a very great drought, and the tank by degrees began to dry up, and at last it got quite dry, and the crocodile was to be seen grilling and roasting in the sun. He used to call out to the passers-by, ""Oh! pray take pity upon me and show me where I can go for water, for I am dying in this heat."" ""No, indeed! they all said. ""We are glad to see you suffering, for have you not often made us suffer by taking our goats, and sometimes even our children? We shall not help you in any way."" At last an old man passed by, and the crocodile appealed to him, and at first he replied as the others did, but afterwards he relented and said, ""Well, if you will follow me I will take you to a tank which is never dry."" So the crocodile followed him, and he showed him a tank no great distance off, which was filled with water. The old man went first into the tank himself, and calling to the crocodile, he said, ""See here, how deep it is!"" No sooner had the crocodile had a good drink, than he made a grab at the old man's leg. ""Ah-ho! Ah-ho!"" said the old man. ""What are you doing?"" ""Well,"" replied the crocodile, ""I have had a good drink, thanks to you, and as I have had no food for many days, I am going to make a meal of you. That is what I am going to do."" ""You wretched and ungrateful brute!"" said the old man. ""Is this the way you reward me?"" At that moment a jackal hove in sight, coming for a drink (the jackals, we know, are the most cunning of all animals), and the old man said, ""I will put my case before him, and if he says you are to eat me, very good, so you shall."" The old man then beckoned to the jackal to come close up to the tank, and told him all the facts of the case. The jackal said, ""You know I am always a just judge, and if you want me to decide, you must show me the place from whence you brought the crocodile."" So they all three wended their way back to the tank near the village, and the jackal said, ""Show me the exact spot where you first found the crocodile,"" and when they got there the jackal said, ""Now I am going to give you my judgment, so prepare to listen."" Then turning to the old man, he said quietly, ""You silly old idiot! What made you ever help a crocodile? Now, you run one way, and I will run the other."" The jackal gave a skip, and was soon off out of sight, and the old man took to his heels also, and soon got away. The wily old crocodile, now balked of his prey, said to himself, ""I know my way back to that water tank, and I will someday have my revenge on that jackal, for he is sure to come there to lap water."" So back he went, and as there were many trees near the tank, some of whose roots went beneath the water, the crocodile lay in ambush there. By and by the jackal came to drink water, and the crocodile made a sudden snap at his leg, and held it. ""Oh, you foolish crocodile!"" the jackal said, ""you think you have got hold of my leg, do you? But it is only the root of a tree."" Hearing this, the crocodile released his hold, and the jackal jumped off in high glee out of his reach. The crocodile then determined that he would try some other plan of entrapping him. So, as there were great numbers of a small fruit falling from one of the trees, which he knew the jackal came to eat, he one night piled up a heap and hid himself beneath it, leaving only his eyes uncovered. Presently the jackal came prowling along, and noticing the pile of fruit he felt inclined to partake of some, but he drew near very cautiously, and in a moment he caught sight of the two eyes of the crocodile glistening in the moonlight, when he called out, ""Oh, I see you!"" and scampered off. After this, the crocodile saw that it was no use to try himself to catch the jackal, ""for,"" said he, ""he is too cunning for me. I must employ someone who comes to get water here."" So one day he saw a farmer, and said to him, ""If you will catch a jackal for me, I will make you a rich man, for I will give you several jewels which people have dropped in this tank for years and years, and they are lying here at the bottom."" ""Oh!"" replied the farmer, ""that is easily done."" So that very night he went into the jungle and lay down as if dead. Presently the jackal made his appearance, and smelling along he came close up to the body. Then he hesitated and said, ""I wonder if this is really a dead body or not."" He then called out audibly, ""If it is really dead it will shake its leg, and if it is alive it won't do so."" This he said so quickly and so artfully that the farmer was taken aback, and to make him believe he was dead he at once stupidly shook his leg, and off skipped the jackal, saying, ""I caught you there,"" and was lost to view in an instant. The farmer, who was very avaricious, and wanted the jewels badly, made up his mind that he would by hook or by crook make sure of the jackal on the next occasion. So this time he prepared of the softest wax a doll the size of a child, and digging a small grave and covering it over with leaves and mud, he waited in hiding to see the result. Shortly after sunset the jackal began to prowl about as usual, and coming on the new grave he said to himself, ""Ah! This is someone lately buried. I will try my luck here."" He then began to scratch with his paw, and presently one paw got caught in the wax, and in trying to get that away, all four became stuck with the wax, when in a moment out came the farmer from his hiding place and said, ""Ah! At last I have got you, and you are my prisoner!"" The jackal yelled and howled, and endeavored to escape, but was hindered by the wax on his feet. So then he took to frightening the farmer, and said, ""If you do not get me out of this scrape I will call all the jackals in a moment of time, and they will destroy you forever, for do you not know that I am the king of the jackals?"" ""What am I to do?"" asked the farmer. ""Go!"" he said. ""Go and get some oil, and rub it all over me. Then get a fowl, and tie it about fifty yards away, and bring two men with hatchets to stand over me, so that if I attempt to get away they may chop me to pieces!"" This being done by the farmer, the jackal while being held in his hands sought his opportunity, and being well greased all over, he made a violent spring and so got clear of the farmer. Then he dashed between the legs of the men with hatchets, when they made a plunge at him, but they only succeeded in hurting their own legs. So the jackal got finally off, and picking up the fowl, he was soon lost to view, and so won the day.",Pakistan,"Source: J. F. A.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Ingrates,"There was once a man who went into the forest to gather wood, and saw a snake crushed under a large stone. He raised the stone a little with the handle of his axe, and the snake crawled out. When it was at liberty, it said to the man, ""I am going to eat you."" The man answered, ""Softly. First let us hear the judgment of someone, and if I am condemned, then you shall eat me."" The first one they met was a horse as thin as a stick, tied to an oak tree. He had eaten the leaves as far as he could reach, for he was famished. The snake said to him, ""Is it right for me to eat this man who has saved my life?"" The nag answered, ""More than right. Just look at me! I was one of the finest horses. I have carried my master so many years, and what have I gained? Now that I am so badly off that I can no longer work they have tied me to this oak, and after I have eaten these few leaves I shall die of hunger. Eat the man, then. For he who does good is ill rewarded, and he who does evil must be well rewarded. Eat him, for you will be doing a good day's work."" They afterwards happened to find a mulberry tree, all holes, for it was eaten by old age. And the snake asked it if it was right to eat the man who had saved its life. ""Yes,"" the tree answered at once, ""for I have given my master so many leaves that he has raised from them the finest silkworms in the world. Now that I can no longer stand upright, he has said that he is going to throw me into the fire. Eat him, then, for you will do well."" Afterwards they met the fox. The man took her aside and begged her to pronounce in his favor. The fox said, ""The better to render judgment I must see just how the matter has happened."" They all returned to the spot and arranged matters as they were at first. But as soon as the man saw the snake under the stone he cried out, ""Where you are, there I will leave you."" And there the snake remained. The fox wished in payment a bag of hens, and the man promised them to her for the next morning. The fox went there in the morning, and when the man saw her he put some dogs in the bag, and told the fox not to eat the hens close by, for fear the mistress of the house would hear it.

Afterwards the mud dried and became hard, so the crocodile was unable to get out of the hole. He was going to die. A man passed by on his was to fetch a midwife to attend to his wife.

As there was no water left in the tank, the man placed the crocodile on his shoulder and went to the edge of the river. He then placed the crocodile into the water, but no sooner had he done so than the crocodile seized him by the arm and was about to eat him. ""Why are you going to eat me?"" he asked. ""Do you not know how I helped you? And still you are going to eat me!"" The crocodile said, ""It is true, indeed, that you helped me. But I am going to eat you, because I am hungry."" The man said, ""It is good. You may eat me, but first let as ask two or three persons as witnesses."" So they went to ask the witnesses about it. They came to a kumbuk tree, and the man said to it, ""This crocodile is going to eat me. I am asking your opinion of it."" ""What is it all about?"" The man said, ""This crocodile was going to die. I saved him. Now he is going to eat me. Is that right?"" The kumbuk tree said, ""O crocodile, do not let that man go. There is no animal so wicked as that man. He stays near a tree in its shade, then he breaks off its bark and leaves and takes them away. In the end he cuts it down and takes the whole tree."" From there he went and asked a cow, ""O cow, I saved this crocodile from death. He is now going to eat me. Do you think that is right?"" The cow said, ""O crocodile, do not let that man go. That man is a wicked man. He takes our milk, and in the end he kills and eats us. Do not let him go."" After that he asked a jackal about it. The jackal asked, ""What is it all about?""

The lion promised, and the horse dug with his hooves until he had freed the lion. However, as soon as the lion saw that he was free, he said, ""Now I am going to eat you."" ""What were the conditions?"" said the horse. ""Did we not agree that you would not eat me?"" ""That makes no difference now,"" shouted the lion. ""But if you want to, we can go before a judge."" ""Good,"" replied the horse. ""But whom shall we choose?"" ""The fox,"" said the lion. The horse agreed to this, so they went to the fox, and the lion presented him with the question. ""Yes,"" answered the fox, ""it seems to me that you must be right, Mr. Lion, but I cannot finalize my judgment until I have seen how the two of you were standing."" So all three of them went to the rocky cleft, and the horse positioned himself in the same place he had stood. Then the fox told the lion to force himself back into the cleft. ""Is that how you were standing?"" he asked. ""This leg was a little more twisted,"" answered the lion. ""Then push yourself in a little more tightly. You must be in exactly the same position as you were when you asked the horse for help."" The lion pushed himself in a little more, and the fox asked again, ""Is that exactly how you were standing?"" ""This front leg was a little further inside."" ""Then push yourself in still a little more."" Finally the lion had pushed himself in so tightly that he could not get out again. ""So,"" said the fox. ""now you are exactly where you were before. Now the horse can decide whether he will help you out again."" The horse, however, did not want to do so, but instead threw stones at the lion until he was dead.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Man, the Serpent, and the Fox","There was once a huntsman, who, in passing a quarry, found a serpent under a large stone. The serpent asked the hunter to liberate him, but the latter said, ""I will not free you, for you will eat me."" The serpent replied, ""Liberate me, for I will not eat you."" When the hunter had set the serpent at liberty, the latter wanted to devour him, but the hunter said, ""What are you doing? Did you not promise me that you would not eat me?"" The serpent replied that hunger did not observe promises. The hunter then said, ""If you have no right to eat me, will you do it?"" ""No,"" answered the serpent. ""Let us go, then,"" said the hunter, ""and ask three times."" They went into the woods and found a greyhound, and asked him, and he replied, ""I had a master, and I went hunting and caught hares, and when I carried them home my master had nothing too good to give me to eat. No, when I cannot overtake even a tortoise, because I am old, my master wishes to kill me. For this reason I condemn you to be eaten by the serpent, for he who does good finds evil."" ""Do you hear? We have one judge,"" said the serpent. They continued their journey, and found a horse, and asked him, and he too replied that the serpent was right to eat the man, ""for,"" he said, ""I had a master who fed me when I could travel. Now that I can do so no longer, he would like to hang me."" The serpent said, ""Behold, two judges!"" They went on and found a fox. The huntsman said, ""Fox, you must aid me. Listen: I was passing quarry and found this serpent dying under a large stone, and he asked aid from me, and I released him, and now he wants to eat me."" The fox answered, ""I will be the judge. Let us return to the quarry to see how the serpent was."" They went there and put the stone on the serpent, and the fox asked, ""Is that the way you were?"" ""Yes,"" answered the serpent.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Peasant, the Snake, and King Solomon","Once upon a time, when King Solomon the wise ruled over the people, some shepherds gathered under a tree and lit a fire, not for any special reason, but just to pass their time, as they often do. When they left, they did not take care to put the fire out. It was left burning under the ashes. Spreading slowly, it caught the great tree, which soon afterwards became a mass of living flames. A snake had crept onto that tree before and found itself now in danger of perishing in the flames. Creeping upwards to the very top of the tree, the snake cried as loud as it could, for she felt her skin scorched by the fire. At that moment a man passed by, and hearing the shrieking of the snake, who begged him to save her from the flames, he took pity on her, and cutting a long stick, he reached with it up to the top of the tree for the snake to glide down on it. But he did not know the mind of the cunning beast, which had aforetime deceived his forefather Adam, for, instead of gliding down to the ground, no sooner did the snake reach the neck of the good man than she coiled herself round and round his neck. In vain did he remind her that he had saved her life. She would not hear of anything, for she said, ""My skin is dearer to me than to you, and I remain where I am. You cannot shake me off."" Finding that he could not get rid of the snake, the man went from judge to judge, from king to king, to decide between them, but no one could help him. At last, hearing of the wisdom of King Solomon, he came to him and laid his case before him. But King Solomon said, ""I am not going to judge between you unless you both first promise to abide by my word."" Both did so. Turning to the snake, King Solomon then said, ""You must uncoil yourself and get down on the earth, for I cannot judge fairly between one who is standing on the ground and one who is riding."" Cunning though the snake may be, she did not understand the wisdom of King Solomon, and therefore, uncoiling herself, she glided down and rested on the ground. Turning to the man, King Solomon said, ""Do you not know that you must never trust a snake?"" The man at once understood what the king meant, and taking up a stone, he bruised the snake's head. And thus justice was done.",Romania,"Source: M. Gaster, Rumanian Bird and Beast Stories (London: Folk-Lore Society, 1915), no. 112, pp. 325-26.",NA,NA
Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Reward of Good Deeds,"There was once a man who went into the woods to cut some firewood. He went from one tree to another, but they were all too good for his purpose, as they would make good timber if allowed to stand. At last he found a tree which seemed good for nothing; it was gnarled and partly decayed, so he began to hew away at it. But just as he began to cut, he heard a voice calling to him, ""Help me out, my good man."" And as he turned he saw a large viper that was caught in a cleft of the tree and could not free itself. ""No, I will not help you,"" said the man, ""for you would harm me."" But the viper said that it would not hurt him, if he would only free it. Then the man put his axe into the cleft under the snake, and so freed it. But hardly was it free, when it coiled itself up, hissed, put out its tongue and prepared to strike him. ""Did I not tell you,"" said the man, ""that you were a rascal who would reward good with evil!"" ""Yes,"" answered the viper, ""you may well say that; but so it is in the world, that all good deeds are rewarded with evil."" ""That is not true,"" said the man, ""good deeds are rewarded with good."" ""You will not find anybody to agree with you there,"" said the viper. ""I know better how it goes in the world."" ""Let us inquire about it,"" said the man. ""Very well,"" said the viper. So it did not bite him, but went with him through the forest until they came to an old, worn out horse that was grazing. It was lame, and blind in one eye, and had only a few broken teeth in its mouth. They asked him whether good deeds were rewarded with good, or with evil. ""They are rewarded with evil,"" said the horse. ""For twenty years I have served my master faithfully; I have carried him on my back, and drawn his wagon, and have taken care not to stumble lest he fall. As long as I was young and strong, I had kind treatment; I had a good stall, and plenty of food, and was well curried. But now that I am old and weak, I must work in the treadmill the livelong day; I never have a roof to cover me, and all the food I have is what I get for myself. No, indeed, good deeds are rewarded only with evil."" ""There now, you hear,"" said the viper, ""Now I shall bite you."" ""Oh, no! wait a moment,"" said the man, ""there comes the fox; let us ask him for his opinion."" The fox came up and stopped and looked at them, for he saw that the man was in serious trouble. Then the viper asked the fox whether good deeds were rewarded with evil or with good. ""Say 'with good,'"" whispered the man, ""and I will give you two fat geese."" Then the fox said, ""Good deeds are rewarded with good,"" and as he said that he jumped on the viper and bit its neck so that it fell to the ground. But as it was dying it insisted, ""No, good deeds are rewarded with evil; that I have experienced, I, who spared the man's life, who has now cheated me out of mine."" Now the viper was dead and the man was free. Then he said to the fox, ""Come home with me and get your geese."" ""No, I thank you,"" said the fox, ""I will not go to town, for there the dogs would get me."" ""Then wait here until I come with the geese,"" said the man. He ran home and said to his wife, ""Hasten and put two fat geese into a sack, for I have promised them to the fox for his breakfast today."" The woman took a sack and put something into it; but it was not geese she put in, but two fierce dogs. The man then ran out with the bag to the fox, and said, ""Here you have your reward."" ""Thank you,"" said the fox, ""then it was not a lie after all, what I said first -- that good deeds are rewarded with good."" Then taking the bag on his back he ran off into the woods. ""That sack is heavy,"" said the fox, so he sat down and tore it open with his sharp teeth. But as he did so the two dogs leaped from the bag and fixed their teeth in his throat. There was no escape from them, so he was bitten to death, but not until he had said, ""No, what I said first was a lie, after all; good deeds are rewarded with evil.""",Denmark,"Source: Sven Grundtvig, Danish Fairy Tales, translated by J.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Reward of Kindness,"""I'll teach that bear a lesson!"" the farmer thought to himself. So he set a snare made of a strong net and carefully covered it over with leaves and branches. That day Osmo, when he came as usual to the field, got entangled in the net and was unable to escape. The farmer when he came and found him securely caught was overjoyed. ""Now, you brute!"" he said, ""I've got you and I'm going to kill you!"" ""Oh, master, don't do that!"" the bear implored. ""Don't kill me!"" ""Why shouldn't I kill you?"" the farmer asked. ""Aren't you destroying my rye?"" ""Let me off this time!"" Osmo begged, ""and I'll reward you! I swear I will!"" He begged and begged until at last he prevailed upon the farmer to open the net and let him out. ""Now then,"" the farmer said as soon as the bear was freed, ""how are you going to reward me?"" Osmo put a heavy paw on the farmer's shoulder. ""This is how I'm going to reward you,"" he said: ""I'm going to eat you up !"" ""What!"" the farmer exclaimed. ""Is that your idea of a reward for kindness?"" ""Exactly!"" Osmo declared. ""In this world that is the reward kindness always gets! Ask anyone!"" ""I don't believe it! I don't believe it!"" the farmer cried. ""Very well. I'll prove to you that I'm right. We'll ask the first person we meet."" The first person they met was an old horse. They put their case to him. ""The bear is right,"" the old horse said. ""Look at me. For thirty years I gave my master faithful service and just this morning I heard him say, 'It's time we killed that old plug! He's no good for work any more and he's only eating his head off!'"" The bear squinted his little eyes. ""You see!"" ""No, I don't see!"" the farmer insisted. ""We must ask someone else."" They walked on a little farther until they met an old dog. They put their case to him and at once the dog said, ""The bear is right! Look at me. I gave my master a life time of faithful service and just this morning I overheard him say: 'It's time we killed that old dog!' Alas, alas, in this wicked world goodness is always so rewarded!"" But still the farmer was unsatisfied and to humor him Osmo said that he was willing that they should put their case once more to the judgment of an outsider. The next person they met was Mikko, the fox. Mikko listened carefully and then drawing the farmer aside he whispered, ""If I give judgment in your favor will you let me carry off all the chickens in your henhouse?"" ""Indeed I will!"" the farmer promised. Then Mikko cleared his throat importantly and said, ""H'm! H'm! To give fair judgment in this case I must go over all the ground. First show me the field of rye and the damage Osmo did."" So they went to the field and the fox, after he had appraised the damage, shook his head seriously. ""It was certainly wicked of Osmo eating all that rye!... Now show me the net."" So they went to the snare and the fox examined it carefully. ""You say the bear got entangled in this snare. I want to see just how he did it."" Osmo showed just how he had been caught. ""Get all the way in,"" the fox said. ""I want to make sure that you couldn't possibly get out unaided."" So the bear entangled himself again in the net and proved that he couldn't possibly get out unaided. ""Well,"" said Mikko, the rascal, ""you deserved to get caught the first time and now that you're in there again you can just stay there! Come on, Mr. Farmer."" So Mikko and the farmer went off leaving Osmo to his fate. That night the fox went to the farmer's henhouse to claim his reward. When he came in the chickens, of course, set up an awful squawking that aroused the family. The farmer stayed in bed but he sent his wife out with a stout club. ""It sounds to me,"" he said, ""as if some rascally fox is trying to steal our hens. If you catch him, don't be gentle with him!"" ""Gentle!"" repeated the wife significantly. She hurried out to the henhouse and when she found Mikko inside she gave him an awful beating. In fact he barely escaped with his life. ""Ah!"" he said to himself as he limped painfully home, ""to think that this is the reward my kindness has received! Oh, what a wicked, wicked world this is!""",Finland,"Source: Parker Fillmore, Mighty Mikko: A Book of Finnish Fairy and Folk Tales (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company, 1922), pp. 301-305.",NA,NA
Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Snake's Thanks,"""Poor thing,"" said he, ""it will soon die if it remain here much longer. Do we not read in God's Holy Bible that we must be merciful to all things which he has made? I will pick up the poor snake and try to revive it."" He hastened to take it up, and in order to give it a little warmth he put it under his coat close to his chest. It did not take very many minutes to warm it. The man was soon aware of the snake's recovery, for it began to coil its slimy body around him. Its pressure became gradually greater and greater till the man cried out in alarm: ""Hold on! What art thou doing? Why dost thou squeeze me to death? Had it not been for my kindness and sympathy thou wouldst by now have perished on the roadside. When I picked thee up thou wast almost frozen to death. I have given thee back thy life and in return thou seekest to kill me. Is it right to return evil for good? Is this thy way of thanking those who help thee?"" ""Thou art a very nice old man. But thou dost not seem to remember what I am. Tell me that first."" ""Thou art a snake."" ""Exactly. I am therefore quite in order in killing thee and any man. Snakes are made to kill the children of men."" ""Come, Master Snake. Let us put our case before a judge and let us hear what he has to say."" ""Very well, I agree to do this. Before whom shall we state our case?"" ""Before the first creature that we meet on the road."" On and on they went till at last they saw an ox coming along. The old man was pleased and called out: ""Please, Master Ox, oblige this snake on my neck and me by standing here for a few minutes."" ""What do ye want?"" ""We wish thee to judge between us."" ""What's the matter?"" ""I found this snake perishing with cold. To save its life I put it on my chest under my coat."" ""That was indeed most kind,"" said the ox. ""I then found that as soon as the snake revived it wanted to strangle me. Please decide whether that was right, and if not, kindly order the snake to release its hold on me and to depart in peace."" ""Now, Master Snake, what hast thou to say for thyself?"" ""Yes, I admit that this good man speaks the truth. But I am quite right in trying to kill him."" ""How so?"" ""Because it is written in God's book: I will put hatred between mankind and the serpent."" ""Now,"" said the ox, ""I have duly heard both sides. I find that the snake is in the right. It makes no difference that thou hast done it a good service and in return it kills thee. The world always returns evil for good. That is the way of life as far as I know it. Just see how I fare at the hands of my master. I work for him in his field from sunrise to sunset. At night I am shut up in a cold shed with a little hay and some oats for my food. My master sits in his cozy room with a lovely bright fire to warm him. He has a nice supper of fine fish and good meat. He even drinks sweet wine whereas I only get cold water. He sleeps in a clean soft bed whilst I have not even a coverlet over my back. In a year or two when I am no longer able to work in the field he will sell me to the butcher who will kill me."" These words grieved the poor old man very much. ""I am not satisfied with this judge,"" he cried aloud. Leaving the ox behind he went on his way with the snake coiled around his neck. ""Let us try again, if it please thee,"" said the snake. ""We will ask the next creature that we meet. I am sure I will win the case."" ""Wait and see, Master Snake. Ah! here comes thy friend the ass. We will ask him to be the judge."" ""By all means."" They both told their story in turn to the ass, just as they had told the ox. The ass also quoted the same words of the Bible as the ox. After a long tale of his own sorrows at the hands of ungrateful man, the ass decided that the snake was in the right. ""See!"" cried the snake, ""Did I not say that I should win? I shall now kill thee and know that I am doing the right thing."" ""Stay, Master Snake, let us be fair. We have asked two animals to judge between us. Let us also put the case before a man. It is natural that animals should judge in thy favor, for they are thy kinsmen. Come before David, King of Israel. He is a good man and will speak as is right."" ""Very good, I agree."" When they came before the king, he listened very attentively to both of them. Turning to the old man, David said: ""Why hast thou not kept the Holy Law! It tells us that God has put hatred between thee and the serpent. Thou hast forgotten this, and now I fear I cannot help thee."" ""Ah!"" cried the snake in a spiteful voice, ""I am in the right."" The poor man left the king's presence with a very sad heart, for the snake was beginning to squeeze him more tightly than ever. He had now given up all hope. He feared that the snake would kill him before nightfall. On and on he wandered with a heavy step, leaning heavily on his stick. At last he felt so wretched that he sat down by the side of a well saying to himself, ""I will die here, and the snake may fall into the well and get drowned."" He saw a handsome lad near by who came running up to him and said: ""Peace be unto thee."" ""Peace be also unto thee, my son."" ""What aileth thee, for thy face is as white as a sheet!"" ""I am nigh unto death."" ""Can I fetch thee a little water!"" ""Nay, dear son, many thanks. I have just left King David. Alas! he cannot save my life, and I must die."" ""Tell me thy trouble. Perhaps I can help thee."" The old man then told him all about the snake and showed him how it had entwined itself around his neck. ""Just wait here for a few minutes and then I will go with thee to King David. Thy case shall be retried, and justice will be done. I must just stay a little while here by the well. My stick fell into it, and I told my attendants to dig up the ground yonder where the source of the well lies. This will cause the water in the well to increase. My stick, of course, floats on the surface. As soon as the water rises near the top of the well I can reach it, and as soon as I get it we will go to the King."" This action of the lad seemed very clever in the eyes of the old man. He therefore resolved to return with him to the king. At last they came before David. The lad, who was Solomon, the king's son, fell on his face to the ground. His father told him to rise up. He did so and kissed the king's hand. ""May I speak, dear father?"" ""Speak, my son."" ""Why didst thou not decide this man's case in his favor?"" ""Because it serves him right to find himself in his present unfortunate state."" ""How so, father dear?"" ""Because he did not act according to the teaching of the Holy Law."" ""O father, give me, I beseech thee, permission to sit in judgment in this case."" ""Most gladly will I do so, if thou wilt be able to prove to me that I have not done justice to this unlucky man. Come, beloved son, and sit on my chair of state. I will listen to thy words of wisdom. May the God of my fathers be with thee in judgment!"" Solomon sat on his father's chair and began to say to the snake: ""Tell me, why dost thou do evil to one who has dealt kindly with thee?"" ""God has commanded me to do so."" ""Where!"" ""In his Law."" ""Dost thou agree to abide by the teaching of the Law!"" ""Of course I do."" ""Now at once get off this man and stand on the ground even as he does."" ""Why should I?"" ""Because the Holy Law demands that those who have a quarrel shall stand before the judge."" [Deuteronomy 19:17] ""I quite agree to do this. Now wilt thou judge between me and this man."" The snake uncoiled its body and placed itself beside the old man. Solomon then turned to the old man and said: ""The Holy Law has also a command for thee. It tells thee that thou shalt bruise the serpent's head. Do now according to the word of thy God."" The old man no sooner heard Solomon's words than he raised his stick on which he was leaning and smote the snake a deadly blow on its head. The next second it was dead. King David and his courtiers were astonished at the wonderful wisdom of Solomon, whose fame soon spread throughout the land.

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal","Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed. By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger. ""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."" ""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths. ""On the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"" Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"" In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life. The most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action. So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper. Be a man!"" Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well wheel. But he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton seed and oil cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here and give me refuse as fodder!"" The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion. ""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"" On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"" The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended. ""Would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"" The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand. ""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."" So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws. ""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."" ""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright. ""What a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"" ""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."" The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible. ""Oh, my poor brain! Oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! How did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger cam walking by --"" ""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."" ""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright. ""Yes! I was in the cage -- no I wasn't -- dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me see -- the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by -- no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"" ""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity. ""I'll make you understand! Look here -- I am the tiger --"" ""Yes, my lord!"" ""And that is the Brahman --"" ""Yes, my lord!"" ""And that is the cage --"" ""Yes, my lord!"" ""And I was in the cage. Do you understand?"" ""Yes -- no -- please, my lord --"" ""Well?"" cried the tiger impatiently. ""Please, my lord! How did you get in?"" ""How! Why in the usual way, of course!"" ""Oh, dear me! -- My head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't be angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?"" At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, ""This way!

Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Unmannerly Tiger,"One day in autumn, Mountain Uncle was rambling among the lower hills. Though far from any village, he kept a sharp lookout for traps and hunters, but none seemed to be near. He was very hungry and hoped for game. But on coming round a great rock, Mountain Uncle suddenly saw in his path some feet ahead, as he thought, a big tiger like himself. He stopped, twitched his tail most ferociously as a challenge, showed fight by growling, and got ready to spring. What was his surprise to see the other tiger doing exactly the same things. Mountain Uncle was sure that there would be a terrible struggle, but this was just what he wanted, for he expected of course to win. But after a tremendous leap in the air, he landed in a pit and all of a heap, bruised and disappointed. There was no tiger to be seen, but instead a heavy lid of logs had closed over his head with a crash and he lay in darkness. Old Mountain Uncle at last was caught. Yes, the hunter had concealed the pit with sticks and leaves, and on the upright timbers, covered with vines and brushwood, had hung a bit of looking-glass. Mountain Uncle had often beheld his own face and body in the water, when he stooped to drink, but this time, not seeing any water, he was deceived into thinking a real tiger wanted to fight him. By and by a Buddhist priest came along, who believed in being kind to all living creatures. Hearing an animal moaning, he opened the trap and lifting the lid saw old Mountain Uncle at the bottom licking his bruised paw. ""Oh, please, Mr. Man, let me get out. I'm hurt badly,"" said the tiger. Thereupon the priest lifted up one of the logs and slid it down, until it rested on the bottom of the pit. Then the tiger climbed up and out. Old Mountain Uncle expressed his thanks volubly, saying to the shaven head, ""I am deeply grateful to you, sir, for helping me out of my trouble. Nevertheless, as I am very hungry, I must eat you up."" The priest, very much surprised and indignant, protested against such vile ingratitude. To say the least, it was very bad manners and entirely against the law of the mountains, and he appealed to a big tree to decide between them. The spirit in the tree spoke through the rustling leaves and declared that the man should go free and that the tiger was both ungrateful and unmannerly. Old Mountain Uncle was not satisfied yet, especially as the priest was unusually fat and would make a very good dinner. However, he allowed the man to appeal once more and this time to a big rock. ""The man is certainly right, Venerable Mountain Uncle, and you are wholly wrong,"" said the spirit in the rock. ""Your master, the Mountain Spirit, who rides on the green bull and the piebald horse to punish his enemies, will certainly chastise you if you devour this priest. You will be no fit messenger of the Mountain Lord if you are so ungrateful as to eat the man who saved you from starvation or death in the trap. It is shockingly bad manners even to think of such a thing."" The tiger felt ashamed, but his eyes still glared with hunger; so, to be sure of saving his own skin, the priest proposed to make the toad a judge. The tiger agreed. But the toad, with his gold-rimmed eyes, looked very wise, and instead of answering quickly, as the tree and rock did, deliberated a long time. The priest's heart sank, while the tiger moved his jaws as if anticipating his feast. He felt sure that Old Speckled Back would decide in his favor. ""I must go and see the trap before I can make up my mind,"" said the toad, who looked as solemn as a magistrate. So all three leaped, hopped, or walked to the trap. The tiger, moving fast, was there first, which was just what the toad, who was a friend of the priest, wanted. Besides, Old Speckled Back was diligently looking for a crack in the rocks nearby. So, while the toad and the tiger were studying the matter, the priest ran off and saved himself within the monastery gates. When at last Old Speckled Back decided against Mountain Uncle and in favor of the man, he had no sooner finished his judgment than he hopped into the rock crevice, and, crawling far inside, defied the tiger, calling him an unmannerly brute and an ungrateful beast, and daring him to do his worst. Old Mountain Uncle was so mad with rage and hunger that his craftiness seemed turned into stupidity. He clawed at the rock to pull it open to get at the toad to tear him to pieces. But Speckled Back, safe within, only laughed. Unable to do any harm, the tiger flew into a passion of rage. The hotter his temper grew, the more he lost his wit. Poking his nose inside the crack, he rubbed it so hard on the rough rock that he soon bled to death. When the hunter came along, he marveled at what he saw, but he was glad to get rich by selling the tiger's fur, bones, and claws ; for in Korea nothing sells so well as a tiger. As for the toad, he told to several generations of his descendants the story of how he outwitted the old Mountain Uncle.",Korea,"Source: William Elliot Griffis, The Unmannerly Tiger, and Other Korean Tales (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 1911), pp. 1-6.",NA,NA
Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The World's Reward,"That minute he heard a cry, and someone called, ""Oh, good man, take pity on me! Roll off the stone and save my life. Free me, and I will pay you as the world pays best!"" The peasant rolled the stone away, and out of the hole a great snake crawled, wound himself into a spiral, raised up his head, and said, ""Know, man, that I am Yaza! Get ready, you must die."" The peasant was terribly frightened, and lamenting he reproached the snake with ingratitude. ""Didn't you call for help? Haven't I saved your life?"" asked he. ""Of course,"" replied the snake, ""but I am only doing what I promised; I am paying you as the world pays best."" After a long discussion the snake agreed to let another settle the dispute, and they went together in search of a judge. After a while they came to where an old dog was tied to a fence. ""How are you, faithful guardian of a house?"" asked the peasant. ""As you see,"" replied the dog. ""Be so kind as to be our judge; we have a dispute."" And the peasant told the whole story. ""Wasn't it so and so?"" asked he, turning to the snake. ""It was,"" answered the snake. The dog thought a while, then said to the man, ""My friend, you must die, for this is just how the world pays best. When I was young I was my master's favorite. He wore the skins of the wolves and foxes which I caught; I guarded his house from thieves. My master was fond of me. When offered a carriage and horses he refused to sell me. But now, when I am old and weak and can neither run nor bark, he has led me out here and tied me to the fence to stay till some man kills me for my skin. This is the world's reward."" The peasant, seeing that he had lost his case, begged to look for another judge. The snake consented and they went through forests and across fields till they came to an old half-starved horse. His head was hanging down, his sides had fallen in, and he was covered with flies which he had not strength to drive away. ""How are you, noble beast?"" asked the peasant. ""As you see,"" replied the horse. The peasant told him the story and begged him to decide for them. The horse listened patiently to the man's complaint, then decided in favor of the snake, saying, ""This is the world's reward. ""When I was young,"" said he, ""I had every comfort. When I was led out of the stable every one admired me. I carried my master to war. More than once, by my swiftness, I saved his life and helped him to fame. Two men cared for me; they curried me twice each day and gave me the best of oats and hay. My stable was like a parlor. In summer they covered me with a net that flies might not bite me. My master wouldn't have sold me for a whole village. But when I grew old he starved me, didn't even give me straw to eat. And now he has led me out to this barren field to be killed by the wolves. This is how the world pays best."" ""What more do you want, man?"" asked the snake. The peasant begged the snake to let him try a third and last judge. He consented and they went on till at the edge of a forest they saw a fox, running along. ""Oh, Master Fox, wait and be our judge!"" called the peasant. ""We have a question to decide."" The fox, a cunning fellow, listened to the story, then winked to the peasant, and whispered, aside, ""If you will give me all of your hens I will help you out of your trouble."" ""What are hens!"" said the man. ""I will give you the geese too, and if need be all I have in the world."" The fox, pretending to be an impartial judge, said, ""This is an important case: one of life and death. The first who judged, judged lightly. In justice the case can only be decided on the spot where everything took place. We will go there."" When they came to the place, the fox said, ""We must begin at the beginning. Do you, man, sit down on the stone, and you, snake, crawl into the hole where you were lying."" When they had done as he told them, and the snake was back in the hole, he winked at the man, and said, ""Roll the stone over, quickly."" The peasant didn't wait to be told twice. When the hole was covered, and the snake couldn't get out, the peasant thanked the fox for salvation from death. The fox answered, ""But do not forget that I have earned the hens. Tomorrow before daylight, I will come for my breakfast."" The peasant went home as delighted as if he had been born a second time. He told his wife what had happened, praised the wisdom of the fox, and added that he had promised him all the hens, and that the next morning he would come for them. The woman was glad that her husband was saved, but she was very sorry to lose her hens. The next morning, early, she went to the window and seeing a fox in the yard she called to her husband, ""Do you hear, old man? There is a fox in the yard!"" ""Oh, that is the fox that saved me. He has come for the hens!"" ""Just as if I were crazy enough to give him my hens!"" cried the woman. ""The Lord be praised that you are alive; but take the gun and kill the fox. You will get good money for his pelt."" The peasant obeyed his wife. He took the gun and firing from the window killed the fox. Dying, the fox said in a mournful voice, ""This is how the world pays best.""",Russia,"Source: Jeremiah Curtin, Fairy Tales of Eastern Europe (New York: McBride, Nast and Company, 1914), pp. 24-28.",NA,NA
Ingratitude Is the World's Reward,0155,The Young Man and the Snake,"There was once a farmer who was extremely poor. It happened that when his poverty was greatest a son was born to him, and this son was such a lucky child that his father speedily became quite as rich as he was before poor, and obtained a great name over all the country. After a certain time the farmer thought to himself, ""I must get my son betrothed somewhere. I was poor once, but I am now rich, and my son is lucky. It is right that he should be betrothed to the daughter of some rich man like myself."" It was long before he found a suitable match, but at last he betrothed the boy to a girl who lived in a distant town. The ceremony came on, much money was spent, many guests were invited, and much food was given away. In short, the betrothal was splendid. The son had scarcely grown to manhood when the father died, leaving him in the world alone. The parents of his betrothed, when they heard the sad news, felt very sorry for him, and at first they would have brought him to live at their own house. But the mother said, ""He is old enough now to come and take our daughter home with him, so let us send for him that he may do so. No friend like a good wife."" A messenger was accordingly sent off, and the lad, when he received the invitation, dressed himself up in his best, and, mounting his mare, set off. On the way he came to a lonely jungle, in which he saw a mongoose and a snake of enormous dimensions, engaged in deadly combat. He reined up his horse to look on. The mongoose soon began to wear out his adversary, and to inflict such wounds as would have put an end to its life in a short time. Seeing which, the boy considered to himself, ""When two are contending, it is an act of charity to separate them."" So he tried to separate the combatants, but every time he failed, as the mongoose again and again sprang upon his adversary in spite of him. Finding he could not prevail, he drew his sword and dealt the warlike little mongoose his death-blow. After this he went on again, but he had not proceeded far when he found that the snake had rushed round and intercepted him. Then began the boy to remonstrate. ""I did you good service,"" said he. ""Why, then, have you pursued me?"" ""It is true,"" answered the snake, ""that you saved me from my enemy. But I shall not let you go. I shall eat you."" ""Surely,"" replied the lad, ""one good turn deserves another. Will you injure me because I assisted you? In my country we do not deal with each other thus."" ""In these parts,"" said the snake, ""the custom is different. Everyone here observes the rule of returning evil for good."" The boy then began to argue with the snake, but he argued in vain, for the snake was determined to eat him. At last he said, ""Very well, snake, you can eat me. But first give me eight days to go about my business, after which I shall come back."" With this request the snake complied, saying, ""Be it so. In eight days you must return to me."" The snake, which had coiled himself round about the boy's body, now released his hold and suffered him to depart. So he rode on once more and completed his journey. All his friends were very glad to see the young bridegroom, and especially his little wife, and at his father-in-law's house he remained for several days. But as he was always downcast and sad, they asked him, ""Why are you so sorrowful?"" For six days they asked in vain. On the seventh they spoke to their daughter, ""Is he angry? What is the matter with him"" But she also asked him in vain. When the eight day came, he said, ""Now let me go home."" The father and mother then gave the daughter her portion, and, having placed them both in a bullock cart, they sent the young couple away. So the two traveled until they had left the village far behind them. Then said the lad to his wife and to her servants, ""Return now back again to your own home. As for me, it is decreed that I shall die on the way."" All the servants, being alarmed, at once returned, but his young wife said, ""Where you fall, I shall fall. What am I to do at my house?"" So she continued to accompany her husband. When he arrived at the spot appointed, he dismounted from his horse and called forth the snake. ""I have come,"" said he, ""in accordance with my promise. If you wish to eat me, come and eat me now!"" His wife, hearing his ominous words, descended also, and came and stood by her husband's side. By and by a dreadful hissing sound was heard, and the snake crawled out from the jungle, and was preparing to devour the unfortunate boy, when the girl exclaimed, ""Why are you going to eat this poor youth?"" The snake then told her the whole story, how he was fighting with a mongoose, and how her husband interfered and killed his adversary. ""And in this country,"" continued he, ""our custom is to return evil for good!"" The young wife now tried all the arguments she could think of to divert the monster from his purpose, but he was deaf to her pleadings and refused to listen to them. Then said she, ""You say that in this country people do evil in return for good. This is so strange a custom, and so very unreasonable, that I would fain know the history of it. How did it all come about?"" ""Do you see those five talli trees?"" answered the snake. Go you to them and cry out to them, 'What is the reason that in this country folks do evil in return for good?' and see what they will say to you!"" The girl went and did as she was bidden, addressing her request to the middle of the five. The tree straightway answered her: Count us! We are now five, but once we were six -- three pairs. The sixth tree was hollow, having a vast cavity in its trunk. It happened once upon a time, many years ago, that a certain thief went and robbed a house, and that the people followed him. He ran and ran and ran, and at last he came in among us. It was night, but the moon was shining, and the thief hid himself in the hollow talli tree. Hearing his pursuers close at hand, he besought the tree, saying, ""O tree, tree, save me!"" When the talli tree heard his miserable cry it closed up its old sides upon him, and hid him in a safe embrace, so that the people searched for him in vain, and they had to return without him. When all pursuit was over, the tree once more opened and let him go. Now, in this old talli tree there was sandal wood, and the thief, when he went forth, had the scent of sandal wood so permanently fixed upon him that wherever he was, and wherever he appeared, he diffused a delightful fragrance. It so happened that he visited the city of a certain king, and a man passing him on the road suddenly stopped, and asked him, ""Where did you get this beautiful scent?"" ""You are mistaken,"" answered the thief. ""I have no scent."" ""If you will give me this scent,"" said the man, ""I will pay you its value."" Again the thief answered, ""I have no scent -- none."" Then the man, who was shrewd and intelligent, went his way to the king and told him, ""There is a stranger arrived here who possesses a most wonderful scent. To your highness, perhaps, he might be induced to give it up."" The king then ordered the thief into his presence, and said to him, ""Show me the scent you have."" ""I have none,"" said he. ""If you will give it up to me quietly,"" said the king, ""you shall be rewarded. If not, you shall be put to death."" When the thief heard this he got frightened and said, ""Do not kill me, and I will tell the whole story."" So he told the king how his life was preserved in the heart of the talli tree, and how the scent of sandal wood had never left him since. Then said the king, ""Come along and show me that wonderful tree of which you tell me."" Arriving at this very spot, the king instantly gave orders to his followers to cut the tree down and to carry it to his palace. But when the talli tree heard his order, and when it understood the reason of it, it cried aloud, ""I have saved the life of a man, and for this I am to lose my own life. For the future, therefore, let it be decreed within this jungle that whosoever dares to do good, to him it shall be repaid in evil!"" The girl, having heard this doleful story, returned once more to her husband's side. ""Well,"" said the snake, ""have you consulted the talli tree? And do you find that our custom here is even as I told you?"" She was compelled to admit that it was so. But as the monster advanced to his victim, she wept and said, ""What will become of me? If you must eat my husband, you must begin by eating me!"" The snake objected to an arrangement so unreasonable. ""You?"" cried he. ""But you have never done me the smallest good. You have not even done me harm. How, then, can I be expected to eat you?"" ""But if you kill my husband,"" replied she, ""what's left for me? You acknowledge yourself that I have done you no good, and yet you would inflict this injury upon me."" When the snake heard these words he stopped, and began to grow remorseful, especially as she wept more copiously than ever. That the boy must be eaten was certain, but how should he comfort the girl? Wishing to devise something, he crept back to his hole, and in a few minutes he returned with two magic globules or pills. ""Here, foolish woman,"" said he, ""take these two pills and swallow them, and you will have two sons to whom you can devote yourself, and who will take good care of you!"" The girl accepted the pills, but, with the cunning natural to a woman, said, ""If I take these two pills, doubtless two sons will be born. But what about my good name?"" The snake, who knew not that she was already wed, hearing her speech, became exasperated with her. ""Women are preposterous beings,"" cried he, and he crept back once more to his hole. This time he brought out two more pills, and when handing them to the disconsolate girl he said, ""Revenge will sweeten your lot. When any of your neighbors revile you on account of your sons, take one of these pills between finger and thumb, hold it over them, rubbing it gently so that some of the powder may fall on them, and immediately you will see them consume away to ashes."" Tying the former pills in her cloth, the girl looked at the other pills incredulously, and then, with a sudden thought, she gently rubbed them over the snake, saying with an innocent air, ""O snake, explain this mystery to me again! Is this the way I am to rub them?"" The moment an atom of the magic powder had touched the snake, he was set on fire, and in another instant he was merely a long wavy line of gray dust lying on the ground. Then with a glad face the little wife turned to her husband and said, ""Whosoever does good to anyone, in the end good will be done to him. And whosoever does evil to anyone, in the end evil will be done to him. You did good, and lo! you are rewarded. The snake did evil, and evil befell him. All things help each other. The Almighty brings everything to rights at last."" After this the two went on their way to their own home, where they lived in happiness and contentment for many a year.",Pakistan,"Source: Charles Swynnerton, Indian Nights' Entertainment: Folk-Tales from the Upper Indus (London: Elliot Stock, 1892), no. 42, pp. 133-38.",NA,NA
Jack and the Beanstalk,0328,Jack and the Bean-Pole,"So one day Jack climbed a bean-pole to get up to the top of the hill. So, when he had got to the top, he saw a palace, an' he went to this place to see who lived there. So, when he had got there, he found it was a giant's castle, but the giant wasn't at home. But his wife was. Jack was tired and hungry. So he asked the lady to take him in and give him something to eat. So she did so. But she told him not to let her husband catch him there. So, while Jack was eating, the giant came to the door. She told Jack to hide, an' Jack hid in the chest behind the door. So the giant came in. He said: So it wasn't very long till Jack made up his mind to make another trip back to the castle of the giant. So, when Jack went back this time, he tried to put on like another poor little boy that was half starved. So he begged entrance at the door of the castle from the wife. And she didn't want to have him in, and she told him about the boy that had took the wonder-box from her husband. So he begged so hard that she left him in, an' she gave him some bread and milk to eat. And again, while Jack was eating, the giant came. And as he came in the door, he said: His wife said, ""No, there hasn't been any one here today."" She says, ""I'm only roastin' some pork for your supper."" So, after he ate his supper, the giant sent for his golden hen that lay the golden egg. So his wife went and brought it for him. And while the giant was playing with the egg that the hen had laid, he fell fast asleep. An' Jack carried off the hen and the egg down the beanstalk to where his mother lived. But Jack still thought that he wanted to visit the castle again. So this time, when he went up the beanstalk to the giant's castle, he was in the appearance of a newsboy selling papers. So, while the wife went to get the money to buy a paper, the giant appeared, and Jack hid in the closet. And the giant repeated again: And after the giant had ate his supper, he called for his harp, the only thing that he had left, an' this was a magic harp. So it commenced to play, an' it played so sweetly that the giant fell fast asleep and commenced to snore. And as the harp stopped playing, Jack came out of the closet, took the harp, and started to the door. But the harp began to play, and it woke the giant up. An' the giant followed Jack out of the door, an' Jack run as fast as he could down the beanstalk, an' the giant started to follow. But as the giant reached the top, Jack cut down the beanstalk with an axe; an' as the giant stepped on, he fell down an' broke his neck. An' Jack and his mother always lived happy afterward with the property of the father which the giant had stolen an' Jack had restored again. Return to D. L.

Jack and the Beanstalk,0328,Jack and the Beanstalk,"There was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack, and a cow named Milky-White. And all they had to live on was the milk the cow gave every morning, which they carried to the market and sold. But one morning Milky-White gave no milk, and they didn't know what to do. ""What shall we do, what shall we do?"" said the widow, wringing her hands. ""Cheer up, mother, I'll go and get work somewhere,"" said Jack. ""We've tried that before, and nobody would take you,"" said his mother. ""We must sell Milky-White and with the money start a shop, or something."" ""All right, mother,"" says Jack. ""It's market day today, and I'll soon sell Milky-White, and then we'll see what we can do."" So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he started. He hadn't gone far when he met a funny-looking old man, who said to him, ""Good morning, Jack."" ""Good morning to you,"" said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name. ""Well, Jack, and where are you off to?"" said the man. ""I'm going to market to sell our cow there."" ""Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows,"" said the man. ""I wonder if you know how many beans make five."" ""Two in each hand and one in your mouth,"" says Jack, as sharp as a needle. ""Right you are,"" says the man, ""and here they are, the very beans themselves,"" he went on, pulling out of his pocket a number of strange-looking beans. ""As you are so sharp,"" says he, ""I don't mind doing a swap with you -- your cow for these beans."" ""Go along,"" says Jack. ""Wouldn't you like it?"" ""Ah! You don't know what these beans are,"" said the man. ""If you plant them overnight, by morning they grow right up to the sky."" ""Really?"" said Jack. ""You don't say so."" ""Yes, that is so. And if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have your cow back."" ""Right,"" says Jack, and hands him over Milky-White's halter and pockets the beans. Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by the time he got to his door. ""Back already, Jack?"" said his mother. ""I see you haven't got Milky-White, so you've sold her. How much did you get for her?"" ""You'll never guess, mother,"" says Jack. ""No, you don't say so. Good boy! Five pounds? Ten? Fifteen? No, it can't be twenty."" ""I told you you couldn't guess. What do you say to these beans? They're magical. Plant them overnight and -- "" ""What!"" says Jack's mother. ""Have you been such a fool, such a dolt, such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-White, the best milker in the parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans? Take that! Take that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out of the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink, and not a bit shall you swallow this very night."" So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake as for the loss of his supper. At last he dropped off to sleep. When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was shining into part of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady. So Jack jumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you think he saw? Why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all. The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to do was to open it and give a jump onto the beanstalk which ran up just like a big ladder. So Jack climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till at last he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart. So he walked along, and he walked along, and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman. ""Good morning, mum,"" says Jack, quite polite-like. ""Could you be so kind as to give me some breakfast?"" For he hadn't had anything to eat, you know, the night before, and was as hungry as a hunter. ""It's breakfast you want, is it?"" says the great big tall woman. ""It's breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here. My man is an ogre and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast. You'd better be moving on or he'll be coming."" ""Oh! please, mum, do give me something to eat, mum. I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,"" says Jack. ""I may as well be broiled as die of hunger."" Well, the ogre's wife was not half so bad after all. So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a hunk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk. But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump! thump! thump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming. ""Goodness gracious me! It's my old man,"" said the ogre's wife. ""What on earth shall I do? Come along quick and jump in here."" And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in. He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he had three calves strung up by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said, ""Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah! what's this I smell? ""Nonsense, dear,"" said his wife. ""You' re dreaming. Or perhaps you smell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner. Here, you go and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you come back your breakfast'll be ready for you."" So off the ogre went, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven and run away when the woman told him not. ""Wait till he's asleep,"" says she; ""he always has a doze after breakfast."" Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out a couple of bags of gold, and down he sits and counts till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole house shook again. Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre, he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold, which, of course, fell into his mother's garden, and then he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said, ""Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans? They are really magical, you see."" So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to the end of it, and Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he rose up early, and got onto the beanstalk, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till at last he came out onto the road again and up to the great tall house he had been to before. There, sure enough, was the great tall woman a-standing on the doorstep. ""Good morning, mum,"" says Jack, as bold as brass, ""could you be so good as to give me something to eat?"" ""Go away, my boy,"" said the big tall woman, ""or else my man will eat you up for breakfast. But aren't you the youngster who came here once before? Do you know, that very day my man missed one of his bags of gold."" ""That's strange, mum,"" said Jack, ""I dare say I could tell you something about that, but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat."" Well, the big tall woman was so curious that she took him in and gave him something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he could when thump! thump! they heard the giant's footstep, and his wife hid Jack away in the oven. All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before, said, ""Fee-fi-fo-fum,"" and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen. Then he said, ""Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs."" So she brought it, and the ogre said, ""Lay,"" and it laid an egg all of gold. And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook. Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say ""Jack Robinson."" But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he heard him calling, ""Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?"" And the wife said, ""Why, my dear?"" But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire. And when he got home he showed his mother the wonderful hen, and said ""Lay"" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said ""Lay."" Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he rose up early and got to the beanstalk, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed, and he climbed till he got to the top. But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house. And when he got near it, he waited behind a bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper. He hadn't been there long when he heard thump! thump! thump! as before, and in came the ogre and his wife. ""Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,"" cried out the ogre. ""I smell him, wife, I smell him."" ""Do you, my dearie?"" says the ogre's wife. ""Then, if it's that little rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's sure to have got into the oven."" And they both rushed to the oven. But Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre' s wife said, ""There you are again with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why, of course, it's the boy you caught last night that I've just broiled for your breakfast. How forgetful I am, and how careless you are not to know the difference between live and dead after all these years."" So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and then he would mutter, ""Well, I could have sworn --"" and he'd get up and search the larder and the cupboards and everything, only, luckily, he didn't think of the copper. After breakfast was over, the ogre called out, ""Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp."" So she brought it and put it on the table before him. Then he said, ""Sing!"" and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder. Then Jack lifted up the copper lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door. But the harp called out quite loud, ""Master! Master!"" and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp. Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him, only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear like, and when he came to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start. But just then the harp cried out, ""Master! Master!"" and the ogre swung himself down onto the beanstalk, which shook with his weight. Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre. By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home. So he called out, ""Mother! Mother! bring me an ax, bring me an ax."" And his mother came rushing out with the ax in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright, for there she saw the ogre with his legs just through the clouds. But Jack jumped down and got hold of the ax and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two. The ogre felt the beanstalk shake and quiver, so he stopped to see what was the matter. Then Jack gave another chop with the ax, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after. Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing that and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his mother became very rich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever after. Once upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son Jack. Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind hearted and affectionate. There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague. Jack did no work as yet, and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor. The widow saw that there was no means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow; so one morning she said to her son, ""I am too weak to go myself, Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."" Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for these beans. When he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears, scolding Jack for his folly. He was very sorry, and mother and son went to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone. At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden. ""At least,"" he thought, ""I will sow the wonderful beans. Mother says that they are just common scarlet runners, and nothing else; but I may as well sow them."" So he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and put in the beans. That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowing that for the next day there would be none, and Jack, unable to sleep from grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into the garden. What was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in the night, and climbed up and up until they covered the high cliff that sheltered the cottage and disappeared above it! The stalks had twined and twisted themselves together until they formed quite a ladder. ""It would be easy to climb it,"" thought Jack. And, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry it out, for Jack was a good climber. However, after his late mistake about the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first. So Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the beanstalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to bear Jack's weight. ""I wonder where it ends,"" said Jack to his mother. ""I think I will climb up and see."" His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the beanstalk; so at last she yielded to his wishes. Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like beanstalk until everything he had left behind him -- the cottage, the village, and even the tall church tower -- looked quite little, and still he could not see the top of the beanstalk. Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up. So after resting for a moment he went on. After climbing higher and higher, until he grew afraid to look down for fear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the beanstalk, and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautiful meadows covered with sheep. A crystal stream ran through the pastures; not far from the place where he had got off the beanstalk stood a fine, strong castle. Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land. While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange looking woman came out of the wood, and advanced towards him. She wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine. Her hair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff. Jack took off his cap and made her a bow. ""If you please, ma'am,"" said he, ""is this your house?"" ""No,"" said the old lady. ""Listen, and I will tell you the story of that castle:"" Jack uttered a cry of surprise. ""My mother! Oh, madam, what ought I to do? My poor father! My dear mother!"" ""Your duty requires you to win it back for your mother. But the task is a very difficult one, and full of peril, Jack. Have you courage to undertake it?"" ""I fear nothing when I am doing right,"" said Jack. ""Then,"" said the lady in the red cap, ""you are one of those who slay giants. You must get into the castle, and if possible possess yourself of a hen that lays golden eggs, and a harp that talks. Remember, all the giant possesses is really yours."" As she ceased speaking, the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared, and of course Jack knew she was a fairy. Jack determined at once to attempt the adventure; so he advanced, and blew the horn which hung at the castle portal. The door was opened in a minute or two by a frightful giantess, with one great eye in the middle of her forehead. As soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, and dragged him into the castle. ""Ho, ho!"" she laughed terribly. ""You didn't expect to see me here, that is clear! No, I shan't let you go again. I am weary of my life. I am so overworked, and I don't see why I should not have a page as well as other ladies. And you shall be my boy. You shall clean the knives, and black the boots, and make the fires, and help me generally when the giant is out. When he is at home I must hide you, for he has eaten up all my pages hitherto, and you would be a dainty morsel, my little lad."" While she spoke she dragged Jack right into the castle. The poor boy was very much frightened, as I am sure you and I would have been in his place. But he remembered that fear disgraces a man, so he struggled to be brave and make the best of things. ""I am quite ready to help you, and do all I can to serve you, madam,"" he said, ""only I beg you will be good enough to hide me from your husband, for I should not like to be eaten at all."" ""That's a good boy,"" said the giantess, nodding her head; ""it is lucky for you that you did not scream out when you saw me, as the other boys who have been here did, for if you had done so my husband would have awakened and have eaten you, as he did them, for breakfast. Come here, child; go into my wardrobe. He never ventures to open that. You will be safe there."" And she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall, and shut him into it. But the keyhole was so large that it admitted plenty of air, and he could see everything that took place through it. By and by he heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of a great cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out. ""Wife,"" cried the giant, ""there is a man in the castle. Let me have him for breakfast."" ""You are grown old and stupid,"" cried the lady in her loud tones. ""It is only a nice fresh steak off an elephant that I have cooked for you which you smell. There, sit down and make a good breakfast."" And she placed a huge dish before him of savory steaming meat, which greatly pleased him and made him forget his idea of an Englishman being in the castle. When he had breakfasted he went out for a walk; and then the giantess opened the door, and made Jack come out to help her. He helped her all day. She fed him well, and when evening came put him back in the wardrobe. The giant came in to supper. Jack watched him through the keyhole, and was amazed to see him pick a wolf's bone and put half a fowl at a time into his capacious mouth. When the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laid the golden eggs. ""It lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight,"" he said. ""Indeed, I think the eggs are heavier than ever."" The giantess went away, and soon returned with a little brown hen, which she placed on the table before her husband. ""And now, my dear,"" she said, ""I am going for a walk, if you don't want me any longer."" ""Go,"" said the giant. ""I shall be glad to have a nap by and by."" Then he took up the brown hen and said to her, ""Lay!"" And she instantly laid a golden egg. ""Lay!"" said the giant again. And she laid another. ""Lay!"" he repeated the third time. And again a golden egg lay on the table. Now Jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken. By and by the giant put the hen down on the floor, and soon after went fast asleep, snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder. Directly Jack perceived that the giant was fast asleep, he pushed open the door of the wardrobe and crept out. Very softly he stole across the room, and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment. He knew the way to the kitchen, the door of which he found was left ajar. He opened it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to the beanstalk, which he descended as fast as his feet would move. When his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy, for she had feared that the fairies had carried him away, or that the giant had found him. But Jack put the brown hen down before her, and told her how he had been in the giant's castle, and all his adventures. She was very glad to see the hen, which would make them rich once more. Jack made another journey up the beanstalk to the giant's castle one day while his mother had gone to market. But first he dyed his hair and disguised himself. The old woman did not know him again and dragged him in as she had done before to help her to do the work; but she heard her husband coming, and hid him in the wardrobe, not thinking that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen. She bade him stay quite still there, or the giant would eat him. Then the giant came in saying: ""Nonsense!"" said the wife, ""it is only a roasted bullock that I thought would be a tit-bit for your supper; sit down and I will bring it up at once."" The giant sat down, and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on a large dish, and they began their supper. Jack was amazed to see them pick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark. As soon as they had finished their meal, the giantess rose and said:, ""Now, my dear, with your leave I am going up to my room to finish the story I am reading. If you want me call for me."" ""First,"" answered the giant, ""bring me my money bags, that I may count my golden pieces before I sleep."" The giantess obeyed. She went and soon returned with two large bags over her shoulders, which she put down by her husband. ""There,"" she said; ""that is all that is left of the knight's money. When you have spent it you must go and take another baron's castle."" ""That he shan't, if I can help it,"" thought Jack. The giant, when his wife was gone, took out heaps and heaps of golden pieces, and counted them, and put them in piles, until he was tired of the amusement. Then he swept them all back into their bags, and leaning back in his chair fell fast asleep, snoring so loud that no other sound was audible. Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and taking up the bags of money (which were his very own, because the giant had stolen them from his father), he ran off, and with great difficulty descending the beanstalk, laid the bags of gold on his mother's table. She had just returned from town, and was crying at not finding Jack. ""There, mother, I have brought you the gold that my father lost."" ""Oh, Jack! You are a very good boy, but I wish you would not risk your precious life in the giant's castle. Tell me how you came to go there again."" And Jack told her all about it. Jack's mother was very glad to get the money, but she did not like him to run any risk for her. But after a time Jack made up his mind to go again to the giant's castle. So he climbed the beanstalk once more, and blew the horn at the giant's gate. The giantess soon opened the door. She was very stupid, and did not know him again, but she stopped a minute before she took him in. She feared another robbery; but Jack's fresh face looked so innocent that she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in, and again hid him away in the wardrobe. By and by the giant came home, and as soon as he had crossed the threshold he roared out: ""You stupid old giant,"" said his wife, ""you only smell a nice sheep, which I have grilled for your dinner."" And the giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for his dinner. When he had eaten it all up, he said, ""Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you take your walk."" The giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp. The framework was all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all of gold. ""This is one of the nicest things I took from the knight,"" said the giant. ""I am very fond of music, and my harp is a faithful servant."" So he drew the harp towards him, and said, ""Play!"" And the harp played a very soft, sad air. ""Play something merrier!"" said the giant. And the harp played a merry tune. ""Now play me a lullaby,"" roared the giant, and the harp played a sweet lullaby, to the sound of which its master fell asleep. Then Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and went into the huge kitchen to see if the giantess had gone out. He found no one there, so he went to the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could not do so with the harp in his hand. Then he entered the giant's room and seized the harp and ran away with it; but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called out, ""Master! Master!"" And the giant woke up. With a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat, and in two strides had reached the door. But Jack was very nimble. He fled like lightning with the harp, talking to it as he went (for he saw it was a fairy), and telling it he was the son of its old master, the knight. Still the giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor Jack, and had stretched out his great hand to catch him. But, luckily, just at the moment he stepped upon a loose stone, stumbled, and fell flat on the ground, where he lay at his full length. This accident gave Jack time to get on the beanstalk and hasten down it; but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the giant descending after him. ""Mother! mother!"" cried Jack, ""make haste and give me the ax."" His mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand, and Jack with one tremendous blow cut through all the stems except one. ""Now, mother, stand out of the way!"" said he. Jack's mother shrank back, and it was well she did so, for just as the giant took hold of the last branch of the beanstalk, Jack cut the stem quite through and darted from the spot. Down came the giant with a terrible crash, and as he fell on his head, he broke his neck, and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so much injured. Before Jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm and agitation, a beautiful lady stood before them. ""Jack,"" said she, ""you have acted like a brave knight's son, and deserve to have your inheritance restored to you. Dig a grave and bury the giant, and then go and kill the giantess."" ""But,"" said Jack, ""I could not kill anyone unless I were fighting with him; and I could not draw my sword upon a woman. Moreover, the giantess was very kind to me."" The fairy smiled on Jack. ""I am very much pleased with your generous feeling,"" she said. ""Nevertheless, return to the castle, and act as you will find needful."" Jack asked the fairy if she would show him the way to the castle, as the beanstalk was now down. She told him that she would drive him there in her chariot, which was drawn by two peacocks. Jack thanked her, and sat down in the chariot with her. The fairy drove him a long distance round, until they reached a village which lay at the bottom of the hill. Here they found a number of miserable-looking men assembled. The fairy stopped her carriage and addressed them. ""My friends,"" said she, ""the cruel giant who oppressed you and ate up all your flocks and herds is dead, and this young gentleman was the means of your being delivered from him, and is the son of your kind old master, the knight."" The men gave a loud cheer at these words, and pressed forward to say that they would serve Jack as faithfully as they had served his father. The fairy bade them follow her to the castle, and they marched thither in a body, and Jack blew the horn and demanded admittance. The old giantess saw them coming from the turret loop hole. She was very much frightened, for she guessed that something had happened to her husband; and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her foot in her dress, and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck. When the people outside found that the door was not opened to them, they took crowbars and forced the portal. Nobody was to be seen, but on leaving the hall they found the body of the giantess at the foot of the stairs. Thus Jack took possession of the castle. The fairy went and brought his mother to him, with the hen and the harp. He had the giantess buried, and endeavored as much as lay in his power to do right to those whom the giant had robbed. Before her departure for fairyland, the fairy explained to Jack that she had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans, in order to try what sort of lad he was. ""If you had looked at the gigantic beanstalk and only stupidly wondered about it,"" she said, ""I should have left you where misfortune had placed you, only restoring her cow to your mother. But you showed an inquiring mind, and great courage and enterprise, therefore you deserve to rise; and when you mounted the beanstalk you climbed the Ladder of Fortune."" She then took her leave of Jack and his mother. There lived a poor widow, whose cottage stood in a country village a long distance from London, for many years. The widow had only a child named Jack, whom she gratified in everything. The consequence of her partiality was that Jack paid little attention to anything she said, and he was heedless and extravagant. His follies were not owing to bad disposition but to his mother never having chided him. As she was not wealthy, and he would not work, she was obliged to support herself and him by selling everything she had. At last nothing remained, only a cow. The widow, with tears in her eyes, could not help reproaching Jack. ""Oh! You wicked boy,"" said she. ""By your prodigal course of life you have now brought us both to fall! Heedless, heedless boy! I have not money enough to buy a bit of bread for another day. Nothing remains but my poor cow, and that must be sold, or we must starve!"" Jack was in a degree of tenderness for a few minutes, but soon over. And then becoming very hungry for want of food, he teased his poor mother to let him sell the cow, to which at last she reluctantly consented. As he proceeded on his journey he met a butcher, who inquired why he was driving the cow from home. Jack replied he was going to sell it. The butcher had some wonderful beans of different colors in his bag which attracted Jack's notice. This the butcher saw, who, knowing Jack's easy temper, resolved to take advantage of it, and offered all the beans for the cow. The foolish boy thought it a great offer. The bargain was momently struck, and the cow exchanged for a few paltry beans. When Jack hastened home with the beans and told his mother, and showed them to her, she kicked the beans away in a great passion. They flew in all directions, and were extended as far as the garden. Early in the morning Jack arose from his bed, and seeing something strange from the window, he hastened downstairs into the garden, where he soon found that some of the beans had grown in root and sprung up wonderfully. The stalks grew in an immense thickness and had so entwined that they formed a ladder like a chain in view. Looking upwards, he could not descry the top. It seemed to be lost in the clouds. He tried it, discovered it firm and not to be shaken. A new idea immediately struck him. He would climb the beanstalk and see to whence it would lead. Full of this plan, which made him forget even his hunger, Jack hastened to communicate his intention to his mother. He instantly set out, and after climbing for some hours reached the top of the beanstalk, fatigued and almost exhausted. Looking round, he was surprised to find himself in a strange country. It looked to be quite a barren desert. Not a tree, shrub, house, or living creature was to be seen. Jack sat himself pensively upon a block of stone and thought of his mother. His hunger attacked him, and now he appeared sorrowful for his disobedience in climbing the beanstalk against her will, and concluded that he must now die for want of food. However, he walked on, hoping to see a house where he might beg something to eat. Suddenly he observed a beautiful young female at some distance. She was dressed in an elegant manner, and had a small white wand in her hand, on the top of which was a peacock of pure gold. She approached and said, ""I will reveal to you a story your mother dare not. But before I begin, I require a solemn promise on your part to do what I command. I am a fairy, and unless you perform exactly what I direct you to do, you will deprive me of the power to assist you, and there is little doubt but that you will die in the attempt."" Jack was rather frightened at this caution, but promised to follow her directions. As soon as she had concluded she disappeared, leaving Jack to follow his journey. He walked on till after sunset, when to his great joy he espied a large mansion. This pleasant sight revived his drooping spirits. He redoubled his speed and reached it shortly. A well-looking woman stood at the door. He accosted her, begging she would give him a morsel of bread and a night's lodging. She expressed the greatest surprise at seeing him and said it was quite uncommon to see any strange creature near their house, for it was mostly known that her husband was a very cruel and powerful giant, and one that would eat human flesh if he could possibly get it. This account terrified Jack greatly, but still, not forgetting the fairy's protection, he hoped to elude the giant, and therefore he entreated the woman to take him in for one night only and hide him where she thought proper. The good woman at last suffered herself to be persuaded, for her disposition was remarkably compassionate, and at last led him into the house. First they passed an elegant hall, finely furnished. They then proceeded through several spacious rooms, all in the same style of grandeur, but they looked to be quite forsaken and desolate. A long gallery came next. It was very dark, just large enough to show that instead of a wall on each side there was a grating of iron, which parted off a dismal dungeon, for whence issued the groans of several poor victims whom the cruel giant reserved in confinement for his voracious appetite. Poor Jack was in a dreadful fright at witnessing such a horrible scene, which caused him to fear that he would never see his mother, but be captured lastly for the giant's meat. But still he recollected the fairy, and a gleam of hope forced itself into his heart. The good woman then took Jack to a spacious kitchen, where a great fire was kept. She bade him sit down and gave him plenty to eat and drink. In the meantime he had done his meal and enjoyed himself, but was disturbed by a hard knocking at the gate, so loud as to cause the house to shake. Jack was concealed in the oven, and the giant's wife ran to let in her husband. Jack heard him accost her in a voice like thunder, saying, ""Wife! Wife! I smell fresh meat!"" ""Oh! My dear,"" replied she, ""it is nothing but the people in the dungeon."" The giant seemed to believe her, and at last seated himself by the fireside, whilst the wife prepared supper. By degrees Jack endeavored to look at the monster through a small crevice. He was much surprised to see what an amazing quantity he devoured, and supposed he would never have done eating and drinking. After his supper was ended a very curious hen was brought and placed on the table before him. Jack's curiosity was so great to see what would happen. He observed that it stood quiet before him, and every time the giant said, ""Lay!"" the hen laid an egg of solid gold. The giant amused himself a long time with his hen. Meanwhile his wife went to bed At length he fell asleep and snored like the roaring of a cannon. Jack, finding him still asleep at daybreak, crept softly from his hiding place, seized the hen, and ran off with her as fast as his legs could possibly allow him. Jack easily retraced his way to the beanstalk and descended it better quicker than he expected. His mother was overjoyed to see him. ""Now, mother,"" said Jack, ""I have brought you home that which will make you rich."" The hen produced as many golden eggs as they desired. They sold them and soon became possessed of as much riches as they wanted. For a few months Jack and his mother lived very happy, but he longed to pay the giant another visit. Early in the morning he again climbed the beanstalk and reached the giant's mansion late in the evening. The woman was at the door as before. Jack told her a pitiful tale and prayed for a night's shelter. She told him that she had admitted a poor hungry boy once before, and the little ingrate had stolen one of the giant's treasures, and ever since that she had been cruelly used. She, however, led him to the kitchen, gave him supper, and put him in a lumber closet. Soon after, the giant came in, took his supper, and ordered his wife to bring down his bags of gold and silver. Jack peeped out of his hiding place and observed the giant counting over his treasures, and after which he carefully put them in bags again, fell asleep, and snored as before. Jack crept quietly from his hiding place and approached the giant, when a little dog under the chair barked furiously. Contrary to his expectation, the giant slept on soundly, and the dog ceased. Jack seized the bags, reached the door in safety, and soon arrived at the bottom of the beanstalk. When he reached his mother's cottage he found it quite deserted. Greatly surprised, he ran into the village, and an old woman directed him to a house, where he found his mother apparently dying. On being informed of our hero's safe return, his mother revived and soon recovered. Jack then presented two bags of gold and silver to her. Her mother discovered that something preyed upon his mind heavily and endeavored to discover the cause, but Jack knew too well what the consequence would be should he discover the cause of his melancholy to her. He did his utmost therefore to conquer the great desire which now forced itself upon him in spite of himself for another journey up the beanstalk. On the longest day Jack arose as soon as it was light, ascended the beanstalk and reached the top with some little trouble. He found the road, journey, etc., the same as on the former occasions. He arrived at the giant's house in the evening and found his wife standing as usual at the door. Jack now appeared a different character, and had disguised himself so completely that she did not appear to have any recollection of him. However, when he begged admittance, he found it very difficult to persuade her. At last he prevailed, was allowed to go in, and was concealed in the copper. When the giant returned, he said, as usual, ""Wife! Wife! I smell fresh meat!"" But Jack felt quite composed, as he had said so before, and had soon been satisfied. However, the giant started up suddenly, and notwithstanding all his wife could say, he searched all round the room. Whilst this was going forward, Jack was much terrified, and ready to die with fear, wishing himself at home a thousand times. But when the giant approached the copper and put his hand upon the lid, Jack thought his death was certain. Fortunately the giant ended his search there without moving the lid, and seated himself quietly by the fireside. When the giant's supper was over he commanded his wife to fetch down his harp. Jack peeped under the copper lid, and soon saw the most beautiful one that could be imagined. It was put by the giant on the table, who said, ""Play,"" and it instantly played of its own accord. The music was uncommonly fine. Jack was delighted and felt more anxious to get the harp into his possession than either of the former treasures. The giant's soul was not attuned to harmony, and the music soon lulled him into a sound sleep. Now, therefore, was the time to carry off the harp, as the giant appeared to be in a more profound sleep than usual. Jack soon made up his mind, got out of the copper, and seized the harp, which, however, being enchanted by a fairy, called out loudly, ""Master, master!"" The giant awoke, stood up, and tried to pursue Jack, but he had drank so much that he could not stand. Jack ran as quick as he could. In a little time the giant recovered sufficiently to walk slowly, or rather to reel after him. Had he been sober, he must have overtaken Jack instantly. But as he then was, Jack contrived to be first at the top of the beanstalk. The giant called to him all the way along the road in a voice like thunder, and was sometimes very near to him.

Just at that instant the giant began to descend, but Jack with his hatchet cut the beanstalk close off at the root, and the giant fell headlong into the garden. The fall instantly killed him.

The Jackal and the Farmer,0154,The Jackal and the Farmer,"The farmer was terrified. He unhitched one of the oxen and gave it to the lion. The lion took it and dragged it away. The farmer went home with the remaining ox and bought a second one that same evening so that the next day he would be able to plow again. The next day the farmer plowed again from morning morning until evening, and when it was evening the lion came again and said, ""Farmer, give me one of your two oxen or I'll kill both of them and you as well."" Again the farmer gave him an ox. That evening he bought another ox so that he would be able to plow again the next day. The next evening the lion came again and demanded an ox. The farmer gave the lion an ox every evening. One evening the jackal came by as the farmer was driving his single ox home. The jackal said, ""Every morning I see you leave the farmyard with two oxen and every evening I see you coming back with only one. Why is that?"" The farmer said, ""Every evening when I am finished with the day's work the lion comes and demands one of my oxen and threatens to kill me and both oxen if I don't grant his wish."" The jackal said, ""If you promise to give me a sheep I will free you from the lion."" The farmer answered, ""If you can free me from the lion I will gladly promise you a sheep."" The jackal said, ""Tomorrow I will call out with a disguised voice from up there on the hill and ask who is speaking with you. Then you answer that it is only an Asko (a block of wood to be split). Have a hatchet at hand. Do you understand me?"" The farmer said, ""Certainly, I understand you."" The next day the farmer took a hatchet with him to the field and plowed as usual with the two oxen from morning till eve. When it was evening the lion came and said, ""Farmer, give me an ox or I shall kill both oxen and you as well."" When the lion had said that a deep voice spoke from the hill and said, ""Farmer, who is talking with you?"" The lion was afraid, ducked down, and said in a frightened voice, ""That is god."" But the farmer replied loudly, ""It is only an Asko."" The voice answered loudly, ""Then take your hatchet and split the block of wood."" The lion said softly, ""Just hit me gently, farmer,"" and with that he bowed his head. The farmer gripped his hatchet and struck at the lion's skull with all his force so that he split it, and the lion died at once. The jackal came down from the hill and said, ""I have done what I promised. The lion is finished. Tomorrow I will come again to fetch the sheep that you promised me."" The farmer said, ""You shall have it."" The farmer came home. He said to his wife, ""The jackal has freed me from the lion. Now I will give him a ram. I will kill it. You pack it up so that I can take it with me to the field tomorrow."" The man killed the ram. As his wife was packing it up she said, ""Why shouldn't we eat the good ram ourselves?"" She put the ram into a leather sack. She laid the leather sack in a wicker basket. But she had their dog to lie down in the basket beside the leather sack. She said to the farmer, ""If the jackal does not take the ram during the day, then bring it home again. Otherwise the animals that have done nothing for you will eat it during the night. Set the basket down in the field just as it is and then let happen what will."" The farmer went to the field. He put the basket down on the field and shouted, ""Jackal here is your ram!"" Then he went to work, plowing from morning until evening without further concerning himself about the basket, the ram, or the jackal. However, the jackal approached the basket in order to get the ram. When he stuck his nose into the basket the dog leaped up. The jackal ran away as fast as he could. The dog ran after him for a while but seeing that the jackal was too fast, he gave up and ran home. The jackal swore never to help men again. In the evening the farmer came. He looked into the basket and found the ram still untouched. So he picked up the basket again with the ram in it, brought it home, and said, ""The jackal has not called for his ram. Now we can eat it ourselves!""",North Africa (Kabyl),"Source: Leo Frobenius, ""Der Schakal und der Bauer,"" Volksmärchen der Kabylen, Band 3: Das Fabelhafte (Jena: Eugen Diederichs, 1921), no. 7, pp. 24-26.",Translated by D.

The Jackal and the Farmer,0154,Well Done and Ill Paid,"Once on a time there was a man, who had to drive his sledge to the wood for fuel. So a bear met him. ""Out with your horse,"" said the bear, ""or I'll strike all your sheep dead by summer."" ""Oh! heaven help me then,"" said the man. ""There's not a stick of firewood in the house. You must let me drive home a load of fuel, else we shall be frozen to death. I'll bring the horse to you tomorrow morning."" Yes, on those terms he might drive the wood home. That was a bargain. But Bruin said if he didn't come back, he should lose all his sheep by summer. So the man got the wood on the sledge and rattled homewards, but he wasn't over pleased at the bargain you may fancy. So just then a fox met him. ""Why, what's the matter?"" said the fox. ""Why are you so down in the mouth?"" ""Oh, if you want to know,"" said the man, ""I met a bear up yonder in the wood, and I had to give my word to him to bring Dobbin back tomorrow, at this very hour; for if he didn't get him, he said he would tear all my sheep to death by summer."" ""Stuff, nothing worse than that,"" said the fox. ""If you'll give me your fattest wether, I'll soon set you free. See if I don't."" Yes, the man gave his word, and swore he would keep it too. ""Well, when you come with Dobbin tomorrow for the bear,"" said the fox, ""I'll make a clatter up in that heap of stones yonder, and so when the bear asks what that noise is, you must say 'tis Peter the Marksman, who is the best shot in the world. And after that you must help yourself."" Next day off set the man, and when he met the bear, something began to make a clatter up in the heap of stones. ""Hist! What's that?"" said the bear. ""Oh! that's Peter the Marksman, to be sure,"" said the man. ""He's the best shot in the world. I know him by his voice."" ""Have you seen any bears about here, Eric?"" shouted out a voice in the wood. ""Say No!"" said the bear. ""No, I haven't seen any,"" said Eric. ""What's that then that stands alongside your sledge?"" bawled out the voice in the wood. ""Say it's an old fir stump,"" said the bear. ""Oh, it's only an old fir stump,"" said the man. ""Such fir stumps we take in our country and roll them on our sledges,"" bawled out the voice. ""If you can't do it yourself, I'll come and help you."" ""Say you can help yourself, and roll me up on the sledge,"" said the bear. ""No, thank ye, I can help myself well enough,"" said the man, and rolled the bear onto the sledge. ""Such fir stumps we always bind fast on our sledges in our part of the world,"" bawled out the voice. ""Shall I come and help you?"" ""Say you can help yourself, and bind me fast, do."" said the bear. ""No, thanks, I can help myself well enough,"" said the man, who set to binding Bruin fast with all the ropes he had, so that at last the bear couldn't stir a paw. ""Such fir stumps we always drive our axes into in our part of the world,"" bawled out the voice, ""for then we guide them better going down the steep pitches."" ""Pretend to drive your axe into me, do now,"" said the bear. Then the man took up his axe, and at one blow split the bear's skull, so that Bruin lay dead in a trice, and so the man and the fox were great friends, and on the best terms. But when they came near the farm, the fox said, ""I've no mind to go right home with you, for I can't say I like your tykes, so I'll just wait here, and you can bring the wether to me, but mind and pick out one nice and fat."" Yes, the man would be sure to do that, and thanked the fox much for his help. So when he had put up Dobbin, he went across to the sheep stall. ""Whither away, now?"" asked his old dame. ""Oh!"" said the man, ""I'm only going to the sheep stall to fetch a fat wether for that cunning fox who set our Dobbin free. I gave him my word I would."" ""Wether, indeed,"" said the old dame. ""Never a one shall that thief of a fox get. Haven't we got Dobbin safe and the bear into the bargain. And as for the fox, I'll be bound he's stolen more of our geese than the wether is worth. And even if he hasn't stolen them, he will. No, no; take a brace of your swiftest hounds in a sack, and slip them loose after him. And then, perhaps, we shall be rid of this robbing Reynard."" Well, the man thought that good advice; so he took two fleet red hounds, put them into a sack, and set off with them. ""Have you brought the wether?"" said the fox. ""Yes, come and take it,"" said the man, as he untied the sack and let slip the hounds. "" Huff!"" said the fox, and gave a great spring. ""True it is what the old saw says, 'Well done is often ill paid.' And now, too, I see the truth of another saying, 'The worst foes are those of one's own house.'"" That was what the fox said as he ran off, and saw the red fox hounds at his heels.",Norway,"Source: Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, Vel gjort og ille lønnet, Norske Folkeeventyr.

The Language of Animals,0670,Frederigo da Pozzuolo Is Pressed by His Wife to Tell a Secret,"It is the duty of all wise and prudent men to hold their wives in due fear and subjection, and on no account to be induced by them to wear their breeches as head gear. If indeed they should be led to follow other courses than these, they will of a surety have good cause to repent in the end. It happened one day that Federigo da Pozzuolo, a young man of great parts and prudence, was riding towards Naples on a mare of his which was in foal, carrying behind him on the crupper his wife, who was also pregnant. Likewise there was a young colt which followed the mare its mother, and, having been left some distance behind on the road, it began to neigh, and to cry out in its own language, ""Mother, mother, go slowly, I pray you; because I, being very young and tender, and only just a year old, am not able in my pace to follow in your footsteps."" Hearing this the mare pricked up her ears, and, sniffing the air with her nostrils, began also to neigh loudly, and said in answer to her colt, ""I have to carry my mistress, who is with child, and in addition to this I bear a young brother of yours in my womb; while you, who are young and brisk, carry no burden of any sort strapped on your back, and yet you declare that you cannot travel. Come on, if you wish to come; but if not, go and do whatever pleases you."" The young man, when he understood the meaning of these words (for be it known he was well skilled in the utterances of birds and of all the animals that live on earth), smiled somewhat; whereupon his wife, who was greatly filled with wonder thereanent, questioned him as to the reason why he smiled. To this her husband made answer that he had laughed spontaneously; but that, if in any event he should be led to tell her the cause of his laughter, she might take it for certain that the Fates would without more ado cut the thread of his life, and that he would die on the spot. But the importunate woman was not satisfied with this, and replied that she wanted, at all hazard, to know the reason why he had thus laughed; adding that if he would not tell her she would lay hold of him by the weazand. Then the husband, finding himself thus placed in a position of difficulty and danger, answered her, speaking thus, ""When we shall have returned to Pozzuolo you shall set in order all my affairs, and make all the necessary provisions both for my body and my soul after death. Then I will make known to you all you want to learn."" As soon as her husband had given her this promise the wicked and malicious woman was silent, and when they were returned to Pozzuolo she quickly recalled to mind the promise which had been made to her, and forthwith besought her husband to be as good as his word. Whereupon Federigo replied by charging her to go at once and fetch the priest, forasmuch as, seeing that he must needs die on account of this matter, he was anxious first to confess himself, and to recommend himself to his Maker. As soon as she should have done this, he would tell her all. Thereupon the wife, who was determined to see her husband lying dead rather than give up aught of her pestilent wishes, went forthwith to summon the confessor. At this moment, while Federigo was lying in his bed, overcome with grief, he heard his dog address certain words to his cock, who was crowing aloud, ""Are you not ashamed of yourself, wretch and ribald that you are, to crow thus? Our good master is lying very near his last breath, and you, who ought to be sorrowful and full of melancholy, keep on crowing as if you rejoiced thereat."" To these words the cock promptly made answer, ""And supposing that our master should die, what have I to do with that? Am I, indeed, to be charged with causing his death? He wishes to die of his own accord. Do you not know what is written in the first book of the Politics [by Aristotle], 'The wife and the servant stand on the same footing.' Seeing, therefore, that the husband is the head of the wife, it is her bounden duty to regard the usages and customs of her husband as the laws of her life. I, forsooth, have a hundred wives, and, through the workings of fear, I make them all most obedient to my commandments, castigating now one and now another, and giving pecks wherever I may think they are deserved. And this master of ours has only a single wife, yet he knows naught how to manage her, and to make her obedient to his commands. Let him die forthwith. Do you not believe that our mistress will soon find for herself another husband? So let it be with him, seeing that he is a man of such little account, and one disposed to give way to the foolish and unbridled will of his wife."" The young man, when he had comprehended and well considered in his mind the words he had just listened to, at once altered his purpose, and felt deeply grateful to the cock for what he had said. The wife, after she had come back from seeking the priest, was still pertinacious to learn the cause of her husband's laughter; wherefore he, having seized her by the hair, began to beat her, and gave her so many and lusty blows that he nearly left her for dead. This fable did not vastly please those of the listeners who were ladies, especially when they heard tell of the sound basting which Federigo gave his wife. Nevertheless, they grieved amain when they heard how she would fain have been the cause of her husband's death.",Giovanni Francesco Straparola,"Source: Straparola, The Facetious Nights, translated by W.

The Language of Animals,0670,Ramai and the Bonga,"Ramai said that he was afraid that the bonga would eat him but the bonga swore to do him no harm, so he lifted up the stone and the bonga came out and thanking Ramai told him to ask a boon. Ramai asked for the power to see bongas and to understand the language of ants. ""I will give you the power,"" said the bonga, ""but you must tell no one about it, not even your wife; if you do you will lose the power and in that case you must not blame me,"" Then the bonga blew into his ear and he heard the speech of ants; and the bonga scratched the film of his eye balls with a thorn and he saw the bongas: and there were crowds of them living in villages like men. In December when we thresh the rice the bongas carry off half of it; but Ramai could see them and would drive them away and so was able to save his rice. Once a young fellow of his own age was very ill; and his friends blew into his ears and partially brought him to his senses and he asked them to send for Ramai; so they called Ramai and he had just been milking his cows and came with the tethering rope in his hand; and when he entered the room he saw a bonga sitting on the sick man's chest and twisting his neck; so he flogged it with the rope till it ran away and he pursued it until it threw itself into a pool of water; and then the sick man recovered. But Ramai soon lost his useful power; one day as he was eating his dinner he dropped some grains of rice, and two ants fell to quarrelling over one grain, and Ramai heard them abusing each other and was so amused that he laughed out loud. His wife asked why he laughed, and he said at nothing in particular, but she insisted on knowing and he said that it was at some scandal he had heard in the village; but she would not believe him and worried him until he told her that it was at the quarrel of the ants. Then she made him tell her how he gained the power to understand what they said. But from that moment he lost the powers which the bonga had conferred on him.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 157, pp. 393-95.","A bonga is a household spirit, comparable to a brownie.",NA
The Language of Animals,0670,The Billy Goat and the King,"This king, I must tell you, was a Hindu; and when a Hindu eats his food he has a nice little place on the ground freshly plastered with mud, and he sits in the middle of it with very few clothes on -- which is quite a different way from ours. Well, one day the king was eating his dinner in just such a nice, clean, mud-plastered spot, and his wife was sitting opposite to wait upon him and keep him company. As he ate he dropped some grains of rice upon the ground, and a little ant, who was running about seeking a living, seized upon one of the grains and bore it off towards his hole. Just outside the king's circle this ant met another ant, and the king heard the second one say, ""Oh, dear friend, do give me that grain of rice, and get another one for yourself. You see my boots are so dirty that, if I were to go upon the king's eating place, I should defile it, and I can't do that, it would be so very rude."" But the owner of the grain of rice only replied, ""If you want rice go and get it. No one will notice your dirty boots; and you don't suppose that I am going to carry rice for all our kindred?"" Then the king laughed. The queen looked at herself up and down, but she could not see or feel anything in her appearance to make the king laugh, so she said, ""What are you laughing at?"" ""Did I laugh?"" replied the king. ""Of course you did,"" retorted the queen; ""and if you think that I am ridiculous I wish you would say so, instead of behaving in that stupid way! What are you laughing at?"" ""I'm not laughing at anything,"" answered the king. ""Very well, but you did laugh, and l want to know why."" ""Well, I'm afraid I can't tell you,"" said the king. ""You must tell me,"" replied the queen impatiently. ""If you laugh when there's nothing to laugh at you must be ill or mad. What is the matter? Still the king refused to say, and still the queen declared that she must and would know. For days the quarrel went on, and the queen gave her husband no rest, until at last the poor man was almost out of his wits, and thought that, as life had become for him hardly worth living while this went on, he might as well tell her the secret and take the consequences. ""But,"" thought he, ""if I am to become a stone, I am not going to lie, if I can help it, on some dusty highway, to be kicked here and there by man and beast, flung at dogs, be used as the plaything of naughty children, and become generally restless and miserable. I will be a stone at the bottom of the cool river, and roll gently about there until I find some secure resting place where I can stay for ever."" So he told his wife that if she would ride with him to the middle of the river he would tell her what he had laughed at. She thought he was joking, and laughingly agreed; their horses were ordered and they set out. On the way they came to a fine well beneath the shade of some lofty, wide-spreading trees, and the king proposed that they should get off and rest a little, drink some of the cool water, and then pass on. To this the queen consented; so they dismounted and sat down in the shade by the well-side to rest. It happened that an old goat and his wife were browsing in the neighbourhood, and, as the king and queen sat there, the nanny goat came to the well's brink and peering over saw some lovely green leaves that sprang in tender shoots out of the side of the well. ""Oh!"" cried she to her husband, ""come quickly and look. Here are some leaves which make my mouth water; come and get them for me!"" Then the billy goat sauntered up and looked over, and after that he eyed his wife a little crossly. ""You expect me to get you those leaves, do you? I suppose you don't consider how in the world I am to reach them? You don't seem to think at all; if you did you would know that if I tried to reach those leaves I should fall into the well and be drowned!"" ""Oh,"" cried the nanny goat, ""why should you fall in? Do try and get them!"" ""I am not going to be so silly,"" replied the billy goat. But the nanny goat still wept and entreated. ""Look here,"" said her husband, ""there are plenty of fools in the world, but I am not one of them. This silly king here, because he can't cure his wife of asking questions, is going to throw his life away. But I know how to cure you of your follies, and I'm going to."" And with that he butted the nanny goat so severely that in two minutes she was submissively feeding somewhere else, and had made up her mind that the leaves in the well were not worth having. Then the king, who had understood every word, laughed once more. The queen looked at him suspiciously, but the king got up and walked across to where she sat. ""Are you still determined to find out what I was laughing at the other day?"" he asked. ""Quite,"" answered the queen angrily. ""Because,"" said the king, tapping his leg with his riding whip, ""I've made up my mind not to tell you, and moreover, I have made up my mind to stop you mentioning the subject any more."" ""What do you mean?"" asked the queen nervously. ""Well,"" replied the king, ""I notice that if that goat is displeased with his wife, he just butts her, and that seems to settle the question."" ""Do you mean to say you would beat me?"" cried the queen. ""I should be extremely sorry to have to do so,"" replied the king; ""but I have to persuade you to go home quietly, and to ask no more silly questions when I say I cannot answer them. Of course, if you will persist, why --"" And the queen went home, and so did the king; and it is said that they are both happier and wiser than ever before.","India, Andrew Lang","Source: Andrew Lang, The Olive Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1907), pp. 211-15.","Note by Lang: Punjabi story, Major Campbell, Feroshepore.",NA
The Language of Animals,0670,"The Bull, the Donkey, and the Husbandman","Once Allah endowed a wealthy husbandman with the ability to understand the language of every kind of beast and bird, commanding him, under pain of death, never to divulge this gift. Fearing for his life, the husbandman guarded the secret well. One day while observing his animals, he heard a bull say to a donkey, ""Lucky one, you enjoy the best of care, while I suffer all manner of ill treatment. I toil under the yoke by day, receive but a meager ration of beans and straw, and must lie at night in a filthy stall. You, by comparison, eat well and lie about at ease unless the master chooses to ride you into town, which happens seldom enough, and even then he returns with you straight-away."" ""You fool,"" replied the donkey. ""You could have an easier life, if you would only feign illness. When they next take you to your stall, fall to the ground, puff out your belly, and refuse to eat. This will surely bring a reprieve from your accustomed blows and toil."" The bull did as the donkey recommended and pretended to be sick. However, the master, who had overheard their conversation, responded by binding the wily donkey to the plow and forcing him to do the bull's work. The donkey, unaccustomed to such labor, suffered greatly under the yoke and the plowman's stick, while the bull enjoyed a day of rest. At day's end, the donkey, nearly dead from exertion and blows, came quickly to a new plan. ""My friend,"" he said to the bull, ""you have a bleak future if you do not soon recover your strength. I heard the master say that he intends to deliver you to the butcher, who will turn your flesh into meat for the poor and your hide into a leather mat."" The husbandman heard this all. The next morning the husbandman, accompanied by his wife, approached the bull in his stall. The beast gave a great show of health and vigor, whisking his tail, farting, and frisking lustily about. The master, greatly amused at the turn of events, broke into laughter. ""Why do you laugh?"" asked his wife. ""I cannot tell you, lest I die."" replied the man. ""So be it,"" answered the woman, ""but I must know why you laughed."" She continued to wheedle and to beg, until he, sensing that he could not forever resist her unrelenting pleas, resigned himself to his fate. He brought his affairs to order, then prepared to reveal his secret and to die. Now the husbandman had some fifty hens, all serviced by one rooster. The rooster, lustily mounting one hen after the other, was interrupted by one of the farm dogs, who said, ""For shame, that you thus satisfy your lust on this day that our master is to die."" The rooster replied, ""What sort of master do we have, who cannot manage a single wife? I control fifty hens."" ""And what should the master do?"" asked the dog. ""He should cut a branch from yonder mulberry tree then use it on her back and ribs until she repents. Then let him give her another beating for good measure, and henceforth he will sleep well and enjoy life."" The husbandman heard this conversation between the dog and the rooster, and he took it to heart. He cut a branch from the mulberry tree and proceeded with it to his wife's room. Locking the door behind him, he announced that he was about to reveal his secret to her, but then began to beat her soundly about her back, shoulders, ribs, arms, and legs, all the while saying, ""Are you ever again going to ask questions about matters that do not concern you?"" Nearly senseless, she finally cried out, ""I repent! With Allah as a witness, I will never again question you."" She then kissed his hands and his feet, and he led her from the room as submissive as a wife should be. Her parents and other members of the family rejoiced at the turn of events. Thus the husbandman learned family discipline from his rooster, and he and his wife lived together the happiest of lives until they died.",The 1001 Nights,"Source: The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, translated by Richard F.

The Language of Animals,0670,The Dog and the Cock,"One day the dog and the cock were walking in the farmyard. The cock was cheerful, flapping his wings and crowing lustily, but the dog hung his tail and appeared to be buried in sad thoughts. Angry at the cock's cheerfulness, he said, ""I cannot understand how you can be so happy!"" ""Why not?"" asked the cock. ""Can't you see,"" said the dog, ""that our master has been going around with a long face for a few days now? I think that we should be sharing his concerns."" ""What are his concerns?"" asked the cock. ""About his wife,"" said the dog. ""She is so bad that he never gets a good word from her. She is never satisfied with anything he does or says. A woman like that can be the death of a man!"" ""She wouldn't be the death of me,"" answered the cock. ""I have seventy wives, and if I ever had to hang my head because something went wrong, the devil would be in charge, not I. No, I handle them differently. My wives receive blows if they are stubborn and don't want to listen to me. And if they get in each others' hair, I pull them apart. In this manner I get along splendidly with my seventy wives, and if our master can't deal with his one wife, then he is a sorry fellow indeed!"" And with that the cock proudly and cheerfully went on his way. Now the master had been listening in on this entire conversation, so he went to his wife. Once again she had bad words for him, so he answered her with an appropriate measure of blows, and from that time onward she was as tame and agreeable as never before.",Denmark,"Source: Svendt Grundtvig, ""Hunden og Hanen,"" Gamle danske Minder i Folkemunde (Copenhagen: C.

The Language of Animals,0670,The King and His Inquisitive Queen,"The serpent then went to Monsha, the king of the serpents, and complained of the treatment the lizard and himself had received at the hands of king Huntsman. The next day king Monsha went and met king Huntsman on his way home from the forest, and blocked his way so that he could not pass. King Huntsman being angry said, ""Clear the way, and allow me to pass, or else I shall send an arrow into you. Why do you block my way?"" King Monsha replied, ""Why did you assault the lizard and the serpent, with intent to kill them both?"" King Huntsman answered, ""I ordered them to get out of my way, but they would not, I therefore assaulted them, and killed one. The other saved himself by flight."" King Monsha hearing this explanation said, ""Very good, the fault was theirs, not yours."" King Huntsman then petitioned the king of the serpents to bestow upon him the gift of understanding the language of animals and insects. King Monsha acceded to his request, and gave him the gift he desired. A few days after this event king Huntsman went to the forest, and after hunting all day returned home in the evening. Having washed his hands and feet, he sat down to his meal of boiled rice. When the rice was being served to the king a few grains fell on the ground, and a fly and an ant began to dispute as to who should carry them away. The fly said, ""I will take them to my children."" The ant replied, ""No, I will take them to mine."" Hearing the two talk thus, the king was amused, and began to smile. The queen, who was standing by, said to him, ""Tell me what has made you laugh."" On being thus addressed the king became greatly confused, for at the time the gift of understanding the language of animals and insects was bestowed upon him, king Monsha had forbidden him to make it known to anyone. He had said, ""If you tell this to any one, I shall eat you."" Remembering this the king feared to answer the question put to him by the queen. He tried to deceive her by saying, ""I did not laugh, you must have been mistaken."" She would not, however, be thus put off, so the king was obliged to tell her that if he answered her question his life would be forfeited. The queen was inexorable, and said, ""Whether you forfeit your life or not, you must tell me."" The king then said, ""Well, if it must be so, let us make ready to go to the bank of the Ganges. There I shall tell you, and when I have done so you must push me into the river, and then return home."" The king armed himself, and the two set out for the river. When they had reached it, they sat down to rest under the shade of a tree A flock of goats was grazing near to where they were seated, and the king's attention was arrested by a conversation which was being carried on between an old she- goat and a young he-goat. The former addressed the latter thus, ""There is an island in the middle of the Ganges, and on that island there is a large quantity of good sweet grass. Get the grass for me, and I shall give you my daughter in marriage."" The he-goat was not thus to be imposed upon. He angrily addressed his female friend as follows, ""Do not think to make me like this foolish king, who vainly tries to please a woman. He has come here to lose his own life at the bidding of one. You tell me to go and bring you grass out of such a flood as this. I am no such fool. I do not care to die yet. There are many more quite as good as your daughter."" The king understood what passed between them, and admitted to himself the truth of what the he-goat had said. After considering a short time he arose, and having made a rude sacrificial altar, said to the queen, ""Kneel down, and do me obeisance, and I shall tell you what made me laugh."" She knelt down, and the king struck off her head and burnt her body upon the altar. Returning home he performed her funeral ceremonies, after which he married another wife. He reigned prosperously for many years, and decided all disputes that were brought before him by animals or insects.",India,"Source: A.

The Language of Animals,0670,The King Who Learnt the Speech of Animals,"In a certain country a king was rearing wild animals. The king had learnt in a thorough manner the speech of animals. One day at that time the fowls were saying, ""Our king assists us very much; he gives us food and drink."" They thanked the king very much. The king having heard their talk, the king laughed with pleasure. The royal queen having been near, asked, ""What did you laugh at?"" ""I merely (nikan) laughed,"" the king said. Should he explain and give the talk to any person the king will die. Because of it he did not explain and give it. That the king knows the speech of animals he does not inform anyone. The royal queen says, ""There is no one who laughs in that way without a reason. Should you not say the reason I am going away, or having jumped into a well I shall die."" Thereupon the king, because he was unable to be released from [the importunity of] the queen, thought, ""Even if I am to die I must explain and give this."" Thinking thus, he went to give food to the animals. Then it was evident to those animals that this king is going to die. Out of the party of animals first a cock says, ""His majesty our king is going to be lost. We don't want the food. We shall not receive assistance. Unless his majesty the king perish thus we shall not perish. In submission to me there are many hens. When I have called them the hens come. When I have told them to eat they eat. When I have told them to go they go. The king, having become submissive in that manner to the thing that his wife has said, is going to die."" The king having heard it, laughed at it also. Then, also, the royal queen asked, ""What did you laugh at?"" Thereupon, not saying the [true] word, the king said, ""Thinking of constructing a tank, I laughed."" Then the queen said, ""Having caused the animals that are in this Lankawa (Ceylon) to be brought, let us build a tank."" Then the king having said, ""It is good,"" caused the animals to be brought. The king having gone with the animals, showed them a place [in which] to build a tank; and telling them to build it came away. The animals, at the king's command being unable to do anything, all together began to struggle on the mound of earth. Those which can take earth in the mouth take it in the mouth. All work in this manner. The jackal, not doing work, having bounded away remained looking on. After three or four days, the king having gone [there] trickishly stayed looking on. The king saw that the other animals are all moving about as though working. The jackal, only, having bounded off is looking on. Having seen it he asked the jackal, ""The others are all working. Thou, only, art looking upward. Why?"" Thereupon the jackal said, ""No, O lord, I looked into an account."" Then the king asked, ""What account art thou looking at?"" The jackal says, ""I looked whether in this country the female3s are in excess or the males are in excess."" The king asked, ""By the account which thou knowest, are the females in excess or the males in excess?"" The jackal said, ""So far as I can perceive, the females are in excess in this country."" Then the king said that men are in excess. Having said it the king said, ""I myself having gone home and looked at the books, if males are in excess I shall give thee a good punishment."" The king having come home and looked at the books, it appeared that the males were in excess. Thereupon the king called the jackal, and said, ""Bola, males are in excess."" Then the jackal says, ""No, O lord, your majesty, they are not as many as the females. Having also put down to the female account the males who hearken to the things that females say, after they counted them the females would be in excess."" Then the jackal said, ""Are the animals able to build tanks? How shall they carry the earth?"" Thereupon the king having considered it, and having said, ""Wild animals, wild animals, you are to go to the midst of the forest,"" came home. At that time, the queen asked, ""Is the tank built and finished?"" Then the king, taking a cane, began to beat the queen. Thereupon the queen, having said, ""Ané! O lord, your majesty, I will never again say anything, or even ask anything,"" began to cry aloud. The king got to know that the jackal was a wise animal. Western Province.",Sri Lanka,"Source: H.

The Language of Animals,0670,The Language of Animals,"Once upon a time when a king named Senaka was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was Sakka. The king Senaka was friendly with a certain naga king. This naga king, they say, left the naga world and ranged the earth seeking food. The village boys seeing him said, ""This is a snake,"" and struck him with clods and other things. The king, going to amuse himself in his garden, saw them, and being told they were beating a snake, said, ""Don't let them beat him. Drive them away."" And this was done. So the naga king got his life, and when he went back to the naga world. He took many jewels, and coming at midnight to the king's bedchamber he gave them to him, saying, ""I got my life through you."" So he made friendship with the king and came again and again to see him. He appointed one of his naga girls, insatiate in pleasures, to be near the king and protect him, and he gave the king a charm, saying, ""If ever you do not see her, repeat this charm."" One day the king went to the garden with the naga girl and was amusing himself in the lotus tank. The naga girl seeing a water snake quitted her human shape and made love with him. The king not seeing the girl said, ""Where is she gone?"" and repeated the spell. Then he saw her in her misconduct and struck her with a piece of bamboo. She went in anger to the naga world, and when she was asked, ""Why are you come?"" she said, ""Your friend struck me on the back because I did not do his bidding,"" showing the mark of the blow. The naga king, not knowing the truth, called four naga youths and sent them with orders to enter Senaka's bedchamber and destroy him like chaff by the breath of their nostrils. They entered the chamber at the royal bedtime. As they came in, the king was saying to the queen, ""Lady, do you know where the naga girl has gone?"" ""King, I do not."" ""Today when we were bathing in the tank, she quitted her shape and misconducted herself with a water snake. I said, 'Don't do that,' and struck her with a piece of bamboo to give her a lesson. And now I fear she may have gone to the naga world and told some lie to my friend, destroying his goodwill to me."" The young nagas hearing this turned back at once to the naga world and told their king. He being moved went instantly to the king's chamber, told him all and was forgiven. Then he said, ""In this way I make amends,"" and gave the king a charm giving knowledge of all sounds. ""This, O king, is a priceless spell. If you give anyone this spell you will at once enter the fire and die."" The king said, ""It is well,"" and accepted it. From that time he understood the voice even of ants. One day he was sitting on the dais eating solid food with honey and molasses, and a drop of honey, a drop of molasses, and a morsel of cake fell on the ground. An ant seeing this comes crying, ""The king's honey jar is broken on the dais, his molasses cart and cake cart are upset. Come and eat honey and molasses and cake."" The king hearing the cry laughed. The queen being near him thought, ""What has the king seen that he laughs?"" When the king had eaten his solid food and bathed and sat down cross-legged, a fly said to his wife, ""Come, lady, let us enjoy love."" She said, ""Excuse me for a little, husband. They will soon be bringing perfumes to the king. As he perfumes himself some powder will fall at his feet. I will stay there and become fragrant, then we will enjoy ourselves lying on the king's back."" The king hearing the voice laughed again. The queen thought again, ""What has he seen that he laughs?"" Again when the king was eating his supper, a lump of rice fell on the ground. The ants cried, ""A wagon of rice has broken in the king's palace, and there is none to eat it."" The king hearing this laughed again. The queen took a golden spoon and helping him reflected, ""Is it at the sight of me that the king laughs?"" She went to the bedchamber with the king and at bedtime she asked, ""Why did you laugh, O king?"" He said, ""What have you to do with why I laugh?"" But being asked again and again her told her. Then she said, ""Give me your spell of knowledge."" He said, ""It cannot be given."" But though repulsed she pressed him again. The king said, ""If I give you this spell, I shall die."" ""Even though you die, give it me."" The king, being in the power of womankind, saying, ""It is well,"" consented and went to the park in a chariot, saying, ""I shall enter the fire after giving away this spell."" At that moment Sakka, king of gods, looked down on the earth and seeing this case said, ""This foolish king, knowing that he will enter the fire through womankind, is on the way; I will give him his life."" So he took Suja, daughter of the Asuras, and went to Benares. He became a he-goat and made her a she-goat, and resolving that the people should not see them, he stood before the king's chariot. The king and the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot saw him, but none else saw him. For the sake of starting talk he was as if making love with the she-goat. One of the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot seeing him said, ""Friend goat, we have heard before, but not seen, that goats are stupid and shameless. But you are doing, with all of us looking on, this thing that should be done in secret and in a private place, and are not ashamed. What we have heard before agrees with this that we see."" And so he spoke the first stanza: The goat hearing him spoke two stanzas: When you're loosed, you don't escape, sir, that's a stupid habit too: And that Senaka you carry, he's more stupid still than you. The king understood the talk of both animals, and hearing it he quickly sent away the chariot. The ass hearing the goat's talk spoke the fourth stanza: The goat explaining this spoke the fifth stanza: The king hearing his words said, ""King of goats, you will surely act for my advantage. Tell me now what is right for me to do."" Then the goat said, ""King, to all animals no one is dearer than self. It is not good to destroy oneself and abandon the honor one has gained for the sake of anything that is dear."" So he spoke the sixth stanza: So the Bodhisatta exhorted the king. The king, delighted, asked, ""King of goats, whence come you?"" ""I am Sakka, O king, come to save you from death out of pity for you."" ""King of gods, I promised to give her the charm. What am I to do now?"" ""There is no need for the ruin of both of you. You say, 'It is the way of the craft,' and have her beaten with some blows. By this means she will not get it."" The king said, ""It is well,"" and agreed. The Bodhisatta after exhortation to the king went to Sakka's heaven. The king went to the garden, had the queen summoned and then said, ""Lady, will you have the charm?"" ""Yes, lord."" ""Then go through the usual custom."" ""What custom?"" ""A hundred stripes on the back, but you must not make a sound."" She consented through greed for the charm. The king made his slaves take whips and beat her on both sides. She endured two or three stripes and then cried, ""I don't want the charm."" The king said, ""You would have killed me to get the charm,"" and so flogging the skin off her back he sent her away. After that she could not bear to talk of it again. When the serpent saw him, it screamed, ""Dear shepherd, do a good action; take me out of this fire."" The shepherd took pity on its words, and reached it his crook, and it crawled out upon it. When it had crawled out, it coiled itself round his neck. When the shepherd saw this, he was frightened, and said, ""Indeed you are a wretch! Is that the way you are going to thank me for rescuing you? So runs the proverb: 'Do good, and find evil.'"" The serpent answered him, ""Don't fear. I shall do you no harm. Only carry me to my father; my father is the emperor of the serpents."" The shepherd begged pardon, and excused himself, ""I can't carry you to your father, because I have no one to leave in charge of my sheep."" The serpent said to him, ""Don't fear for your sheep; nothing will happen to them. Only carry me to my father, and go quickly."" Then there was no help for it, so he started with it over the hill. When he came to a door, which was formed of nothing but serpents intertwined, and went up to it, the serpent which was coiled round his neck gave a whistle, and the serpents, which had twined themselves into the form of a door, immediately untwined, and made way for them to enter. As the shepherd and the serpent entered the palace, the serpent called to the shepherd, ""Stop! Let me tell you something: when you come into my father's palace, he will promise you what you desire, silver and gold; but don't you accept anything, only ask him to give you such a tongue that you will be able to understand all animals. He will not give you this readily, but at last grant it you he will."" The shepherd went with it into its father's palace, and its father, on seeing it, shed tears, and asked it, ""Hey, my son, where have you been till now?"" It replied, and told him everything in order: what had taken place, and how it had taken place, and how the shepherd had rescued it. Then the emperor of the serpents turned to the shepherd, and said to him, ""Come, my son, what do you wish me to give you in recompense for rescuing my child?"" The shepherd replied to him, ""Nothing else, only give me such a tongue that I can understand all animals."" The emperor of the serpents said to him, ""That is not a proper gift for you, my son, because, if I give you anything of the kind, you will betray yourself in somebody's presence by boasting of it, and then you will die immediately. Ask something else."" The shepherd replied to him, ""I wish for nothing else. If you will give it me, give it; if not, farewell!"" He turned to go; but the emperor of the serpents cried out, ""Stay! Return! If you ask this, come, that I may give it you. Open your mouth."" The shepherd opened his mouth, and the emperor of the serpents spat into it, and told him to spit also into his mouth. And thus they spat thrice into each other's mouths. When this was done, the emperor of the serpents said to the shepherd, ""Now you have the tongue which you desired. Go, and farewell! But it is not permitted you to tell anybody, because, if you do, you will die. I am telling you the truth."" The shepherd then departed. As he went over the hill, he understood the conversation of the birds, and, so to speak, of everything in the world. When he came to his sheep, he found them correct in number, and sat down to rest. But scarcely had he lain down, when two crows flew up, perched on a tree hard by him, and began to converse in their language, ""If that shepherd knew that just where that black lamb lies a vault full of silver and gold is buried in the ground, he would take its contents."" When he heard this, he went and told his master, and he brought a cart, and they broke open the door of the vault, and took out its valuable contents. His master was a righteous man, and said to him, ""Well, my son, this is all yours; the Lord has given it you. Go, provide a house, get married, and live comfortably."" The shepherd took the property, went away, provided a house, got married, and lived very comfortably. This shepherd, after a little time, became so rich and prosperous that there was nobody richer than he in his own or the neighboring villages. He had shepherds, cowherds, swineherds, grooms, and everything on a handsome scale. Once upon a time this shepherd ordered his wife on New Year's Eve to provide wine, brandy, and everything requisite, and to go the next morning to his cattle, to take the provisions to the herdsmen, that they, too, might enjoy themselves. His wife obeyed him, and did as her husband ordered her. The next day they got up, got ready, and went. When they arrived where the cattle were, the master said to his shepherds, ""Lads, assemble together, and sit down to eat and drink your fill, and I will watch the cattle tonight."" This was done; they assembled together, and he went out to sleep by the cattle. In the course of the night, after some time, the wolves began to howl and speak in their language, and the dogs to bark and speak in theirs. The wolves said, ""Can we capture any young cattle?"" The dogs answered in their language, ""Come in, that we, too, may eat our fill of flesh."" But among the dogs there was one old dog, who had only two teeth left. This dog spoke and answered the wolves, ""In faith, as long as these two teeth of mine last, you shan't come near to do harm to my master."" In the morning, when it dawned, the master called the herdsmen, and told them to kill all the dogs except that old one. His servants began to implore him, ""Don't, master! Why? It's a sin."" But he said to them, ""Do just as I ordered you, and not otherwise."" Then he and his wife mounted their horses and went off. His wife rode a mare, and he a horse. As they went, the master's horse outstripped the wife's mare, and began to say to her in their language, ""Go quicker. Why do you hang back?"" The mare's reply in defense of her lagging pace was so amusing that the man laughed out loud, turned his head, and looked behind him with a smile. His wife observed him smiling, whipped her mare to catch him up, and then asked him to tell her why he smiled. He said to her, ""Well, suppose I did? Something came into my head."" This answer did not satisfy her, but she began to worry him to tell her why he smiled. He said this and that to her to get out of it, but the more he said to get out of it, the more did she worry him. At length he said to her that, if he told her, he would die immediately. But she had no dread of her husband's dying, and went on worrying him: ""There is no alternative, but tell me you must."" When they got home, they dismounted from their horses, and as soon as they had done so, her husband ordered a grave to be dug for him. It was dug, and he lay down in it, and said to his wife, ""Did you not press me to tell you why I smiled? Come now, that I may tell you; but I shall die immediately."" On saying this, he gave one more look round him, and observed that the old dog had come from the cattle. Seeing this, he told his wife to give him a piece of bread. She gave it him, but the dog would not even look at it, but shed tears and wept. But the cock, seeing it, ran up and began to peck it. The dog was angry, and said, ""As if you'd die hungry! Don't you see that our master is going to die?"" ""What a fool he is! Let him die! Whose fault is it? I have a hundred wives. When I find a grain of millet, I call them all to me, and finally eat it myself. If one of them gets cross at this, I give her one or two pecks, and she lowers her tail. But this man isn't equal to keeping one in order."" When the man heard the cock say this, he jumped up at once out of the grave, seized a stick, chased his wife over hill and dale, and at last settled her completely, so that it never entered her head any more to ask him why he smiled.","from The Jataka; or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births Bulgaria","Source: The Jataka; or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births (Cambridge: The Cambridge University Press, 1897), no. 386, vol. 3. pp. 174-77.

The Language of Animals,0670,The Language of Beasts,"The shepherd stood wondering how the poor snake could escape, for the wind was blowing the flames that way, and soon that tree would be burning like the rest. Suddenly the snake cried, ""O shepherd! for the love of heaven save me from this fire!"" Then the shepherd stretched his staff out over the flames and the snake wound itself round the staff and up to his hand, and from his hand it crept up his arm, and twined itself about his neck. The shepherd trembled with fright, expecting every instant to be stung to death, and said, ""What an unlucky man I am! Did I rescue you only to be destroyed myself?"" But the snake answered, ""Have no fear; only carry me home to my father who is the King of the Snakes."" The shepherd, however, was much too frightened to listen, and said that he could not go away and leave his flock alone; but the snake said, ""You need not be afraid to leave your flock, no evil shall befall them; but make all the haste you can."" So he set off through the wood carrying the snake, and after a time he came to a great gateway, made entirely of snakes intertwined one with another. The shepherd stood still with surprise, but the snake round his neck whistled, and immediately all the arch unwound itself. ""When we are come to my father's house,"" said his own snake to him, ""he will reward you with anything you like to ask -- silver, gold, jewels, or whatever on this earth is most precious; but take none of all these things, ask rather to understand the language of beasts. He will refuse it to you a long time, but in the end he will grant it to you."" Soon after that they arrived at the house of the King of the Snakes, who burst into tears of joy at the sight of his daughter, as he had given her up for dead. ""Where have you been all this time?"" he asked, directly he could speak, and she told him that she had been caught in a forest fire, and had been rescued from the flames by the shepherd. The King of the Snakes, then turning to the shepherd, said to him, ""What reward will you choose for saving my child?"" ""Make me to know the language of beasts,"" answered the shepherd, ""that is all I desire."" The king replied, ""Such knowledge would be of no benefit to you, for if I granted it to you and you told any one of it, you would immediately die; ask me rather for whatever else you would most like to possess, and it shall be yours."" But the shepherd answered him, ""Sir, if you wish to reward me for saving your daughter, grant me, I pray you, to know the language of beasts. I desire nothing else""; and he turned as if to depart. Then the king called him back, saying, ""If nothing else will satisfy you, open your mouth."" The man obeyed, and the king spat into it, and said, ""Now spit into my mouth."" The shepherd did as he was told, then the King of the Snakes spat again into the shepherd's mouth. When they had spat into each other's mouths three times, the king said, ""Now you know the language of beasts, go in peace; but, if you value your life, beware lest you tell anyone of it, else you will immediately die."" So the shepherd set out for home, and on his way through the wood he heard and understood all that was said by the birds, and by every living creature. When he got back to his sheep he found the flock grazing peacefully, and as he was very tired he laid himself down by them to rest a little. Hardly had he done so when two ravens flew down and perched on a tree nearby, and began to talk to each other in their own language, ""If that shepherd only knew that there is a vault full of gold and silver beneath where that lamb is lying, what would he not do?"" When the shepherd heard these words he went straight to his master and told him, and the master at once took a wagon, and broke open the door of the vault, and they carried off the treasure. But instead of keeping it for himself, the master, who was an honorable man, gave it all up to the shepherd, saying, ""Take it, it is yours. The gods have given it to you."" So the shepherd took the treasure and built himself a house. He married a wife, and they lived in great peace and happiness, and he was acknowledged to be the richest man, not only of his native village, but of all the countryside. He had flocks of sheep, and cattle, and horses without end, as well as beautiful clothes and jewels. One day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife, ""Prepare everything for a great feast, tomorrow we will take things with us to the farm that the shepherds there may make merry."" The wife obeyed, and all was prepared as he desired. Next day they both went to the farm, and in the evening the master said to the shepherds, ""Now come, all of you, eat, drink, and make merry. I will watch the flocks myself tonight in your stead."" Then he went out to spend the night with the flocks. When midnight struck the wolves howled and the dogs barked, and the wolves spoke in their own tongue, saying, ""Shall we come in and work havoc, and you too shall eat flesh?"" And the dogs answered in their tongue, ""Come in, and for once we shall have enough to eat."" Now amongst the dogs there was one so old that he had only two teeth left in his head, and he spoke to the wolves, saying, ""So long as I have my two teeth still in my head, I will let no harm be done to my master."" All this the master heard and understood, and as soon as morning dawned he ordered all the dogs to be killed excepting the old dog. The farm servants wondered at this order, and exclaimed, ""But surely, sir, that would be a pity?"" The master answered, ""Do as I bid you""; and made ready to return home with his wife, and they mounted their horses, her steed being a mare. As they went on their way, it happened that the husband rode on ahead, while the wife was a little way behind. The husband's horse, seeing this, neighed, and said to the mare, ""Come along, make haste; why are you so slow?"" And the mare answered, ""It is very easy for you, you carry only your master, who is a thin man, but I carry my mistress, who is so fat that she weights as much as three."" When the husband heard that he looked back and laughed, which the wife perceiving, she urged on the mare till she caught up with her husband, and asked him why he laughed. ""For nothing at all,"" he answered; ""just because it came into my head."" She would not be satisfied with this answer, and urged him more and more to tell her why he had laughed. But he controlled himself and said, ""Let me be, wife; what ails you? I do not know myself why I laughed."" But the more he put her off, the more she tormented him to tell her the cause of his laughter. At length he said to her, ""Know, then, that if I tell it you I shall immediately and surely die."" But even this did not quiet her; she only besought him the more to tell her. Meanwhile they had reached home, and before getting down from his horse the man called for a coffin to be brought; and when it was there he placed it in front of the house, and said to his wife, ""See, I will lay myself down in this coffin, and will then tell you why I laughed, for as soon as I have told you I shall surely die."" So he lay down in the coffin, and while he took a last look around him, his old dog came out from the farm and sat down by him, and whined. When the master saw this, he called to his wife, ""Bring a piece of bread to give to the dog."" The wife brought some bread and threw it to the dog, but he would not look at it. Then the farm cock came and pecked at the bread; but the dog said to it, ""Wretched glutton, you can eat like that when you see that your master is dying?"" The cock answered, ""Let him die, if he is so stupid. I have a hundred wives, which I call together when I find a grain of corn, and as soon as they are there I swallow it myself; should one of them dare to be angry, I would give her a lesson with my beak. He has only one wife, and he cannot keep her in order."" As soon as the man understood this, he got up out of the coffin, seized a stick, and called his wife into the room, saying, ""Come, and I will tell you what you so much want to know""; and then he began to beat her with the stick, saying with each blow, ""It is that, wife, it is that!"" And in this way he taught her never again to ask why he had laughed.","Bulgaria, Andrew Lang","Source: Andrew Lang, The Crimson Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1903), pp. 55-61.",NA,NA
The Language of Animals,0670,The Merchant Who Knew the Language of Beasts,"There was once a merchant who knew the language of beasts. But this knowledge had been granted him only upon condition that, if he told the secrets learnt by its means, he should instantly die. No one, not even his wife, was aware that he was gifted beyond the common. One evening, standing near his stables, he heard an ox, which had just returned from plowing, complaining bitterly of his hard labor, and asking the ass on which the merchant rode to business how he might lighten it. The ass advised him to be very ill, to leave his food untouched and roll on the ground in pain when the plowman came to take him to the field. The ox took this advice, and next day his master was told he was too ill to work. The merchant prescribed rest and extra food for the ox, and ordered that the donkey, which was strong and fat, should be yoked to the plow in his place. That evening the merchant stood again by the stable, listening. When the ass came in from plowing, the ox thanked him for his advice, and expressed his intention to act upon it again next morning. ""I don't advise you to do that,"" said the ass, ""if you value your life. Today while I was plowing, your master came and told the plowman to take you to the butcher's tomorrow, as you seemed ailing, and have you killed to save your life. For should you sicken and die, he would lose the value of your carcass."" ""What shall I do?"" cried the ox in terror. ""Be well and strong tomorrow morning,"" said the ass. At that the merchant, unaware that his wife stood near him, laughed aloud, and excited her curiosity. His evasive answers only made her more inquisitive; and when he absolutely refused to satisfy her, she lost her temper, and went to complain of him to her relations, who soon threatened him with a divorce. The poor man, who really loved his wife, in despair resolved to tell her all and die. So he put his affairs in order, made his will, and promised to content her on the morrow. Next morning, at a window overlooking the stable yard, where the cock was gallanting with a number of hens, he heard his watchdog reprove the bird for such light conduct on a day of grief. ""Why! What is the matter?"" inquired the cock. The dog told the story of their master's trouble, when the cock exclaimed, ""Our master is a fool. He cannot keep one wife in order while I have no trouble with twenty. He has only to take a stick and give his mistress a sound thrashing to make her amiable."" These words came as light to the merchant's gloom. Forthwith he called his wife into an inner room, and there chastised her within an inch of her life. And from that hour she gave him no more trouble.",Palestine,"Source: J. E.

The Language of Animals,0670,The Snake's Gift: Language of Animals,"Once upon a time there lived a shepherd who served his master faithfully and honestly. One day whilst keeping the sheep in the forest, he heard a hissing, and wondered what the noise could be. So he went farther into the wood to try and find out. There he saw that the forest was on fire, and a snake was hissing in the midst of the flames. The shepherd watched to see what the snake would do, for it was quite surrounded by the fire, which approached it nearer and nearer. Then the snake cried out, ""For God's sake, good shepherd, save me from the fire!"" So the shepherd stretched his crook across the flames and the snake glided rapidly over the staff and up his arm onto his shoulder, till at last it wound itself round his neck. Then the shepherd was terrified and exclaimed, ""What shall I do? What an unlucky wretch I am! I saved you, and now your are about to kill me!"" The snake answered, ""Do not be afraid. Only take me to the house of my father. My father is the king of snakes."" But the shepherd, being already in great fear, began to excuse himself, saying he must not leave his sheep. Then the snake said, ""Nothing will happen to your sheep. Do not be anxious about them. But let us hurry home."" So the shepherd went on with the snake through the forest, until they came to a gate made entirely of snakes. Then the snake on the neck of the shepherd hissed, and instantly the snakes untwined themselves, so that the man could pass through. As soon as they had gone through, the snake said to him, ""When you reach my father's house he will offer to give you whatever you like -- gold, silver, or precious stones. Do not, however, take any of these things. Choose, instead, the language of animals. He will hesitate at first, but at last he will give it you."" Meanwhile they arrived at the palace, and the king of snakes said, weeping, ""For God's sake, my child, where were you?"" Thereupon the snake told him all that had happened, how he had been surrounded by fire, and the shepherd had saved him. Then the snake king said to the shepherd, ""What do you wish that I should give you for saving my son?"" The shepherd answered, ""I desire nothing but the language of animals."" The snake king, however, said, ""That is not good for you, for if I give it you, and you tell anyone about it, you will instantly die. Therefore it is better that you ask me for something else."" ""If you wish to give me anything,"" replied the shepherd, ""give me the language of animals. If you will not give me that, I want nothing -- so good-bye,"" and he turned to go away. Then the snake king called him back, saying, ""If you indeed wish it so much, take it. Open your mouth."" The shepherd did so, and the snake king blew into his mouth, and said, ""Now blow once yourself in my mouth."" The Shepherd did so, and then the snake king blew again into his mouth, and this they did three times. After that the snake said, ""Now you possess the language of animals. Go, in God's name, but do not for the world tell anyone about it. If you tell anyone you will instantly die."" The shepherd returned across the forest, and, passing through it, he understood everything the birds and animals, and even the plants were saying to each other. When he came to his sheep he found them all there, safe and sound, so he laid himself down to rest a little. Hardly had he done so before two or three ravens settled on a tree near him, and began to converse together, saying, ""If that shepherd only knew that just on the spot where the black sheep is lying there is, deep in the earth, a cave full of gold and silver!"" When the shepherd heard that he went off to his master and told him. The master brought a cart, and dug down to the cave, and carried the treasure away home. But the master was honest, so he gave up the whole of the treasure to the shepherd, saying, ""Here my son, all this wealth belongs to you. For to you God gave it. Build a house, marry, and live upon the treasure."" So the shepherd took the money, built a house, and married, and by and by he became the richest man in the whole neighborhood. He kept his own shepherd, and cattle driver, and swineherd. In short, he had great property and made much money. Once, just at Christmas, he said to his wife, ""Get ready some wine and other food, and tomorrow we will feast the shepherds."" The wife did so, and in the morning they went to their farm. Towards evening the master said to the shepherds, ""Come here, all of you. You shall eat, drink, and make merry together, and I will go myself this night to watch the sheep."" So the master went to watch his sheep, and, about midnight, the wolves began to howl and the dogs to bark. The wolves spoke, in wolf language, ""May we come and take something? You also, shall get a part of the prey."" And the dogs answered, in dog language, ""Come! We also are ready to eat something."" But there was one old dog there who had only two teeth left. This old dog shouted furiously, ""Come on, you miserable wretches, if you dare. So long as I have these two teeth left you shall not do any damage to my master's property."" All this the master heard and understood. Next day he ordered all the dogs to be killed except that old one. The servants began to remonstrate, saying, ""For God's sake, master, it is a pity to do this."" But the master answered, ""Do as I have ordered you,"" and started with his wife to go home. They rode on horseback, he on a fine horse and his wife on a handsome mare. But the master's horse went so fast that the wife remained a little behind. Then the master's horse neighed, and said to the mare, ""Come on, why do you stay behind?"" And the mare answered, ""Ah, to you it is easy -- you are carrying only one weight, and I am carrying three."" Thereupon the man turned his head and laughed. The wife saw him laughing, and urged the mare on quicker till she came up to her husband, and asked him, ""Why were you laughing?"" He said merely, ""I had good reason to laugh!"" But the wife was not satisfied, and again begged he would tell her why he laughed. He excused himself, exclaiming, ""Give up questioning me. What has come to you, my wife? I forget now why it was I laughed."" But the more he refused to tell her, the more she wished to know. At last the man said, ""If I tell you I shall die immediately!"" That, however, did not quiet her, and she kept on asking, saying to him, ""You must tell me."" In the meantime they reached their house. When they had done so the man ordered a coffin to be made, and, when it was ready, had it placed in front of the house, and laid himself down in it. Then he said to his wife, ""Now I will tell you why I laughed, but the moment I tell you I shall die."" So he looked around once more, and saw that the old dog had come from the field, and had taken his stand over his head, and was howling. When the man noticed this he said to his wife, ""Bring a piece of bread for this poor dog."" The wife brought a piece and threw it to the dog, but the dog did not even look at it, and a cock came near and began to peck at it. Then the dog said to the cock, ""You think only about eating. Do you know that our master is going to die?"" And the cock answered, ""Well, let him die, since he is so stupid. I have a hundred wives, and often at nights I gather them all round a grain of corn, and, when they are all there, I pick it up myself. If any of them are angry, I peck them. That is my way of keeping them quiet. Only look at the master, however. He is not able to rule one single wife!"" The man, hearing that, got out of the coffin, took a stick, and called his wife to him, saying, ""Come now, and I will tell you what you want to know."" The wife, seeing she was in danger of getting a beating, left him in peace, and never asked him again why it was he laughed.",Serbia,"Source: Csedomille Mijatovies, Serbian Folk-Lore (London: W.

The Language of Animals,0670,The Wicked Wife,"Now one day he was listening to the animals in his farmyard when one of them said something funny, and he laughed out loud. His wife observed this, and she insisted that he tell her why he had laughed, for she was very curious. He would have liked to tell her, in order to keep her quiet, but he was not allowed to, for it would have cost him his life. Therefore he refused, and she became all the more impatient and angry heaping many curses and accusations upon him and saying that he always kept secrets from her. Thus it continued from one day to the next. This saddened the man so much that he walked around with his head sunk in sorrow trying to think of a way to change the situation.

The Language of Animals,0670,Woman's Curiosity,"One day his donkey said something that made him smile; whereupon his wife commenced to tease him, and wanted to know the joke, but the shepherd was unable to gratify her wish, as his betraying the secret would have immediately been followed by the penalty of sudden death. However the wife would not give in and leave him in peace, but continued to torment her husband with so many questions that he at last determined to die rather than to bear his wife's ill temper any longer. With this view he had his coffin made and brought to his house; he laid down in the coffin quite prepared for death and ready to divulge the secret. His faithful dog sat mournfully by his side watching, while the cock belonging to the house merrily hopped about in the room. The dog remonstrated with the cock and said that this was not the time for merriment, seeing how near their master was to death. But the cock replied quite curtly, ""It's master's own fault! Why is he such a great fool and coward? Look at me! I have fifty wives, and they all do as I tell them to do! If I can get on with so many, surely he ought to be able to manage one!""

The Lion in the Water,0092,Brother Rabbit Conquers Brother Lion,"There was a time when Brer Lion was sort of playing overseer with the other creatures. It seems like he got the idea that all of them had to pay him a toll, because he was the strongest and the most ferocious. He claimed one out of every family: one sheep from the sheep, one goat from the goats, and one from all the kinds. By and by, after a long time, he sent word to Brer Rabbit that his turn had come, and Brer Rabbit sent back word that everything was all right. Of course this made old Mrs. Rabbit and the children feel mighty bad. The children sat around whimpering and sniffling, and old Mrs. Rabbit went about crying and wiping her eyes on her apron. But Brer Rabbit, he sat up and smoked his cigar and told them to quit worrying and to learn how to not be afraid. He said, ""Old woman, if I'm not back by suppertime, just set my vittles down there on the hearth so they'll keep sort of warm."" Old Mrs. Rabbit said that instead of wanting vittles, he'd be vittles himself, and then she sniffled worse and worse. But Brer Rabbit just hooted at her, and then he took down his walking cane and set out to see Brer Lion. The little rabbits hollered out, ""Good-bye, daddy!"" and Brer Rabbit hollered back, ""So long!"" Old Mrs. Rabbit looked after him, she did, and then she flung her apron over her head and just boo-hooed. But Brer Rabbit marched down the road as happy if he were going to a frolic. He marched on, he did, and just before he got to the place where old Brer Lion stayed, he hid his walking cane in the fence corner, rumpled up his hair, and drew himself in until he looked like he wasn't any bigger than a pound of soap after a hard day's washing. Then he went where there was a big, deep spring a little piece away from the road, and he looked at himself in the water. He sort of pulled back his ears and made himself look topsy-turvy, and then he closed one eye and shook his fist at his reflection in the water. He went back to the big road, he did, and crept along like he was ailing -- limping first on one foot and then on the other one, and by and by he came to the place where old Brer Lion was staying. Brer Rabbit sort of dragged himself along and made a bow. Brer Lion looked at him sideways and asked him where he was going. Brer Rabbit said he was all the more willing to come, became it was his turn, and he had been feeling poorly for a long time. He talked mighty weak and trembly. Brer Lion looked at him closely and said, ""You won't make a mouthful. It's time that I eat you. I'm just getting good and hungry."" Brer Rabbit said, ""Yes, sir. I know I'm not fat, and I suspect I have lots of fleas on me, but I'm mighty willing. I've got a bad cough, and I'm tired of being sick. I'm just about as fat as the mule the man had, and he had to tie a knot in its tail to keep it from slipping through the collar."" Brer Lion looked at him and thought that Brer Rabbit was so scared he was talking weaker and weaker. Brer Rabbit said, ""While I was coming along just now I saw a creature that was almost as big and fat as you are, and I said to myself that I wished to goodness that I was as fat as he was, so Brer Lion could have a good dinner."" Brer Lion said, ""Who was he?"" Brer Rabbit said, ""I didn't ask him his name. He refused to respond to my howdy, and he looked so ferocious that I got out of there."" Brer Lion said, ""Come, show me where he is."" Brer Rabbit said, ""I'd do it in a minute, Brer Lion, but I'm afraid he'll hurt you."" Brer Lion sort of bristled up at that. He said, ""Hurt whom? Come on and go with me to where he is, and I'll show you who'll get hurt, and that in short order!"" Brer Rabbit shook his head. He said, ""You'd better eat me, Brer Lion. I'm not much, but I'm something, and that other creature that I saw will surely hurt you. He's got claws and he's got teeth, because I saw them. Don't go where he is, Brer Lion, if you have any friendly feelings for your family. That creature will surely cripple you!"" This made Brer Lion mighty mad. He said, ""Get right into the road and show me where he is!"" Brer Rabbit said, ""Well, if I need to go, Brer Lion, I'll go. I told you so, and that's all I can do."" They went on, they did, and Brer Rabbit took Brer Lion to the spring. When they got there, Brer Rabbit looked around and said, ""He was right around here somewhere, and he's not so mighty far off now, because I feel it in my bones."" Then he crept up, he did, and looked into the spring. As he did this, he let out a yell and jumped back. ""Ouch, Brer Lion! He's in there! Let's run! He'll get us for sure!"" Brer Lion walked up to the spring and looked in. Sure enough, there was a big creature looking back at him. Brer Lion hollered at him. The creature in the spring didn't say anything. Brer Lion shook his head. The creature shook his. Brer Lion showed his teeth. The creature grinned at him. They kept on this way until by and by Brer Lion got so mad that he jumped into the spring head foremost. When he was in there, he couldn't get out again, and so there he was, strangled with water and drowned for the want of sense and breath. Brer Rabbit capered around there some little time, and then he put out for home, and when he got there, he took his children on his knee and told them a mighty tale about how he made out with old Brer Lion.",African American,"Source: Joel Chandler Harris, Uncle Remus and His Friends: Old Plantation Stories, Songs, and Ballads with Sketches of Negro Character (Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Company, 1892), no. 18, pp. 134-41.",NA,Dialect normalized by D.

The Lion in the Water,0092,Lion Brooks No Rival,"So finally he came across a well. The thought came to him as he looked into the well, he saw his shader, he had a scheme to fool the lion. He had been told by the other animals that any way he could get rid of the lion, they would pay him, give him praise of being the wisest animal of the forest. He entered the lion's room pretendin' he had been runnin', doin' all he could to get there on time. The lion asked him why he was so late. The rabbit began to tell him the story why he was so late. So he tol' the lion, if he didn' believe what he had tol' him, to follow him, and he would show him. So the lion went with the rabbit to the well. The rabbit tol' the lion to get up on the curb of the well and look down into the well, and he would see what had delayed him. So he did. When he looked into the water, he saw another face, not knowing that it was himself. He frowned, he grit his teeth, and the other lion did the same thing. The lion on top, thinking that he was master of all the beasts of the forest, jumped into the well, and that was the last of the lion. And the rabbit got the praise of being the wisest beast of the forest. Return to D. L.

The Lion in the Water,0092,Singh Rajah and the Cunning Little Jackals,"Once upon a time, in a great jungle, there lived a great lion. He was rajah of all the country round; and every day he used to leave his den, in the deepest shadow of the rocks, and roar with a loud, angry voice. And when he roared, the other animals in the jungle, who were all his subjects, got very much frightened, and ran here and there. And Singh Rajah [Lion King] would pounce upon them, and kill them, and gobble them up for his dinner. This went on for a long, long time, until, at last, there were no living creatures left in the jungle but two little jackals, a rajah jackal and a ranee jackal, husband and wife. A very hard time of it the poor little jackals had, running this way and that to escape the terrible Singh Rajah. And every day the little ranee jackal would say to her husband, ""I am afraid he will catch us today. Do you hear how he is roaring? Oh dear, oh dear!"" And he would answer her, ""Never fear. I will take care of you. Let us run on a mile or two. Come, come, -- quick, quick, quick!"" And they would both run away as fast as they could. After some time spent in this way, they found, however, one fine day, that the lion was so close upon them that they could not escape. Then the little ranee jackal said, ""Husband, husband! I feel very frightened. The Singh Rajah is so angry he will certainly kill us at once. What can we do?"" But he answered, ""Cheer up. We can save ourselves yet. Come, and I'll show you how we may manage it."" So what did these cunning little jackals do, but they went to the great lion's den; and when he saw them coming, he began to roar and shake his mane, and he said, ""You little wretches, come and be eaten at once! I have had no dinner for three whole days, and all that time I have been running over hill and dale to find you. Ro-a-ar! Ro-a-ar! Come and be eaten, I say!"" And he lashed his tail and gnashed his teeth, and looked very terrible indeed. Then the jackal rajah, creeping quite close up to him, said, ""O great Singh Rajah, we all know you are our master, and we would have come at your bidding long ago; but indeed, sir, there is a much bigger rajah even than you in this jungle, and he tried to catch hold of us and eat us up, and frightened us so much that we were obliged to run away."" ""What do you mean?"" growled Singh Rajah. ""There is no king in this jungle but me!"" ""Ah, sire,"" answered the jackal, ""in truth one would think so, for you are very dreadful. Your very voice is death. But it is as we say, for we, with our own eyes, have seen one with whom you could not compete; whose equal you can no more be than we are yours; whose face is as flaming fire, his step as thunder, and his power supreme."" ""It is impossible!"" interrupted the old lion. ""But show me this rajah of whom you speak so much, that I may destroy him instantly!"" Then the little jackals ran on before him until they reached a great well, and, pointing down to his own reflection in the water, they said, ""See, sire, there lives the terrible king of whom we spoke."" When Singh Rajah looked down the well he became very angry, for he thought he saw another lion there. He roared and shook his great mane, and the shadow lion shook his, and looked terribly defiant. At last, beside himself with rage at the insolence of his opponent, Singh Rajah sprang down to kill him at once, but no other lion was there -- only the treacherous reflection. And the sides of the well were so steep that he could not get out again, to punish the two jackals, who peeped over the top. After struggling for some time in the deep water, he sank to rise no more. And the little jackals threw stones down upon him from above, and danced round and round the well, singing, ""Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao! The king of the forest is dead, is dead. We have killed the great lion who would have killed us! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ring-a-ting -- ding-a-ting! Ring-a-ting -- ding-a-ting! Ao! Ao!

The Lion in the Water,0092,The Hare and the Lions,"It chanced one day that while the lion was hunting for something to eat, he came across a hare sleeping behind a boulder; and seizing the hare in his great paws he was just about to devour him, when the hare spoke as follows: ""Oh! Uncle Lion,"" said he, ""before eating me I just want to tell you about another animal who lives in that pond down there in the valley. He is very big and fierce, and I think he must be even stronger than you are. But if you will allow me to do so I will show you where he lives, and if you can succeed in killing him, he will make a very much better meal for you than a poor little beast like me."" On hearing this the lion was very indignant. ""What!"" said he, ""do you mean to tell me that there is any animal in this country stronger and more powerful than I am? Don't you know that I am the lord of this district, and that I should never allow anyone else to dispute the mastery with me. Show me at once where this creature lives, and I will show you how I shall deal with him."" ""Oh! Uncle Lion,"" said the hare, ""let me beg you to be careful. You have no idea what a big, strong creature this is; you must on no account allow yourself to be injured by fighting with him. Think what a grief it would be to us all if you were to come to any harm."" This remark of the hare's made the lion more angry than before, and he insisted that the hare should at once lead him down and show him where the other animal lived. So the hare, after again begging him to be careful of himself, preceded him down the hill until they arrived at the edge of a square-built stone tank, which was nearly full of water. ""Now, Uncle Lion,"" said the hare, ""if you will go to the edge of that tank and look down into the water you will see the animal I speak of."" So saying he moved on one side, and the lion, stalking to the edge, peered down into the tank. The water was very smooth, and on the clear surface he saw his own head reflected. ""There he is,"" called out the hare from the background; ""there he is, Uncle Lion, I can see him quite plainly in the water. You see how fierce he is looking; please be careful not to start fighting with him."" These remarks made the lion more angry than ever, and he moved up and down on the brink of the tank, glaring fiercely at his own reflection in the water, and growling and showing his teeth at it. ""That's right, Uncle Lion,"" called out the hare; ""I am so glad you are taking good care of yourself. Don't on any account come to grips with that beast in the water, or he might do you an injury. You are certainly much safer on the bank, and no doubt you will frighten him if you continue to growl and show your teeth."" These last observations of the hare goaded the lion to desperation, and with a fierce roar he sprang straight at the image in the water. Once in the tank he was unable to get out, for its sides were built of masonry, and it was impossible for him to climb them. So he swam about for some time in the tank, whilst the hare, sitting on the bank, threw stones at him and made nasty remarks; and finally, when quite wearied out, he sank to the bottom and was drowned. The hare was very pleased at having accomplished the destruction of the lion, and he now turned his attention to the lioness. It happened that nearby there was a thick wall standing, which was part of the remains of a ruined castle; and in one portion of the wall there was a hole, very large at one end and tapering down to quite a small opening at the other. The hare, having studied his ground, went off next morning to find the lioness. He soon came across her stalking up and down near her den, very much perturbed at the disappearance of her lord and master. ""Good-morning, Aunt Lioness,"" said the hare, going up cautiously towards her; ""what is the matter with you this morning? How is it I find you pacing here in front of your den instead of hunting your prey as usual on the hillside?"" The lioness took no notice of the hare, except to growl at him in an angry manner, and to lash her sides with her tail. ""I suppose,"" went on the hare, ""you are anxious about Mr. Lion, but I am sorry to tell you that you are not likely to see him again for some time. The fact is, he and I had a little argument yesterday, in which we both lost our tempers. It ended in our having a free fight, and I regret to say that I was obliged to injure Mr. Lion rather severely before I could make him see reason, and he is now lying in a dying state in the valley below."" This impudence so enraged the lioness that she sprang towards the hare and endeavoured to seize him; but he eluded her and galloped off down the hill hotly pursued by the angry beast. The hare made straight for the ruined wall, and entering the breach in the wall at the large end he emerged safely at the other side by the smaller recess, which was just large enough for him to pass through. The lioness, following closely at his heels, was so blind with rage that she did not see that she was being led into a trap; so she rushed head-foremost into the opening in the wall, and before she had time to stop herself was wedged tightly in the tapering hole. She struggled violently, trying to extricate herself, but all in vain. Meanwhile the hare, having cantered round to the other side, took up its position in rear of the lioness, and began pelting her with stones and calling her all the bad names he could think of. When he was tired of this he went off home very pleased with himself, and the lioness, being unable to free herself from the trap she was in, shortly afterwards starved to death.",Tibet,"Source: W.

The Lion in the Water,0092,The Killing of the Rakhas,"The villagers turned on him, ""Why don't you go and do so: then you would marry the Raja's daughter and we should all bow down to you."" At the thought of this Jhalka began to skip about crying, ""I will finish him off in no time."" The headman heard him and took him at his word and wrote to the Raja that in his village there was a man who undertook to kill the Rakhas. When Jhalka heard this he hurried to the headman and explained that he had only been joking. ""I cannot treat such things as a joke,"" answered the headman. ""Don't you know that this is a Raja's matter: to deal with Rajas is the same as to deal with bongas: you may make a promise to the bongas in jest, but they will not let you off it on that plea. You are much too fond of playing the fool."" Ten or twelve days later sipahis came from the Raja to fetch Jhalka: he told them that he had only spoken in jest and did not want to go to the Raja, but they took him away all the same. Before he started he picked out a well-tempered battle axe and begged his father to propitiate the bongas and pray that he might be saved from the Rakhas. When he was produced before the Raja, Jhalka again tried to explain that there had been a mistake, but the Raja told him that he would be taken at his word and must go and kill the Rakhas. Then he saw that there was nothing left for him but to put his trust in God: so he asked that he might be given two mirrors and a large box and when these were brought he had the box taken to the foot of a large banyan tree which grew by a ford in the river which flowed by the hill in which the Rakhas lived: it was at this ford that the Rakhas used to lie in wait for prey. Left alone there Jhalka put one of the mirrors into the box and then tightened his cloth and climbed the banyan tree with his battle axe and the other mirror. He was not at all happy as he waited for the Rahkas, thinking of all the people who had been killed as they passed along the road below the tree: however he was determined to outwit the Rakhas if he could. All night long he watched in vain but just at dawn the Rakhas appeared. At the sight of him Jhalka shook so much with fright that the branches of the tree swayed. The Rakhas smelt that there was a human being about and looking up into the tree saw the branches waving. ""Ha,"" said he, ""here is my breakfast."" Jhalka retorted ""Ha! here is another Rakhas to match those I have got."" ""What are you talking about?"" asked the Rakhas. ""I am glad to have met you at last"" returned Jhalka. ""Why?"" asked the Rakhas, ""and what are you trembling for?"" ""I am trembling with rage: we shall now see whether I am to eat you or you are to eat me."" ""Come down and try."" ""No, you come up here and try."" Jhalka would not leave the tree, and the Rakhas would not climb it: so they waited. At last the Rahhas asked, ""Who are you? I have seen a thousand men like you."" And Jhalka answered, ""Who are you? I have seen a thousand like you."" At this the Rakhas began to hesitate and wonder whether Jhalka was really his equal in strength, so he changed the subject and asked what the big box was. ""That is the box into which I put Rakhases like you when I catch them; I have got plenty more at home."" ""How many are there in the box?"" ""Two or three."" The Rakhas asked to see them, but Jhalka would not leave the tree until the Rakhas had sworn an oath to do him no harm; then he came down and opened the box and made the Rakhas look into the mirror inside the box; and he also held up the second mirror saying that there was another Rakhas. The Rakhas was fascinated at the sight of his own reflection; when he grinned or opened his mouth the reflection did the same; and while he was amusing himself with making different grimaces Jhalka suddenly cut him down with the battle axe, and he fell down dead. Then Jhalka cut off the ears and tongue and toes and hastened with them to the Raja. When it was found that the Rakhas was really dead the Raja assembled all his subjects and in their presence married Jhalka to his daughter and made over to him half the kingdom and gave him horses and elephants and half of everything in his palace.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 95, pp. 286-89.",NA,NA
The Lion in the Water,0092,The Lion and the Hare,"In the middle of a forest there lived a lion by the name of Bhâsuraka (Heroic One). In consequence of his great strength he unceasingly killed many gazelles, hares, and other animals. One day all the forest creatures assembled. Gazelles, boars, buffalo, wild oxen, hares, and so forth, went to him and said, ""Sir, why are you unnecessarily murdering all the wild animals, when one animal would be sufficient to fill you? Therefore enter into an agreement with us. From this day forth you may sit here quietly, and every day one animal will come to you, as his turn comes up, and allow you to eat him. In this manner you can effortlessly acquire your nourishment, and we will not be wholly exterminated. That is the right of a king, and let it thus be carried out."" After hearing their words, Bhâsuraka said, ""What you say is true. But if ever an animal fails to come to me here, then I will surely devour all of you."" They sealed their promise with the words, ""So be it!"" and now, free of danger, they moved fearlessly about the forest. However, every day, in turn, one animal came to the lion: an old one, one who had renounced all earthly affairs, one who was torn by grief, or one who feared he might lose his wife and children. One animal presented himself to the lion every noon to serve as his meal. Following the predetermined order, it became the hare's turn, and however little he liked it, he was sent to the lion by the other animals. He walked as slowly as possible and thus missed the established deadline. With a fearful heart he sought a way to escape death. Toward the end of the day he finally arrived. The lion, famished from his long wait, was filled with anger. Licking the corners of his mouth, he thought, ""Aha! Tomorrow I shall kill all the creatures in the forest."" Just as he was thinking this the hare walked up, bowed, and stood before him. When the lion saw that this creature, who otherwise was so light-footed, was the one who had arrived so late, he was filled with anger and spoke threateningly, ""Hey, you miserable little hare. It had to be you who come so long after the appointed time, you who otherwise are the most light-footed of them all! Because of your failure, after I have killed you, tomorrow I am going to exterminate all the rest of the animals."" To this the hare bowed and spoke humbly, ""Sir, it is neither my fault nor the fault of the other animals. Would you like to hear the cause of my tardiness?"" The lion said, ""Speak quickly, before you find yourself between my teeth!"" The hare said, ""Sir, after learning from the other animals that today was my turn, I was sent away with four hares. On my way here I was approached by another large lion, who came from his den and said to me, 'Hey there! Where are you going? Pay homage to your guardian angel!' I answered, 'We are going, in keeping with our contract, to our lord Bhâsuraka, in order to serve as his meal.' To that he said, 'If that is so, then all of the animals must also enter into a contract with me, because this forest belongs to me. This Bhâsuraka is a miserable thief. But if he is king here, then leave the four hares here as hostages, and demand that he come here as quickly as possible, so that the one of us who can prove himself king through his strength will be able to eat all the animals here.' Then following his order I came here. That is the reason why I am late. Now your order is my command!"" Having heard this, Bhâsuraka said, ""My dear, if this is the case then quickly show me this rogue of a lion so I can vent my anger against the other animals on him and become myself once again."" The hare said, ""Sir, you are right. We warriors go to battle to protect our homeland and to fight against evil. This enemy lives in a castle. If he attacks us from his castle, we'll be threatened, but if he stays in his castle, he'll be difficult to overcome."" Bhâsuraka answered, ""My dear, lead me to this rogue. Even if he is in a castle, I will kill him."" The hare said, ""But I have seen that he is very powerful. Sir, it is not good for you to go without knowing his strength."" Bhâsuraka said, ""Ha! What is this to you? Lead me to him, even if he does live in a castle."" The hare said, ""If you insist, come with me, sir."" After saying this he set forth and went to a well. There he said to Bhâsuraka, ""Sir, who is able to withstand your majesty? This rogue saw you coming from afar and has retreated into his castle. Come here and I will show him to you."" After hearing this Bhâsuraka said, ""My dear, show me his castle at once!"" Then the hare showed him the well. The foolish lion, seeing his own reflection in the middle of the well, roared fiercely. A doubly loud roar echoed up from within the well. Hearing this, he thought, ""He is very powerful,"" and he threw himself on him, and thus he lost his life. The hare, on the other hand, after having cheerfully reported back to the other animals, was greatly praised by them, and he lived happily in the forest. One of India's most influential contributions to world literature, The Panchatantra (also spelled Pañcatantra or Pañca-tantra) consists of five books of animal fables and magic tales (some 87 stories in all) that were compiled in their current form between the third and fifth centuries AD. It is believed that even then the stories were already ancient. The tales' self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes The Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning ""court scholar."" The fables of The Panchatantra found their way to Europe through oral folklore channels and by way of Persian and Arabic translations. They substantially influenced medieval writers of fables. In the neighborhood of Baghdad there was a beautiful meadow, which was the home of many wild animals. They would have lived very happily there had it not been for one mischief-loving lion. Every day this lion wandered about, killing many helpless creatures for the mere sport of the slaying. To put an end to this, the animals gathered in a body, and going to the lion, spoke to him in this manner, ""King lion, we are proud to have such a brave and valiant beast to rule over us. But we do not think that it is fitting for one of your rank to hunt for his own food. We therefore wait upon you with this request: Henceforth do you remain quietly at home, and we your subjects will bring to your lair such food as it is fitting that a king should eat."" The lion, who was greatly flattered, immediately accepted their offer. Thus every day the animals drew lots to decide who among their number should offer himself for the lion's daily portion. In due time it came about that the lot fell upon the hare. Now the hare, when he learned that it was his turn to die, complained bitterly. ""Do you not see that we are still tormented by that lion?"" he asked the other animals. ""Only leave it to me, and I will release you for all time from his tyranny."" The other animals were only too glad at these words, and told the hare to go his way. The hare hid for some time in the bushes, and then hurried to the lion's lair. By this time the lion was as angry as he was hungry. He was snarling, and lashing his yellow tail on the ground. When he saw the hare, he called out loudly, ""Who are you, and what are my subjects doing? I have had no morsel of food today!"" The hare besought him to calm his anger and listen to him. ""The lot fell today,"" he began, ""on another hare and myself. In good season we were on our way here to offer ourselves for your dinner, when a lion sprang out of the bushes and seized my companion. In vain I cried to him that we were destined for the king's table, and, moreover, that no one was permitted to hunt in these royal woods except your majesty. He paid no heed to my words save to retort, 'You do not know what you are saying. I am the only king here. That other lion, to whom you all bow down, is a usurper.' Dumb with fright, I jumped into the nearest bush."" The lion grew more and more indignant as he listened to the hare's tale. ""If I could once find that lion,"" he roared, ""I would soon teach him who is king of these woods."" ""If your majesty will trust me,"" answered the hare, humbly, ""I can take you to his hiding place."" So the hare and the lion went out together. They crossed the woods and the meadow, and came to an ancient well, which was full of clear, deep water. ""Yonder is the home of your enemy,"" whispered the hare, pointing to the well. ""If you go near enough, you can see him. But,"" he added, ""perhaps you had better wait until he comes out before you attack him."" These words only made the lion more indignant. ""He shall not live a moment after I have laid eyes upon him,"" he growled. So the hare and the lion approached stealthily to the well. As they bent over the edge and looked down into the clear water, they saw themselves reflected there. The lion, thinking that it was the other lion with the other hare, leaped into the well, never to come out again. The hare said, ""Uncle Lion, I know I am late, and you have cause to be angry. But really it is not my fault. There is another lion in our part of the jungle, and he says that he is master, and you are nobody. In fact, when I showed him that I positively would come to you he was very angry."" ""Ha!"" said the lion, roaring. ""Who says he is my master? Show him to me. I'll teach him who rules the forest."" ""Come along then,"" said the hare. They went a long way, until they came to a well. The hare looked down into the well. ""He was here just now,"" said he. The Lion looked in, and at the bottom he saw what looked like a lion in the water. He shook his mane -- the other lion shook his mane. He roared -- the echo of a roar came up from the bottom of the well. ""Let me get at him!"" roared the lion. In he jumped -- splash! Nothing more was ever heard of that lion, and the beasts of the forest were glad to be left in peace. They put their heads together, and composed a verse of poetry, which is always sung in that forest on Sundays:","India, The Panchatantra Bidpai India","Source: The Panchatantra, book 1.

The Lion in the Water,0092,The Lion Whose Name Was Pingala,"At last a hare's turn came to satisfy the lion's hunger and he declined to carry out the agreement. The other animals remonstrated with him and said: ""You must go, or we shall have the lion eating up all the beasts as he used to do."" The hare replied: ""Don't trouble yourselves! He won't eat up many more."" So at about midday he appeared before the lion, going very slowly, and said: ""Sir! I was travelling along the road to come to you, when I was seized and kept a prisoner by one of your enemies; so I am afraid I am a little late!"" ""One of my enemies!"" exclaimed the lion. ""And pray where is he? Let me see him at once."" The cunning hare led the lion into an enclosure where there was a well, and looking down into the water the lion saw his own reflection. The foolish lion thereupon in a great rage jumped down into the water and was drowned.

The Lion in the Water,0092,The Tiger and the Fox,"In a certain wood, where dwelt many jackals and foxes, a tiger came and took up his abode. And what did he do? This is what he used to do. Every day he would kill a jackal or two. So the jackals and foxes gathered together, and said, ""If he goes on this way he will destroy us all, so, as we are now assembled here, let us agree that each will take his turn to be devoured."" And so they did. Every day they used to give to the tiger the one whose turn it was. One day it was a fox's turn. At first he hid himself, but then he thought, ""Now I have to go, for I am hemmed in on both sides. I'll go, but I'll try by some trick to keep my breath in me."" So on he went, shivering as he went, till he came to the tiger's presence. ""Ah!"" says the tiger, ""You fox, why have you been so long?"" ""Sire,"" said the fox, ""another tiger has come to live in your country."" ""Where is that tiger?"" said the tiger. ""Come with me,"" said the fox, ""and I will show him to you."" So the fox went in front and the tiger went behind, and they went on till they came to a well. They came and stood at the mouth of the well, and then the fox said, ""Oh, my lord tiger! That other tiger has just come home after feeding on a jackal, and he is now sitting inside this well."" Then the tiger said, ""What kind of tiger can he be to come to my country! Either I must stay here alone, or he can stay alone, but we cannot live together."" Then he went up to the well and looked in, and saw a tiger sitting there. But really it was only his own shadow [reflection], and no tiger. With that he leapt into the well, and there was drowned and perished. Then the fox went back to his home, jumping for joy as he went. He called out to his brethren, ""Come here, foxes and jackals!"" They came up at his call, and were very angry, and said, ""You fox, it was your turn to be eaten by the tiger! Why have you come back? Now the tiger will be in a rage and will come and kill two or three jackals and two or three foxes."" But the fox answered them, ""Don't you be afraid. I have killed that tiger."" They all said, ""You are a fox, and he is a tiger. How then could you kill him?"" He said, ""Come, and I'll show him to you."" They set out in great fear after the fox, and trembling with fright, they came and stoood at the mouth of the well. The fox gave a shout and said, ""Come and see how I have slain the tiger and cast him into this well."" They peeped in, and said that it was the truth, and that the tiger was lying dead in the well. And they all rejoiced exceedingly.",Pakistan,"Source: M.

The Lion in the Water,0092,The Tiger and the Hare,"In a certain forest there once lived a fierce tiger, which was in the habit of hunting down the rest of the animals for mere sport, whether hunger impelled him thereto or not. All the animals, therefore, met together by common consent to consider their grievances. ""Let us agree,"" said the jackal, ""that one of us shall be chosen by lot day by day as a sacrifice to the tiger."" ""All right,"" assented the others, ""but first let us see the tiger, and let us offer him a petition."" So they all marched together to the tiger's den and humbly sought him to refrain from indiscriminate slaughter, and to be satisfied with the animal which should voluntarily come to him day by day. ""Do not hunt us poor fellows down,"" said they, ""for one of us will always come to be devoured by you, and this plan will save you trouble as well."" ""No, no,"" cried the tiger. ""I shall use my claws and my teeth, and so eat my food."" ""But,"" answered the animals, ""God has said that we ought to live in hope."" ""True,"" answered the tiger, ""but he has also bidden everyone to earn his own bread."" At last, after much argument, the tiger suffered himself to be persuaded, and made a solemn promise to remain at home in his den. Thenceforward every day an animal chosen by lot went to the den to be eaten. But when the hare's turn came, she flatly said, ""I shall not go. I shall live my life."" In vain the other animals tried to persuade or coerce her. Twelve o'clock, the tiger's usual feeding time, came and went, then came one, two, and three. At last the hare suddenly started up, and exclaiming ""Now I'm off!"" she set out for the den. As she drew near she noticed the famished tiger tearing up the earth in fury, and heard him bellowing, ""Who is this ridiculous hare to keep me waiting?"" ""But I have an excuse,"" protested the hare. ""What excuse can you have?"" demanded the tiger. ""Today,"" said the hare, ""it was not my turn to come at all. It was my brother's. I am thin, but my brother is plump and fat. My brother had started for your den, but on the way he fell in with another tiger which wanted to eat him, and, in fact, he caught him and was carrying him away, when I came up and said to him, 'This country is not your country, but the country of another tiger who will punish you.' To which the strange tiger answered, 'You go at once and call that tiger of yours out, and then he and I shall have a fight.' So here I am, sir, sent to deliver his challenge. Come and kill the villain for us."" Full of rage and jealousy, the tiger said to the hare, ""Lead on!"" and the pair started forth to seek the rival tiger. As they went along, the hare began to look alarmed and shrink back, and made as though she would have hidden herself in a thicket. ""What is the matter now?"" inquired the tiger. ""What are you afraid of?"" ""I am afraid,"" answered she, ""because the other tiger's den lies close in front of us."" ""Where? Where?"" cried the tiger, peering forward with searching eyes. ""I see no den whatever."" ""It is there. See!"" answered the hare. ""Almost at your very feet!"" ""I can see no den,"" said the tiger. ""Is there no means of persuading you to come forward and show me the place?"" ""Yes,"" replied the hare, ""if you will please carry me under your arm."" So the tiger lifted the cunning hare under his arm, and, guided by her directions, he unexpectedly found himself at the edge of a large deep well. ""The is the den I told you of,"" whispered the hare. ""Look in and you will see the robber."" Standing on the brink and looking down into the clear depths, the tiger saw at the bottom the reflected image of himself and the hare, and imagining that he saw his enemy in proud possession of the fat brother, he dropped the nimble hare, which easily escaped, and with a roar leaped down, where, after struggling in the water for many hours, he finally expired, and thus the forest was at last rid of the tyrant.",Pakistan,"Source: Charles Swynnerton, Indian Nights' Entertainment; or, Folk-Tales from the Upper Indus (London: Elliot Stock, 1892), no. 3, pp. 4-6.",NA,NA
The Lion in the Water,0092,The Tiger and the Shadow,"There was a saltlick in the jungle to which all the beasts of the forest resorted, but they were greatly afraid by reason of an old tiger which killed one of them every day. At length, therefore, Plando the mouse-deer said to the tiger, ""Why not permit me to bring you a beast every day, to save you from hunting for your food?"" The tiger consented, and Plando went off to make arrangement with the beasts. But he could not persuade any of them to go, and after three days he set off, taking nobody with him but Kuwis the smallest of the flying squirrels. On their arrival Plando said to the tiger, ""I could not bring you any of the other beasts because the way was blocked by a fat old tiger with a flying squirrel sitting astride its muzzle."" On hearing this the tiger exclaimed, ""Let us go and find it and drive it away."" The three therefore set out, the flying squirrel perched upon the tiger's muzzle and the mouse-deer sitting astride upon its hind quarters. On reaching the river, the mouse-deer pointed to the tiger's likeness in the water and exclaimed, ""Look there! That is the fat old tiger that I saw."" On hearing this, the tiger sprang into the river to attack his own shadow [reflection], and was drowned immediately.",Malaya,"Source: Walter Skeat, Fables and Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901), pp. 28-29.","Skeat's source: ""This tale is from Ulu Kedah.""

The Sick Lion,0050,The Hyena Outwitted,"In his agony he sent for a hyena and offered to make him his dewan [chief minister], if only he would call all the other animals of the forest to come and pay a farewell visit to their lord. The hyena readily agreed but thought it would be better to send another messenger, while he stayed by the tiger to see that all the animals duly presented themselves. Just then a crow flew overhead; so they called him and deputed him to summon all the animals. The crow flew off and in a short time all the animals assembled before the tiger and paid their respects to him and expressed wishes for his speedy recovery -- all except the jackals. They had been summoned along with the others; but somehow they paid no attention and only remembered about it in the afternoon. Then they were very frightened as to what would be the consequence of their remissness; but one chief jackal stood up and told them not to fear, as he would contrive a way of getting the better of the hyena. There was nothing else to be done, so they had to put what trust they could in their chief and follow him to the tiger. On his way the chief jackal picked up a few roots, and took them with him. When they reached the place where the suffering monarch lay, the hyena at once began to abuse them for being late, and the tiger also angrily asked why they had not come before; then the chief jackal began humbly ""O Maharaja, we were duly summoned; your messenger is not to blame; but we reflected that it was useless merely to go and look at you when you were so ill: that could do you no good; so we bestirred ourselves to try and find some medicine that would cure you. We have searched the length and breadth of the jungle and have found all that is necessary, except one thing and that we have failed to find."" ""Tell me what it is,"" said the hyena, ""and I will at once dispatch all these animals to look for it and it will surely be found."" ""Yes,"" echoed the tiger, ""what is it?"" ""Maharaja,"" said the jackal, ""when you take these medicines, you must lie down on the fresh skin of a hyena, which has been flayed alive; but the only hyena we can find in the forest is your dewan"" ""The world can well bear the loss of one hyena,"" said the tiger: ""take him and skin him."" At these words all the animals set upon the hyena and flayed him alive; and the tiger lay down on the skin and took the medicines brought by the jackal; and as he was not seriously ill, his pain soon began to pass away. ""That is a lesson to the hyena not to scold us and get us into trouble,"" said the jackal, as he went home.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 119, pp. 335-36.",NA,NA
The Sick Lion,0050,The King of the Tigers Is Sick,"When the great king of all the tigers was sick, the tiger crown prince made obeisance and said, ""If my lord will taste of the flesh of every beast of the field peradventure my lord may recover."" To the great king commanded the crown prince to summon every kind of beast into his presence, and as they appeared, the king ate them. Only the mouse-deer, who was likewise summoned, refused to appear. Therefore the great king's wrath was kindled against the mouse-deer, and in the end he too was fain to appear. And when he appeared he was questioned by the king, ""Why did you not attend at the first when we had summoned hither every kind of beast that lives in the field?"" The mouse-deer replied, ""Your slave could not approach your majesty because of a dream of certain medicine that would make your majesty well."" The king replied, ""What medicine was this of which you dreamed?"" ""Your slave dreamed that the only remedy for you majesty's sickness was for you majesty to seize and devour that which is nearest your majesty."" Immediately on hearing this, the great king of the tigers seized the prince of the tigers and devoured him also.

The wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the fox, so he called the attention of the lion to his absence, and said, ""You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."" Just then the fox came in and heard the last words of the wolf. The lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, ""Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."" ""And may I ask if you have found one?"" said the lion. ""I have, sire,"" said the fox, ""and it is this: You must flay a wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."" The lion accordingly turned to the wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the fox's prescription. But the fox laughed and said to himself, ""That's what comes of stirring ill-will.""",Aesop,"Source: Æsop's Fables, translated by V. S. Vernon Jones (London: W. Heinemann, 1912), pp. 293- 294.",NA,NA
Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert,0178a,Beth Gellert,"Prince Llewellyn had a favorite greyhound named Gellert that had been given to him by his father-in-law, King John. He was as gentle as a lamb at home but a lion in the chase. One day Llewellyn went to the chase and blew his horn in front of his castle. All his other dogs came to the call but Gellert never answered it. So he blew a louder blast on his horn and called Gellert by name, but still the greyhound did not come. At last Prince Llewellyn could wait no longer and went off to the hunt without Gellert. He had little sport that day because Gellert was not there, the swiftest and boldest of his hounds. He turned back in a rage to his castle, and as he came to the gate, who should he see but Gellert come bounding out to meet him. But when the hound came near him, the prince was startled to see that his lips and fangs were dripping with blood. Llewellyn started back and the greyhound crouched down at his feet as if surprised or afraid at the way his master greeted him. Now Prince Llewellyn had a little son a year old with whom Gellert used to play, and a terrible thought crossed the prince's mind that made him rush towards the child's nursery. And the nearer he came the more blood and disorder he found about the rooms. He rushed into it and found the child's cradle overturned and daubed with blood. Prince Llewellyn grew more and more terrified, and sought for his little son everywhere. He could find him nowhere but only signs of some terrible conflict in which much blood had been shed. At last he felt sure the dog had destroyed his child, and shouting to Gellert, ""Monster, thou hast devoured my child,"" he drew out his sword and plunged it in the greyhound's side, who fell with a deep yell and still gazing in his master's eyes. As Gellert raised his dying yell, a little child's cry answered it from beneath the cradle, and there Llewellyn found his child unharmed and just awakened from sleep. But just beside him lay the body of a great gaunt wolf all torn to pieces and covered with blood. Too late, Llewellyn learned what had happened while he was away. Gellert had stayed behind to guard the child and had fought and slain the wolf that had tried to destroy Llewellyn's heir. In vain was all Llewellyn's grief; he could not bring his faithful dog to life again. So he buried him outside the castle walls within sight of the great mountain of Snowdon, where every passerby might see his grave, and raised over it a great cairn of stones.

Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert,0178a,Folliculus and His Greyhound,"Folliculus, a knight, was fond of hunting and tournaments. He had an only son, for whom three nurses were provided. Next to this child he loved his falcon and his greyhound. It happened one day that he was called to a tournament, whither his wife and domestics went also, leaving the child in the cradle, the greyhound lying by him, and the falcon on his perch. A serpent that inhabited a hole near the castle, taking advantage of the profound silence that reigned, crept from his habitation and advanced towards the cradle to devour the child. The falcon, perceiving the danger, fluttered with his wings till he awoke the dog, who instantly attacked the invader, and after a fierce conflict, in which he was sorely wounded, killed him. He then lay down on the ground to lick and heal his wounds. When the nurses returned they found the cradle overturned, the child thrown out, and the ground covered with blood, as well as the dog, who, they immediately concluded, had killed the child. Terrified at the idea of meeting the anger of the parents, they determined to escape, but in their flight fell in with their mistress, to whom they were compelled to relate the supposed murder of the child by the greyhound. The knight soon arrived to hear the sad story, and, maddened with fury, rushed forward to the spot. The poor wounded and faithful animal made an effort to rise, and welcome his master with his accustomed fondness; but the enraged knight received him on the point of his sword, and he fell lifeless to the ground. On examination of the cradle the infant was found alive and unhurt, and the dead serpent lying by him. the knight now perceived what had happened, lamented bitterly over his faithful dog, and blamed himself for having depended too hastily on the words of his wife. Abandoning the profession of arms, he broke his lance in three pieces, and vowed a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he spent the rest of his days in peace.","England, Gesta Romanorum","Source: Gesta Romanorum, translated from the Latin by Charles Swan; revised and corrected by Wynnard Hooper (London: George Bell and Sons, 1906), notes to chapter 32, pp. xlii-xliii.","The Gesta Romanorum or Deeds of the Romans was compiled in Latin in the early fourteenth century by an English cleric.

Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert,0178a,The Brahman's Wife and the Mongoose,"In a certain city there lived a Brahman by the name of Devasarman. His wife gave birth to a son, and then to a mongoose. Full of love for her children, she cared for the mongoose like a son, nursing him at her breast, rubbing him with salve, and so forth. However, she did not trust him, thinking that in keeping with the evil nature of his species he might harm her son. As is rightly said: And as also is said: One day, after nicely tucking the boy into his bed, she took the water pitcher and said to her husband, ""Listen, master, I am going to the pond to fetch water. You must protect our son from the mongoose."" After she departed, the Brahman went off somewhere to collect alms, leaving the house empty. In the meantime a black snake crept out of its hole and -- as fate would have it -- approached the boy's bed. However, the mongoose confronted this, his natural enemy, and fearing that it might kill his brother, the mongoose attacked the wicked snake, tore it to bits, and threw the pieces far and wide. Proud of his valor and his face covered with blood, the mongoose approached the mother to tell her what had happened. However, the mother, seeing his blood-spattered face and sensing his excitement, feared, ""without doubt this evildoer has devoured our son."" Driven by anger and without further investigation she threw the water-filled pitcher at the mongoose, killing the him instantly. Paying no further attention to the mongoose, she rushed into the house where she found the boy still asleep. Near the bed she saw a large black snake, torn to bits. Then her heart was overcome with sorrow because of the thoughtless murder of her praiseworthy son, the mongoose, and she beat herself on the head, the breast, and her other body parts. While this was happening the Brahman returned home with alms from wherever he had been begging. ""See there!"" she cried, overcome with grief for her son, the mongoose. ""Oh, you greedy one! Because you let greed rule you instead of doing what I told you to, you now must taste the fruit of your own tree of sin, the pain of your son's death."" On the banks of the Ganges, which also flows by the most holy city of Benares, there is a town named Mithila, where dwelt a very poor Brahman called Vidyadhara. He had no children, and to compensate for this want, he and his wife tenderly nourished in their house a mongoose -- a species of weasel. It was their all in all -- their younger son, their elder daughter -- their younger son, their elder daughter -- their elder son, their younger daughter, so fondly did they regard that little creature. The god Visvesvara and his spouse Visalakshi observed this and had pity for the unhappy pair; so by their divine power they blessed them with a son. This most welcome addition to their family did not alienate the affections of the Brahman and his wife from the mongoose; on the contrary, their attachment increased, for they believed that it was because of their having adopted the pet that a son had been born to them. So the child and the mongoose were brought up together, as twin brothers, in the same cradle. It happened one day when the Brahman had gone out to beg alms of the pious and charitable, that his wife went into the garden to cull some pot-herbs, leaving the child asleep in his cradle, and by his side the mongoose kept guard. An old serpent, which was living in the well in the garden, crept into the house and under the cradle, and was beginning to climb into it to bite the child when the mongoose fiercely attacked it and tore it into several pieces, thus saving the life of the Brahman's little son, and the venomous snake, that came to slay, itself lay dead beneath the cradle. Pleased at having performed such an exploit, the mongoose ran into the garden to show the Brahman's wife its blood-smeared mouth, but she rashly mistook the deliverer of her child for his destroyer, and with one stroke of the knife in her hand with which she was cutting herbs she killed the faithful creature, and then hastened into the house to see her dead son. But there she found the child in his cradle alive and well, only crying at the absence of his little companion, the mongoose, and under the cradle lay the great serpent cut to pieces. The real state of affairs was now evident, and the Brahman presently returning home, his wife told him of her rash act and then put an end to her life. The Brahman, in his turn, disconsolate at the death of the mongoose and his wife, first slew his child and then killed himself.","India, The Panchatantra India, Georgiana Kingscote","Source: The Panchatantra, book 5, story 2.

So Gellert lay down by the side of the cradle and stretched his great paws out, as if to say: ""No one shall come near my little master."" The afternoon went by, the hunt was over, and Llewellyn drew near his castle. He sounded his horn, and threw himself from his horse at the door. Gellert came bounding out, but to his horror Llewellyn saw that his mouth was dripping with blood, and there were marks of blood all about.

Everything was in confusion. The cradle was empty, and the clothes were thrown about. He stood still, ready to faint, when he heard a little sound. Perhaps his son still lived. He went to the cradle, and there on the floor behind it was his little boy, laughing, and pulling the hair of a great shaggy wolf that lay stretched out dead beside him. Then the whole story was clear to him. The wolf had come in through the open door, had stolen toward the cradle, when Gellert had sprung upon the wolf, had fought with him and slain him. O happy father! O unhappy prince! To have his child back again, and to have slain that child's faithful guardian!

Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert,0178a,"The Greyhound, the Serpent, and the Child","It happened one day that there was a running at tilt and tournament in the public place appointed for that purpose, to which this gentleman, amongst others, resorted. And no sooner was he gone, but his lady, with her maidens also, went to see it; the nurse also, to satisfy her curiosity, went privately, and left the child lying in the cradle in the hall, and the greyhound in the room. The gentleman's house being out of repair, in the very room where the child was issued out of a hole a great and horrible serpent, which approaching the cradle with all speed, to slay the child. The greyhound perceived it and flew at the serpent to preserve the child; and so furious was the engagement that the cradle was overturned with the child in it, the bottom upwards, but without any harm to the child, because the clothes fell underneath, and the cradle stood on the four pummels. The dog being enraged, as well at the wounds he received of the serpent, as the wrong designed his young master, fell with redoubled fury upon the serpent, and at last remained victorious, tearing the serpent in such a manner that he was all besmeared with his blood; and then he laid himself down in his place and licked his wounds. Not long after this, the tilting being ended, the nurse came into the chamber and saw the cradle turned upside down, compassed round about with blood, and the greyhound likewise all bloody; and without looking any further tore her clothes, and in a fright, with outrageous cries, carried the sad new to her lay, that the greyhound had slain the child. Hereupon the mother, full of despair and grief for the loss of her only son, likewise rent he clothes and broke out into dismal exclamations, and her maidens who had accompanied her, adding to the lamentation, made the whole house ring; and yet not any of them had the wit to go and turn the cradle up to see what had happened, continuing their outcries, till the gentleman returned from the tournament, to whom the lady, with tears and aggravations, related what she had imagined by the nurse's discourse. The knight, hearing these sad tidings, full of rage and grief, went into the hall; where meeting the poor greyhound, who came fawning upon him, as he used to do, and seeing him all bloody, he immediately concluded that all they had told him was true; and drawing out his sword he run him quite through the windpipe and neck, so that the poor dog fell down dead at the feet of his mistaken master. No sooner had the angry knight done this, but he went and took up the cradle, and there he found his son alive and well, and seeing then the slaughtered serpent, which nobody has minded before, he perceived the greyhound had killed the serpent in defense of the child.

The Bell of Atri,0207c,"Of the Vicissitude of Everything Good, and Especially of a Right Justice","It chanced that a serpent made her nest immediately under the bell-rope, and in due time brought forth young. When they were old enough, one day she conducted them forth to enjoy the fresh air beyond the city. Now, while the serpent was absent, a toad entered and occupied her nest. When, therefore, the former returned with her young, she found the toad in possession, and instantly began an attack. But the latter baffled her attempts, and obstinately maintained his station. The serpent, perceiving her inability to eject the intruder, coiled her tail around the bell-rope, and forcibly rang the bell; as though she had said, ""Descend, judge, and give me justice; for the toad has wrongfully seized my nest."" The judge, hearing the bell, descended; but not seeing anyone, returned. The serpent, finding her design abortive, once more sounded the alarm. The judge again appeared, and upon this occasion, seeing the serpent attached to the bell-rope, and the toad in possession of her nest, declared the whole circumstance to the emperor. ""Go down, my lord,"" said the latter, ""and not only drive away the toad, but kill him; let the serpent possess her right."" All which was done. On a subsequent day, as the king lay in his bed, the serpent entered the bedchamber carrying a precious stone in her mouth. The servants, perceiving this, informed the emperor, who gave directions that they should not harm it; ""for,"" added he, ""it will do me no injury."" The serpent, gliding along, ascended the bed, and approaching the emperor's eyes, let the stone fall upon them, and immediately left the room. No sooner, however, had the stone touched the eyes than their sight was completely restored. Infinitely rejoiced at what had happened, the emperor made inquiry after the serpent, but it was not heard of again.

The Bell of Atri,0207c,The Bell of Atri,"At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town Of ancient Roman date, but scant renown, One of those little places that have run Half up the hill, beneath a blazing sun, And then sat down to rest, as if to say, ""I climb no farther upward, come what may,"" -- The Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame, So many monarchs since have borne the name, Had a great bell hung in the market-place, Beneath a roof, projecting some small space By way of shelter from the sun and rain. Then rode he through the streets with all his train, And, with the blast of trumpets loud and long, Made proclamation, that whenever wrong Was done to any man, he should but ring The great bell in the square, and he, the King, Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon. Such was the proclamation of King John. How swift the happy days in Atri sped, What wrongs were righted, need not here be said. Suffice it that, as all things must decay, The hempen rope at length was worn away, Unraveled at the end, and, strand by strand, Loosened and wasted in the ringer's hand, Till one, who noted this in passing by, Mended the rope with braids of briony, So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine Hung like a votive garland at a shrine. By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt A knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt, Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods, Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods, Who loved his hounds and horses, and all sports And prodigalities of camps and courts; -- Loved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old, His only passion was the love of gold. He sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds, Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds Kept but one steed, his favorite steed of all, To starve and shiver in a naked stall, And day by day sat brooding in his chair, Devising plans how best to hoard and spare. At length he said: ""What is the use or need To keep at my own cost this lazy steed, Eating his head off in my stables here, When rents are low and provender is dear? Let him go feed upon the public ways; I want him only for the holidays."" So the old steed was turned into the heat; Of the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street; And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn, Barked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn. One afternoon, as in that sultry clime It is the custom in the summer time, With bolted doors and window-shutters closed, The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed; When suddenly upon their senses fell The loud alarm of the accusing bell! The Syndic started from his deep repose, Turned on his couch, and listened, and then rose And donned his robes, and with reluctant pace Went panting forth into the market-place, Where the great bell upon its cross-beams swung, Reiterating with persistent tongue, In half-articulate jargon, the old song: ""Some one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!"" But ere he reached the belfry's light arcade He saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade, No shape of human form of woman born, But a poor steed dejected and forlorn, Who with uplifted head and eager eye Was tugging at the vines of briony. ""Domeneddio!"" cried the Syndic straight, ""This is the Knight of Atri's steed of state! He calls for justice, being sore distressed, And pleads his cause as loudly as the best."" Meanwhile from street and land a noisy crowd Had rolled together like a summer cloud, And told the story of the wretched beast In five-and-twenty different ways at least, With much gesticulation and appeal To heathen gods, in their excessive zeal. The Knight was called and questioned; in reply Did not confess the fact, did not deny; Treated the matter as a pleasant jest, And set at naught the Syndic and the rest, Maintaining, in an angry undertone, That he should do what pleased him with his own. And thereupon the Syndic gravely read The proclamation of the King; then said: ""Pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay, But cometh back on foot, and begs its way; Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds, Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds! These are familiar proverbs; but I fear They never yet have reached your knightly ear. What fair renown, what honor, what repute Can come to you from starving this poor brute? He who serves well and speaks not, merits more Than they who clamor loudest at the door. Therefore the law decrees that as this steed Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed To comfort his old age, and to provide Shelter in stall, and food and field beside."" The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all Led home the steed in triumph to his stall. The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee, And cried aloud: ""Right well it pleaseth me! Church-bells at best but ring us to the door; But go not in to mass; my bell doth more: It cometh into court and pleads the cause Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws; And this shall make, in every Christian clime, The Bell of Atri famous for all time.""",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Source: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Tales of a Wayside Inn (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, [1915]), pp. 137-41.","""The Bell of Atri"" is ""The Sicilian's Tale"" from part two of Tales of a Wayside Inn.

The Bell of Atri,0207c,The Dumb Plaintiff,"In early days, when the ruins now crowning the hill were part of a strong fortress, the lord of Eckhardtsberg, wishing to render justice to all men, placed a bell in his tower. He fastened to it a long piece of rope which hung outside the gate, within easy reach of every hand, and bade all those who wished redress to ring it loudly, promising to grant them an immediate hearing. One day the bell pealed loudly, and when in answer to its call the lord of Eckhardtsberg, followed by all his retainers, came out to hear the complaint, he was surprised to find a poor old horse, which, urged by hunger, was trying to chew the end of the hempen rope. One of the bystanders immediately recognized the horse as belonging to a neighboring knight. For many a year the horse had been his favorite steed, had borne him safely through many a fight, but now that it was old and useless the cruel master had turned it out to seek pasture along the highway, where it found but scant subsistence. The lord of Eckhardtsberg, seeing the animal's sorry plight, and hearing how faithfully it had served its master in the days of its youth, declared that in return for its former services it should now be treated with respect, and condemned the unfeeling, avaricious owner to give it a place in his stable and plenty of food as long as it lived.

The Bell of Atri,0207c,The Emperor Charlemagne and the Serpent,"In the days of the early Christian persecution, Felix and Regula, the patron saints of Zürich, were beheaded near this town. Strange to relate, though, immediately after the execution, both martyrs picked up their severed heads, tucked them under their arms, and stalked off to the spot where the minster now stands, where they wound up their marvelous performances by burying themselves comfortably! On the spot where they suffered martyrdom Charlemagne erected a memorial pillar, above which he hung a bell, saying that it could be rung by anyone who had been wronged, and that they should receive immediate justice. During one of his visits to Zürich, Charlemagne took up his abode in the Choristers' House, and while he sat there at table one day he suddenly heard a loud peal from the bell of justice. He immediately dispatched a servant to see what wrong had been done, and was greatly annoyed when the man reported that careful search had failed to reveal the presence of any living creature. A few moments later the bell rang again, but when the servant once more announced that no one was there, the emperor bade his guards hide near the pillar, and seize the miscreant who dared to pull the bell of justice in mere fun. Before long the bell sounded a third time, and a few moments later the guards rushed into the emperor's presence with faces blanched with fear, to report that a snake had coiled itself around the pillar, and seizing the rope in its teeth, tugged until the bell rang forth loud and clear. The emperor immediately rose from table, saying he must see this phenomenon with his own eyes, and followed by all his court went down to the pillar. As he drew near, the snake came forward to meet him, and rising upon its coiled tail, bowed low before the monarch in evident recognition of his exalted station. Then, dropping down to the earth once more, it crept away, turning from time to time, and making signs as if to invite the emperor to follow. The serpent's actions were so eloquent that Charlemagne, understanding them, obediently followed it down to the edge of the water, where, parting the reeds, the snake showed him its nest, in which sat an enormous toad. Charlemagne now bade his guards seize and kill the intruder, and when the snake had bowed its thanks and contentedly coiled itself around its eggs, he went back to his interrupted meal, loudly praising the bell by means of which even dumb animals could appeal for justice. The next day, while the emperor again sat at dinner, the guards rushed in breathlessly to announce the coming of the strange snake. Charlemagne quickly bade them stand aside and not try to hinder the reptile, which now crawled into the room where he sat, climbed upon the table, did obeisance to the emperor, and delicately lifting the cover of his drinking cup, dropped into it a jewel of fabulous price. Then, replacing the cover of the vessel, the snake bowed low again, and creeping down, left the cloister to return to its nest by the lake. According to one version of this legend, Charlemagne set this precious stone in a ring which he gave to his wife, Frastrada. Unknown to him, however, the stone had the magic power of fixing his affections upon its wearer. When the queen, therefore, thought she was about to die, she slipped the ring into her mouth to prevent its falling into the hands of some rival. For eighteen years Charlemagne refused to part with his wife's body, and carried it with him wherever he went. But at the end of that time his minister Turpin discovered the secret of his infatuation, and obtaining possession of the magic stone, soon saw all Charlemagne's affections fixed upon him. As the emperor's devotion proved somewhat of a bore to the old minister, he tried to get rid of the spell by casting the ring into the mineral springs at Aix-la-Chapelle. While out hunting the next day, Charlemagne urged his steed to drink of that water, and when the animal hastily withdrew its foot and refused to approach the pool again, the emperor dismounted to investigate the cause. Touching the imprint of the horse's hoof, Charlemagne discovered that the mud was very warm, for he was near the hottest of these thermal springs. While resting near that pool, he was seized with such an affection for the spot that he soon founded there his capital of Aix-la-Chapelle. In memory of the horse which guided him hither, the Cathedral was built in the shape of a horseshoe, and as Charlemagne could not endure the thought of ever leaving this enchanted neighborhood, he left orders to bury him in the minster of Aix-la-Chapelle. On the spot where Charlemagne's famous bell once hung, at Zurich, stands the Wasserkirche, which now contains a large library with valuable and interesting manuscripts. Charlemagne's great-grandson Louis II. often visited Zürich, where his two pious daughters induced him to build a convent and the Frauenmünster. It is said that the place for these buildings was staked out by angel hands, and that the stakes were connected by a silken string of the finest make. This rope was hung above the altar of the new church, where it remained until the Reformation. It was then removed with many other relics, and served for years as ordinary bell-rope in a private house. The king's daughters, who both became abbesses, long dwelt at Baldern Castle, whence, however, they went down to the Frauenmünster whenever the bell rang for prayers. They even attended the midnight services there, and when it was very dark a stately stag invariably walked before them carrying a flaming torch between its antlers.",Switzerland,"Source: H. A.

Lying Tales,1965,Sir Gammer Vans,"Last Sunday morning at six o'clock in the evening as I was sailing over the tops of the mountains in my little boat, I met two men on horseback riding on one mare. So I asked them, could they tell me whether the little old woman was dead yet who was hanged last Saturday week for drowning herself in a shower of feathers? They said they could not positively inform me, but if I went to Sir Gammer Vans he could tell me all about it. ""But how am I to know the house?"" said I. ""Ho, 'tis easy enough,"" said they, ""for 'tis a brick house, built entirely of flints, standing alone by itself in the middle of sixty or seventy others just like it."" ""Oh, nothing in the world is easier,"" said I. ""Nothing can be easier,"" said they. So I went on my way. Now this Sir G. Vans was a giant, and a bottle maker. And as all giants who are bottle makers usually pop out of a little thumb-bottle from behind the door, so did Sir G. Vans. ""How d'ye do?"" says he. ""Very well, I thank you,"" says I. ""Have some breakfast with me?"" ""With all my heart,"" says I. So he gave me a slice of beer, and a cup of cold veal. And there was a little dog under the table that picked up all the crumbs. ""Hang him,"" says I. ""No, don't hang him,"" says he, ""for he killed a hare yesterday. And if you don't believe me, I'll show you the hare alive in a basket."" So he took me into his garden to show me the curiosities. In one corner there was a fox hatching eagle's eggs. In another there was an iron apple tree, entirely covered with pears and lead. In the third there was the hare which the dog killed yesterday alive in the basket. And in the fourth there were twenty-four hipper switches threshing tobacco, and at the sight of me they threshed so hard that they drove the plug through the wall, and through a little dog that was passing by on the other side. I, hearing the dog howl, jumped over the wall and turned it as neatly inside out as possible, when it ran away as if it had not an hour to live. Then he took me into the park to show me his deer. And I remembered that I had a warrant in my pocket to shoot venison for his majesty's dinner. So I set fire to my bow, poised my arrow, and shot amongst them. I broke seventeen ribs on one side, and twenty-one and a half on the other, but my arrow passed clean through without ever touching it, and the worst was I lost my arrow. However, I found it again in the hollow of a tree. I felt it. It felt clammy. I smelt it. It smelt honey. ""Oh, ho,"" said I. ""Here's a bee's nest,"" when out sprang a covey of partridges. I shot at them.

Lying Tales,1965,The Three Brothers,"Once upon a time there were three brothers. Two had no clothes and one no shirt. The weather was very bad, and they make up their minds to go shooting. So they took down three guns -- two were broken and one had no barrel -- and walked and walked until they came at last to a meadow, where they saw a hare. They began to fire at it, but could not catch it. ""What shall we do?"" said one of them. They remembered that nearby a godmother of theirs lived. So they went and knocked at her door and asked her to lend them a pot to cook the hare they had not caught. The godmother was not at home, but nevertheless she answered, ""My children, go in the kitchen and there you will find three pots, two broken and one with no bottom. Take whichever you wish."" ""Thanks, godmother!"" They went into the kitchen and chose the one without a bottom and put the hare in it to cook. While the hare was cooking, one said, ""Let ask our godmother whether she has anything in her garden."" So they asked her, and she said, ""I have three walnut trees. Two are dead and one has never borne any nuts. Knock off as many as you wish."" One went and shook the tree that had never borne nuts, and a little nut fell on his hat and broke his heel. Thereupon they picked up the nuts and went to get the hare, which meanwhile was cooked, and said, ""What shall we do with so much stuff?"" So they went to a village where there were many ill, and they put up a notice in the street that whoever wished might, at such and such a place, get broth given him in charity. Everyone went to get some, and they took it in the salad basket, and it was given to them with a skimmer. One who did not belong to the village drank so much of this broth that he was at the point of death. Then they went for three physicians. One was blind, one deaf, and one dumb. The blind man went in and said, ""Let me look at your tongue."" The deaf man said, ""How are you?"" The dumb said, ""Give me some paper, pen, and ink.""

Man and Serpent,0285d,Of Good Advice,"In the reign of the Emperor Fulgentius, a certain knight, named Zedechias, married a very beautiful but imprudent wife. In a certain chamber of their mansion a serpent dwelt. Now, the knight's vehement inclination for tournaments and jousting brought him to extreme poverty. He grieved immoderately, and, like one who was desperate, walked backward and forward, ignorant of what he should do. The serpent, beholding his misery, like the ass of Balaam, was on that occasion miraculously gifted with a voice, and said to the knight, ""Why do you lament? Take my advice, and you shall not repent it. Supply me every day with a certain quantity of sweet milk, and I will enrich you."" This promise exhilarated the knight, and he faithfully followed the instructions of his subtle friend. The consequence was that he had a beautiful son, and became exceedingly wealthy. But it happened that his wife one day said to him, ""My lord, I am sure that serpent has great riches hidden in the chamber where he dwells. Let us kill him and get possession of the whole."" The advice pleased the knight, and at the request of his wife he took a hammer to destroy the serpent, and a vessel of milk. Allured by the milk, it put its head out of the hole, as it had been accustomed; and the knight lifted the hammer to strike it. The serpent, observing his perfidy, suddenly drew back its head; and the blow fell upon the vessel. No sooner had he done this, than his offspring died, and he lost everything that he formerly possessed. The wife, taught by their common loss, said to him, ""Alas! I have ill counseled you; but go now to the hole of the serpent, and humbly acknowledge your offense. Peradventure you may find grace."" The knight complied, and standing before the dwelling place of the serpent, shed many tears, and entreated that he might once more be made rich. ""I see,"" answered the serpent, ""I see now that you are a fool, and will always be a fool. For how can I forget that blow of the hammer which you designed me, for which reason I slew your son and took away your wealth? There can be no real peace between us."" The knight, full of sorrow, replied thus, ""I promise the most unshaken fidelity, and will never meditate the slightest injury, provided I may this once obtain your grace."" ""My friend,"" said the serpent, ""it is the nature of my species to be subtle and venomous. Let what I have said suffice. The blow offered at my head is fresh upon my recollection; get you gone before you receive an injury."" The knight departed in great affliction, saying to his wife, ""Fool that I was to take your counsel!"" But ever afterwards they lived in the greatest indigence.

Man and Serpent,0285d,The Gold-Giving Snake,"In a certain place there lived a Brahman by the name of Haridatta. He tilled the soil, but his time in the field brought him no harvest. Then one day, as the hottest hours were just over, tormented by the heat, he lay down in the shade of a tree in the middle of his field for a sleep. He saw a frightful snake, decorated with a large hood, crawl from an anthill a little way off, and thought to himself, ""This is surely the goddess of the field, and I have not once paid her homage. That is why the field remains barren. I must bring her an offering."" After thus thinking it over, he got some milk, poured it into a basin, then went to the anthill, and said, ""Oh, protector of this field, for a long time I did not know that you live here. For this reason I have not yet brought you an offering. Please forgive me!"" Having said this, he set forth the milk, and went home. The next day he returned to see what had happened, and he found a dinar in the basin. And thus it continued day by day. He brought the snake milk, and always found a dinar there the next morning. One day the Brahman asked his son to take the milk to the anthill, and he himself went into the village. The son brought the milk, set it there, and returned home. When he came back the next day and found a dinar, he said to himself, ""This anthill must be full of gold dinars. I will kill the snake and take them all at once!"" Having decided this, the Brahman's son returned the next day with the milk and a club. As he gave the milk to the snake, he struck her on the head with the club. The snake, as fate willed it, escaped with her life. Filled with rage, she bit the boy with her sharp, poisoned teeth, and the boy fell dead at once. His people built a funeral pyre not far from the field and cremated him. Two days later his father returned. When he discovered under what circumstances his son had died, he said that justice had prevailed. The next morning, he once again took milk, went to the anthill, and praised the snake with a loud voice. A good while later the snake appeared in the entrance to the anthill, and said, ""You come here from greed, letting even your grief for your son pass by. From now on friendship between you and me will no longer be possible. Your son, in his youthful lack of understanding, struck me. I bit him. How can I forget the club's blow? How can you forget the pain and sorrow for your son?"" After saying this she gave him a costly pearl for a pearl chain, said, ""Do not come back,"" and disappeared into her cave. The Brahman took the pearl, cursed his son's lack of understanding, and returned home.

Man and Serpent,0285d,The Man and the Serpent,"A countryman's son by accident trod upon a serpent's tail, which turned and bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his ax, and pursuing the serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the serpent in revenge began stinging several of the farmer's cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the farmer thought it best to make it up with the serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it, ""Let's forget and forgive. Perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him. Now that we are both satisfied, why should not we be friends again?""

He must go inside, where he would find his wife awaiting him, and ask her to get him a drink of fresh water from the spring. That was all. He went home and knew that the Black Rattlesnake was following. It was night when he arrived and very dark, but he found his wife waiting with his supper ready. He sat down and asked for a drink of water. She handed him a gourd full from the jar, but he said he wanted it fresh from the spring, so she took a bowl and went out of the door. The next moment he heard a cry, and going out he found that the Black Rattlesnake had bitten her and that she was already dying. He stayed with her until she was dead, when the Black Rattlesnake came out from the grass again and said his tribe was now satisfied. He then taught the hunter a prayer song, and said, ""When you meet any of us hereafter sing this song and we will not hurt you; but if by accident one of us should bite one of your people then sing this song over him and he will recover.""

""Have you ever seen anything like that? That must be an unnatural father who makes his poor boy run on foot while he himself rides proudly along on the donkey!"" The Hodja momentarily halted the donkey. ""Climb up here with me!"" he said to his son. A short distance later they came upon another party, who likewise expressed their opinion clearly. ""Such animal abuse! Isn't that shameless, for a cleric to torment such a poor donkey! Couldn't the two of you use your own legs and give the donkey a little rest?"" The Hodja stopped once again.

The Mermaid Wife,4080,Herman Perk and the Seal,"The islanders were often in the habit of visiting the outlying Vee Skerries for the purpose of hunting seals. On one occasion a man named Herman Perk, accompanied by others, left for the skerries in a small boat. When they arrived there Herman was landed on the rocks, but his companions remained in the boat to prevent it getting damaged. It happened, however, that a severe storm burst without warning, and the men found after several daring attempts, that it was quite impossible to get Herman off again. The storm was increasing in severity, and latterly they were compelled, for their own safety, to attempt getting back to Papa. After a terrible passage they succeeded in reaching the island, and their first act was to proceed to the home of their ill-fated companion to tell his folk what had befallen him. Imagine their surprise, however, on finding him comfortably seated at his fireside. Herman had a strange story to tell them. Shortly after the boat left the skerries, he observed a large seal coming up, and as he watched its progress, it suddenly raised itself in the angry sea, and he became aware that it was speaking to him. ""Herman Perk,"" it said, ""you have destroyed many of our folks in your time, yet nevertheless if you will undertake to do me a service, I will carry you in safety to Papa tonight. Some time ago my wife Maryara was made captive in Papa. Her skin is now hanging in the skio (hut for drying fish) at Nortoos, and without it she cannot return with me to Finmark [in northern Norway]. It is the third skin from the door, and I wish you to bring it to me."" Herman had readily agreed to this proposition, whereupon he was told to cut two slits in the seal's back as supports for his feet, and then place his arms firmly round the animal's neck. The latter immediately took to the water, and in a remarkably short time Herman had the gratification of landing safely in Papa. True to his promise, he went to the skio indicated, where he found the skin without any difficulty, and carried it down to the beach. The seal was waiting his coming, and at its side was the most beautiful woman he had ever beheld. The seal gave the skin to its lovely companion, and then apparently left its own body behind, and the happy pair immediately took their departure over the sea. The following morning Herman went again to Nortoos. There, sure enough, lay the skin of a large seal, and it had two cuts behind the flippers. He placed it where he had taken the other from. After that Herman was a prosperous man, but he was never known to visit the Vee Skerries again.",Shetland Islands,"Source: John Nicolson, Some Folk-Tales and Legends of Shetland, (Edinburgh: Thomas Allan and Sons, 1920), pp. 62-63.",NA,NA
The Mermaid Wife,4080,The Lady of Gollerus,"""'Tis just the pattern of a pretty morning,"" said Dick, taking the pipe from between his lips, and looking towards the distant ocean, which lay as still and tranquil as a tomb of polished marble. ""Well, to be sure,"" continued he, after a pause, ""'tis mighty lonesome to be talking to one's self by way of company, and not to have another soul to answer one -- nothing but the child of one's own voice, the echo! I know this, that if I had the luck, or maybe the misfortune,"" said Dick, with a melancholy smile, ""to have the woman, it would not be this way with me! And what in the wide world is a man without a wife? He's no more, surely, than a bottle without a drop of drink in it, or dancing without music, or the left leg of a scissors, or a fishing line without a hook, or any other matter that is no ways complete. Is it not so?"" said Dick Fitzgerald, casting his eyes towards a rock upon the strand, which, though it could not speak, stood up as firm and looked as bold as ever Kerry witness did. But what was his astonishment at beholding, just at the foot of that rock, a beautiful young creature combing her hair, which was of a sea-green color; and now the salt water shining on it, appeared, in the morning light, like melted butter upon cabbage. Dick guessed at once that she was a merrow, although he had never seen one before, for he spied the cohuleen druith, or little enchanted cap, which the sea people use for diving down into the ocean, lying upon the strand near her; and he had heard that if once he could possess himself of the cap, she would lose the power of going away into the water; so he seized it with all speed, and she, hearing the noise, turned her head about as natural as any Christian. When the merrow saw that her little diving cap was gone, the salt tears -- doubly salt, no doubt, from her -- came trickling down her cheeks, and she began a low mournful cry with just the tender voice of a newborn infant. Dick, although he knew well enough what she was crying for, determined to keep the cohuleen druith, let her cry never so much, to see what luck would come out of it. Yet he could not help pitying her; and when the dumb thing looked up in his face, and her cheeks all moist with tears, 'twas enough to make anyone feel, let alone Dick, who had ever and always, like most of his countrymen, a mighty tender heart of his own. ""Don't cry, my darling,"" said Dick Fitzgerald; but the merrow, like any bold child, only cried the more for that. Dick sat himself down by her side, and took hold of her hand, by way of comforting her. 'Twas in no particular an ugly hand, only there was a small web between the fingers, as there is in a duck's foot; but 'twas as thin and as white as the skin between egg and shell. ""What's your name, my darling?"" says Dick, thinking to make her conversant with him; but he got no answer; and he was certain sure now, either that she could not speak, or did not understand him. He therefore squeezed her hand in his, as the only way he had of talking to her. It's the universal language; and there's not a woman in the world, be she fish or lady, that does not understand it. The merrow did not seem much displeased at this mode of conversation; and, making an end of her whining all at once, ""Man,"" says she, looking up in Dick Fitzgerald's face, ""Man, will you eat me?"" ""By all the red petticoats and check aprons between Dingle and Tralee,"" cried Dick, jumping up in amazement, ""I'd as soon eat myself, my jewel! Is it I eat you, my pet? Now, 'twas some ugly ill-looking thief of a fish put that notion into your own pretty head, with the nice green hair down upon it, that is so cleanly combed out this morning!"" ""Man,"" said the merrow, ""what will you do with me, if you won't eat me?"" Dick's thoughts were running on a wife. He saw, at the first glimpse, that she was handsome; but since she spoke, and spoke too like any real woman, he was fairly in love with her. 'Twas the neat way she called him ""man"" that settled the matter entirely. ""Fish,"" says Dick, trying to speak to her after her own short fashion. ""Fish,"" says he, ""here's my word, fresh and fasting, for you this blessed morning, that I'll make you Mistress Fitzgerald before all the world, and that's what I'll do."" ""Never say the word twice."" says she. ""I'm ready and willing to be yours, Mister Fitzgerald; but stop, if you please, 'till I twist up my hair."" It was some time before she had settled it entirely to her liking, for she guessed, I suppose, that she was going among strangers, where she would be looked at. When that was done, the merrow put the comb in her pocket, and then bent down her head and whispered some words to the water that was close to the foot of the rock. Dick saw the murmur of the words upon the top of the sea, going out towards the wide ocean, just like a breath of wind rippling along, and, says he, in the greatest wonder, ""Is it speaking you are, my darling, to the saltwater?"" ""It's nothing else,"" says she, quite carelessly, ""I'm just sending word home to my father, not to be waiting breakfast for me, just to keep him from being uneasy in his mind."" ""And who's your father, my duck?"" says Dick. ""What!"" said the merrow, ""Did you never hear of my father? He's the king of the waves, to be sure!"" ""And yourself, then, is a real king's daughter?"" said Dick, opening his two eyes to take a full and true survey of his wife that was to be. ""Oh, I'm nothing else but a made man with you, and a king your father. To be sure he has all the money that's down in the bottom of the sea!"" ""Money,"" repeated the merrow, ""what's money?"" ""'Tis no bad thing to have when one wants it,"" replied Dick; ""and maybe now the fishes have the understanding to bring up whatever you bid them?"" ""Oh! yes,"" said the merrow, ""they bring me what I want."" ""To speak the truth,"" said Dick, ""'tis a straw bed I have at home before you, and that, I'm thinking, is no ways fitting for a king's daughter; so if 'twould not be displeasing to you, just to mention, a nice featherbed, with a pair of new blankets -- but what am I talking about? Maybe you have not such things as beds down under the water?"" ""By all means,"" said she, ""Mr. Fitzgerald -- plenty of beds at your service. I've fourteen oyster beds of my own, not to mention one just planting for the rearing of young ones."" ""You have,"" says Dick, scratching his head and looking a little puzzled. ""'Tis a featherbed I was speaking of, but clearly, yours is the very cut of a decent plan, to have bed and supper so handy to each other, that a person, when they'd have the one, need never ask for the other."" However, bed or no bed, money or no money, Dick Fitzgerald determined to marry the merrow, and the merrow had given her consent. Away they went, therefore, across the strand, from Gollerus to Ballinrunnig, where Father Fitzgibbon happened to be that morning. ""There are two words to this bargain, Dick Fitzgerald,"" said his Reverence, looking mighty glum. ""And is it a fishy woman you'd marry? The Lord preserve us! Send the scaly creature home to her own people, that's my advice to you, wherever she came from."" Dick had the cohuleen druith in his hand, and was about to give it back to the merrow, who looked covetously at it, but he thought for a moment, and then, says he, ""Please your Reverence, she's a king's daughter."" ""If she was the daughter of fifty kings,"" said Father Fitzgibbon, ""I tell you, you can't marry her, she being a fish."" ""Please your Reverence,"" said Dick again, in an undertone, ""she is as mild and as beautiful as the moon."" ""If she was as mild and as beautiful as the sun, moon, and stars, all put together, I tell you, Dick Fitzgerald,"" said the priest, stamping his right foot, ""you can't marry her, she being a fish!"" ""But she has all the gold that's down in the sea only for the asking, and I'm a made man if I marry her; and,"" said Dick, looking up slyly, ""I can make it worth any one's while to do the job."" ""Oh! That alters the case entirely,"" replied the priest. ""Why there's some reason now in what you say. Why didn't you tell me this before? Marry her by all means, if she was ten times a fish. Money, you know, is not to be refused in these bad times, and I may as well have the hansel of it as another, that maybe would not take half the pains in counseling you as I have done."" So Father Fitzgibbon married Dick Fitzgerald to the merrow, and like any loving couple, they returned to Gollerus well pleased with each other. Everything prospered with Dick. He was at the sunny side of the world; the merrow made the best of wives, and they lived together in the greatest contentment. It was wonderful to see, considering where she had been brought up, how she would busy herself about the house, and how well she nursed the children; for, at the end of three years, there were as many young Fitzgeralds -- two boys and a girl. In short, Dick was a happy man, and so he might have continued to the end of his days, if he had only the sense to take proper care of what he had got. Many another man, however, beside Dick, has not had wit enough to do that. One day when Dick was obliged to go to Tralee, he left the wife minding the children at home after him, and thinking she had plenty to do without disturbing his fishing tackle. Dick was no sooner gone than Mrs. Fitzgerald set about cleaning up the house, and chancing to pull down a fishing net, what should she find behind it in a hole in the wall but her own cohuleen druith. She took it out and looked at it, and then she thought of her father the king, and her mother the queen, and her brothers and sisters, and she felt a longing to go back to them. She sat down on a little stool and thought over the happy days she had spent under the sea; then she looked at her children, and thought on the love and affection of poor Dick, and how it would break his heart to lose her. ""But,"" says she, ""he won't lose me entirely, for I'll come back to him again, and who can blame me for going to see my father and my mother after being so long away from them?"" She got up and went towards the door, but came back again to look once more at the child that was sleeping in the cradle. She kissed it gently, and as she kissed it a tear trembled for an instant in her eye and then fell on its rosy cheek. She wiped away the tear, and turning to the eldest little girl, told her to take good care of her brothers, and to be a good child herself until she came back. The merrow then went down to the strand. The sea was lying calm and smooth, just heaving and glittering in the sun, and she thought she heard a faint sweet singing, inviting her to come down. All her old ideas and feelings came flooding over her mind. Dick and her children were at the instant forgotten, and placing the cohuleen druith on her head, she plunged in. Dick came home in the evening, and missing his wife, he asked Kathelin, his little girl, what had become of her mother, but she could not tell him. He then enquired of the neighbors, and he learned that she was seen going towards the strand with a strange looking thing like a cocked hat in her hand. He returned to his cabin to search for the cohuleen druith. It was gone, and the truth now flashed upon him. Year after year did Dick Fitzgerald wait, expecting the return of his wife, but he never saw her more. Dick never married again, always thinking that the merrow would sooner or later return to him, and nothing could ever persuade him but that her father the king kept her below by main force; ""for,"" said Dick, ""she surely would not of herself give up her husband and her children."" While she was with him, she was so good a wife in every respect, that to this day she is spoken of in the tradition of the country as the pattern for one, under the name of the Lady of Gollerus.",Ireland,"Source: Thomas Crofton Croker, Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland, vol. 2 (London: John Murray, 1828), pp. 3-13.","Smerwick Harbor is at the tip of Dingle Peninsula in southwest Ireland.

The Mermaid Wife,4080,The Mermaid Wife,"On returning to the shore he met the fairest damsel that was ever gazed upon by mortal eyes, lamenting the robbery, by which she had become an exile from her submarine friends, and a tenant of the upper world. Vainly she implored the restitution of her property. The man had drunk deeply of love, and was inexorable; but he offered her protection beneath his roof as his betrothed spouse. The merlady, perceiving that she must become an inhabitant of the earth, found that she could not do better than accept of the offer. This strange attachment subsisted for many years, and the couple had several children. The Shetlander's love for his merwife was unbounded, but his affection was coldly returned. The lady would often steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal being given, a large seal would make his appearance, with whom she would hold, in an unknown tongue, an anxious conference. Years had thus glided away, when it happened that one of the children, in the course of his play, found concealed beneath a stack of corn a seal's skin; and, delighted with the prize, he ran with it to his mother. Her eyes glistened with rapture -- she gazed upon it as her own -- as the means by which she could pass through the ocean that led to her native home. She burst forth into an ecstasy of joy, which was only moderated when she beheld her children, whom she was now about to leave; and, after hastily embracing them, she fled with all speed towards the seaside. The husband immediately returned, learned the discovery that had taken place, ran to overtake his wife, but only arrived in time to see her transformation of shape completed -- to see her, in the form of a seal, bound from the ledge of a rock into the sea. The large animal of the same kind with whom she had held a secret converse soon appeared, and evidently congratulated her, in the most tender manner, on her escape. But before she dived to unknown depths, she cast a parting glance at the wretched Shetlander, whose despairing looks excited in her breast a few transient feelings of commiseration. ""Farewell!"" said she to him ""and may all good attend you. I loved you very well when I resided upon earth, but I always loved my first husband much better.""",Shetland Islands,"Source: [C. J.

The Mermaid Wife,4080,The Sealskin,"Early one morning before people had gotten up, a man from Myrdal in the east was walking past some cliffs when he came to the entrance to a cave. He could hear that there was merrymaking and dancing going on inside the hill, and outside he saw a large number of sealskins. He picked up one of them, took it home, and locked it in his trunk. Some time later, in the course of the day, he went back to the cave's entrance. A beautiful young girl was sitting there. She was entirely naked and crying bitterly. She was the seal to whom the skin belonged that the man had taken. The man gave the girl some clothing, comforted her, and took her home with him. Later she came to accept him, but never got along very well with other people. She would often just sit there and look out to sea. After some time the man took her as his wife. They lived well together and had many children. The peasant hid the skin, locking it securely in his trunk, and he carried the key with him everywhere he went. Many years later he rowed out fishing and forgot the key at home under his pillow. However, others say that the peasant went to a Christmas service with his people, but that his wife had been sick and was unable to go with them. They say that he forgot to take the key out of the pocket of his everyday clothes when he changed. When he arrived home that evening the trunk was open, and his wife had disappeared with the skin. She had found the key, out of curiosity looked through the trunk, and found the skin. She could not resist the temptation. She said farewell to her children, put on the skin, and threw herself into the sea. Before the woman jumped into the sea, it is reported that she said: This I want, and yet I want it not, -- Seven children have I at the bottom of the sea, Seven children have I as well here above. It is said that this touched the peasant's heart. After this, when he rowed out fishing, a seal often swam around his boat, and it seemed that tears were running from its eyes. From this time on he was always successful catching fish, and luck often came to his beach. People frequently saw this couple's children walking on the beach while a seal swam along out in the sea accompanying them. It would throw colorful fish and pretty shells to them. But the mother never again returned to land.",Iceland,"Source: ""Das Seehundsfell,"" Isländische Märchen und Volkssagen (Berlin: Axel Juncker Verlag, 1919), pp. 258-59.",NA,Translated from Icelandic into German by Åge Avenstrup and Elisabeth Treitel.

The Mermaid Wife,4080,The Silkie Wife,"Those in the Shetland and Orkney Islands who know no better, are persuaded that the seals, or silkies, as they call them, can doff their coverings at times, and disport themselves as men and women. A fisher once turning a ridge of rock, discovered a beautiful bit of green turf adjoining the shingle, sheltered by rocks on the landward side, and over this turf and shingle two beautiful women chasing each other. Just at the man's feet lay two sealskins, one of which he took up to examine it. The women, catching sight of him, screamed out, and ran to get possession of the skins. One seized the article on the ground, donned it in a thrice, and plunged into the sea; the other wrung her hands, cried, and begged the fisher to restore her property; but he wanted a wife, and would not throw away the chance. He wooed her so earnestly and lovingly, that she put on some woman's clothing which he brought her from his cottage, followed him home, and became his wife. Some years later, when their home was enlivened by the presence of two children, the husband, awakening one night, heard voices in conversation from the kitchen. Stealing softly to the room door, he heard his wife talking in a low tone with someone outside the window. The interview was just at an end, and he had only time to ensconce himself in bed, when his wife was stealing across the room. He was greatly disturbed, but determined to do or say nothing till he should acquire further knowledge. Next evening, as he was returning home by the strand, he spied a male and female phoca sprawling on a rock a few yards out at sea. The rougher animal, raising himself on his tail and fins, thus addressed the astonished man in the dialect spoken in these islands, ""You deprived me of her whom I was to make my companion; and it was only yesternight that I discovered her outer garment, the loss of which obliged her to be your wife. I bear no malice, as you were kind to her in your own fashion; besides, my heart is too full of joy to hold any malice. Look on your wife for the last time."" The other seal glanced at him with all the shyness and sorrow she could force into her now uncouth features; but when the bereaved husband rushed toward the rock to secure his lost treasure, she and her companion were in the water on the other side of it in a moment, and the poor fisherman was obliged to return sadly to his motherless children and desolate home.",Shetland and Orkney Islands,"Source: Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts, collected and narrated by Patrick Kennedy (London: Macmillan and Company, 1866), pp. 122-24.",NA,NA
The Mermaid Wife,4080,Tom Moore and the Seal Woman,"There is a tale in Scotland concerning people of the clan MacCodrum, who were seals in the daytime, but men and women at night. No man of the MacCodrums, it is said, would kill a seal. The MacCodrums are mentioned in Gaelic as ""Clann Mhic Codruim nan rón"" (Clan MacCodrum of the seals). Tom's father and mother died, and he was alone in the house and in need of a wife. One morning early, when he was at work near the strand, he saw the finest woman ever seen in that part of the kingdom, sitting on a rock, fast asleep. The tide was gone from the rocks then, and Tom was curious to know who was she or what brought her, so he walked toward the rock. ""Wake up!"" cried Tom to the woman. ""If the tide comes 'twill drown you."" She raised her head and only laughed. Tom left her there, but as he was going he turned every minute to look at the woman. When he came back be caught the spade, but couldn't work; he had to look at the beautiful woman on the rock. At last the tide swept over the rock. He threw the spade down and away to the strand with him, but she slipped into the sea and he saw no more of her that time. Tom spent the day cursing himself for not taking the woman from the rock when it was God that sent her to him. He couldn't work out the day. He went home. Tom could not sleep a wink all that night. He was up early next morning and went to the rock. The woman was there. He called to her. No answer. He went up to the rock. ""You may as well come home with me now,"" said Tom. Not a word from the woman. Tom took the hood from her head and said, ""I'll have this!"" The moment be did that she cried, ""Give back my hood, Tom Moore!"" ""Indeed I will not, for 'twas God sent you to me, and now that you have speech I'm well satisfied!"" And taking her by the arm he led her to the house. The woman cooked breakfast, and they sat down together to eat it. ""Now,"" said Tom, ""in the name of God you and I'll go to the priest and get married, for the neighbors around here are very watchful; they'd be talking."" So after breakfast they went to the priest, and Tom asked him to marry them. ""Where did you get the wife?"" asked the priest. Tom told the whole story. When the priest saw Tom was so anxious to marry be charged £5, and Tom paid the money. He took the wife home with him, and she was as good a woman as ever went into a man's house. She lived with Tom seven years, and had three sons and two daughters. One day Tom was plowing, and some part of the plow rigging broke. He thought there were bolts on the loft at home, so he climbed up to get them. He threw down bags and ropes while he was looking for the bolts, and what should he throw down but the hood which he took from the wife seven years before. She saw it the moment it fell, picked it up, and hid it. At that time people heard a great seal roaring out in the sea. ""Ah,"" said Tom's wife, ""that's my brother looking for me."" Some men who were hunting killed three seals that day. All the women of the village ran down to the strand to look at the seals, and Tom's wife with the others. She began to moan, and going up to the dead seals she spoke some words to each and then cried out, ""Oh, the murder!"" When they saw her crying the men said, ""We'll have nothing more to do with these seals."" So they dug a great hole, and the three seals were put into it and covered. But some thought in the night, ""'Tis a great shame to bury those seals, after all the trouble in taking them."" Those men went with shovels and dug up the earth, but found no trace of the seals. All this time the big seal in the sea was roaring. Next day when Tom was at work his wife swept the house, put everything in order, washed the children and combed their hair; then, taking them one by one, she kissed each. She went next to the rock, and, putting the hood on her head, gave a plunge. That moment the big seal rose and roared so that people ten miles away could hear him. Tom's wife went away with the seal swimming in the sea. All the five children that she left had webs between their fingers and toes, halfway to the tips. The descendants of Tom Moore and the seal woman are living near Castlegregory to this day, and the webs are not gone yet from between their fingers and toes, though decreasing with each generation.",Ireland,"Source: Jeremiah Curtin, Tales of Fairies and of the Ghost World Collected from Oral Tradition in South-West Munster (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1895), pp. 150-54.",NA,NA
The Mermaid Wife,4080,Touched by Iron,"They there and then began to ""keep company,"" and met each other daily here and there along the farm meadows. His intentions were honorable; he desired her to marry him. He was sometimes absent for days together, no one knew where, and his friends whispered about that he had been witched. Around the Turf Lake (Llyn y Dywarchen) was a grove of trees, and under one of these one day the fairy promised to be his. The consent of her father was now necessary. One moonlight night an appointment was made to meet in this wood. The father and daughter did not appear till the moon had disappeared behind the hill. Then they both came. The fairy father immediately gave his consent to the marriage, on one condition, namely, that her future husband should never hit her with iron. ""If ever thou dost touch her flesh with iron she shall be no more thine, but she shall return to her own."" They were married -- a good-looking pair. Large sums of money were brought by her, the night before the wedding, to Drws Coed. The shepherd lad became wealthy, had several handsome children, and they were very happy. After some years, they were one day out riding, when her horse sank in a deep mire, and by the assistance of her husband, in her hurry to remount, she was struck on her knee by the stirrup of the saddle. Immediately voices were heard singing on the brow of the hill, and she disappeared, leaving all her children behind. She and her mother devised a plan by which she could see her beloved, but as she was not allowed to walk the earth with man, they floated a large turf on the lake, and on this turf she stood for hours at a time holding converse with her husband.

Midas,0782,March's Ears (1),"One of Arthur's warriors, whose name was March (or Parch) Amheirchion, was lord of Castellmarch in Lleyn. This man had horse's ears (resembling Midas), and lest anybody should know it, he used to kill every man he sought to shave his beard, for fear lest he should not be able to keep the secret; and on the spot where he was wont to bury the bodies there grew reeds, one of which somebody cut to make a pipe. The pipe would give no other sound than ""March Amheirchion has horse's ears."" When the warrior heard this, he would probably have killed the innocent man on that account, if he had not himself failed to make the pipe produce any other sound. But after hearing where the reed had grown, he made no further effort to conceal either the murders or his ears.

Midas,0782,March's Ears (2),"March ab Meirchion was lord of Castellmarch, in Lleyn. He ruled over leagues of rich land, tilled by hundreds of willing and obedient vassals. He had great possessions, fleet horses, greyhounds, hawks, countless black cattle and sheep, and a great herd of swine. (But few possessed pigs at that time, and their flesh was esteemed better than the flesh of oxen. Arthur himself sought to have one of March's sows.) In his palace he had much treasure of gold, silver, and Conway pearls, and all men envied him. But March was not happy. He had a secret, and day and night he was torn with dread lest it should be discovered. He had horse's ears! To no one was the secret known except his barber. This man he compelled to take a solemn oath that he would not reveal his deformity to any living soul. If he wittingly or unwittingly should let anyone know that March's ears were other than human, March swore that he would cut his head off. The barber became as unhappy as March. Indeed his wretchedness was greater, because his fate would be worse if the secret were revealed. March would undergo ridicule, which is certainly a serious thing, but the barber would undergo decapitation, which is much more serious. The secret disagreed with his constitution so violently that he lost his appetite and his color, and began to fall into a decline. So ill did he become that he had to call in a physician. This man was skilled in his craft, and he said to the barber, ""You are being killed by a suppressed secret. Unless you communicate it to someone you will soon be in your grave."" This announcement did not give the barber much consolation. He explained to the physician that if he did as he was directed he would lose his head. If in any event he had to come to the end of his earthly career, he preferred being interred with his head joined to, rather than separated from, his trunk. The physician then suggested that he should tell his secret to the ground. The barber thought there was not much danger to his cervical vertebrae (this is the learned name for neck bones) if he did this, and adopted the suggestion. He was at once relieved. His color and appetite gradually came back, and before long he was as strong and well as he had ever been. Now it happened that a fine crop of reeds grew on the spot where the barber whispered his secret to the ground. March prepared a great feast, and sent for one of Maelgwn Gwynedd's pipers, who was the best piper in the word, to make music for his guests. On his way to Castellmarch, the piper observed these fine reeds, and as his old pipe was getting worn out, he cut them and made an excellent new pipe. When his guests had eaten and drunk, March ordered the piper to play. What was the surprise of all when the pipe gave out no music, but only the words, ""Horse's ears for March ab Meirchion, horse's ears for March ab Meirchion,"" over and over again. March drew his sword and would have slain the piper, but the hapless musician begged for mercy. He was not to blame, he said. He had tried to play his wonted music, but the pipe was charmed, and do what he would, he could get nothing out of it but the words, ""Horse's ears for March ab Meirchion."" March tried the pipe himself, but even he could not elicit any strains from it, but only the words, ""Horse's ears for March ab Meirchion."" So he forgave the piper and made no further effort to conceal his deformity.",Wales,"Source: W. Jenkyn Thomas, The Welsh Fairy Book (London: T. Fisher Unwin, Ltd., [1908], pp. 93-95.",NA,NA
Midas,0782,Midas,"Bacchus, on a certain occasion, found his old schoolmaster and foster-father, Silenus, missing. The old man had been drinking, and in that state wandered away, and was found by some peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas. Midas recognized him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with an unceasing round of jollity. On the eleventh day he brought Silenus back, and restored him in safety to his pupil. Whereupon Bacchus offered Midas his choice of a reward, whatever he might wish. He asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold. Bacchus consented, though sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas went his way, rejoicing in his new-acquired power, which he hastened to put to the test. He could scarce believe his eyes when he found a twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, become gold in his hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched a sod; it did the same. He took up an apple from the tree; you would have thought he had robbed the garden of the Hesperides. His joy knew no bounds, and as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a splendid repast on the table. Then he found to his dismay that whether he touched bread, it hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lip, it defied his teeth. He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his throat like melted gold. In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately coveted. But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him. He raised his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from his glittering destruction. Bacchus, merciful deity, heard and consented. ""Go,"" said he, ""to River Pactolus, trace its fountain-head, there plunge yourself and body in, and wash away your fault and its punishment."" He did so, and scarce had he touched the waters before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the river sands became changed into gold, as they remain to this day. Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendor, dwelt in the country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields. On a certain occasion Pan had the temerity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge the god of the lyre to a trial of skill. The challenge was accepted, and Tmolus, the mountain god, was chosen umpire. The senior took his seat, and cleared away the trees from his ears to listen. At a given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower Midas, who happened to be present. Then Tmolus turned his head toward the Sun-god, and all his trees turned with him. Apollo rose, his brow wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground. In his left hand he held the lyre, and with his right hand struck the strings. Ravished with the harmony, Tmolus at once awarded the victory to the god of the lyre, and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment. He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer to wear the human form, but caused them to increase in length, grow hairy, within and without, and movable on their roots; in short, to be on the perfect pattern of those of an ass. Mortified enough was King Midas at this mishap: but he consoled himself with the thought that it was possible to hide his misfortune, which he attempted to do by means of an ample turban or head-dress. But his hairdresser of course knew the secret. He was charged not to mention it, and threatened with dire punishment if he presumed to disobey. But he found it too much for his discretion to keep such a secret; so he went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, and stooping down, whispered the story, and covered it up. Before long a thick bed of reeds sprang up in the meadow, and as soon as it had gained its growth, began whispering the story, and has continued to do so, from that day to this, every time a breeze passes over the place.",Greece,"Source: Thomas Bulfinch, The Age of Fable (1855), chapter 6.","Bulfinch's source: Ovid, Metamorphoses, book 11, and other classical writers.",NA
Midas,0782,The Child with the Ears of an Ox,"Once upon a time a son was born to a certain raja, and the child had the ears of an ox. The raja was very much ashamed and let no one know. But the secret could not be kept from the barber who had to perform the ceremony of shaving the child's head. However, the raja made the barber vow not to tell anyone of what he had seen. So the barber went away, but the secret which he might not tell had an unfortunate effect. It made his stomach swell to an enormous size. As the barber went along in this unhappy condition he met a Dom [member of a low caste, comprising scavangers, basketmakers, and drummers] who asked why his stomach was so swollen. The barber said that it was because he had shaved the raja's child and had seen that it had the ears of an ox. Directly he had broken his vow and blurted out the secret, his stomach returned to its usual size. The Dom went his way and cut down a tree and made a drum out of the wood, and went about playing on the drum and begging. He came to the raja's palace, and there he drummed and sang: When the raja heard this, he was very angry, and swore to punish the barber who must have broken his vow. But the Dom assured the raja that he knew nothing about the matter, that it was the drum that sang the words and not he, and that he had no idea what they meant. So the raja was pacified, and the barber was not punished.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 53, p. 171.",NA,NA
Midas,0782,The Goat's Ears of the Emperor Trojan,"Once upon a time there lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat. Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if the man saw anything odd about him, and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat's ears, he was at once ordered to be put to death. Now after this state of things had lasted a good while, there was hardly a barber left in the town that could shave the emperor, and it came to be the turn of the Master of the Company of Barbers to go up to the palace. But, unluckily, at the very moment that he should have set out, the master fell suddenly ill, and told one of his apprentices that he must go in his stead. When the youth was taken to the emperor's bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master. The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honor. The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him. Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat's ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, ""No, nothing at all."" This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, ""Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me."" So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, ""Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats""; but he said nothing about the goat's ears of the emperor. From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody. His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret. ""Well, trust me,"" said the master, ""I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back the earth and come away."" The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, ""The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears."" And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shoveled the earth carefully back and ran lightly home. Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars. Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: ""The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears."" Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace. He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him, ""What have you been saying about me to all my people?"" The culprit tried to defend himself by saying that he had never told anyone what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said. Then the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man's confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it. But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court -- nothing came but the words, ""The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears."" Then the emperor knew that even the earth gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more.",Serbia,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Violet Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1901), pp. 52-54.",Lang's source: Volksmärchen der Serben.,NA
Midas,0782,The King with the Horse's Ears,"The story I'm going to tell you is not to be met every day. I heard little Tom Kennedy, the great schoolmaster of Rossard, say that he read it in the history of Ireland, and that it happened before the people were Christian. It is about a king who had his hair cut only once a year. He lived in some old city on the borders of Carlow and Kilkenny, and his name was a queer one: Lora Lonshach it was. So, as I said, he got his hair cut only once a year, and afterward nothing more was ever heard of the barber who did it. This happened to about seven unlucky fellows, and then no barber would come close the castle for love or money. So the king proclaimed that all the barbers in the country were to draw lots, and if the one who got the short straw would dare to refuse, he would be put to death. The short straw was drawn by a poor widow's son named Thigueen. Fearing that she would never again see her son, the mother ran to the castle and beseeched the king to spare him the fate of the previous barbers. ""You'll get your boy back safe and sound,"" promised the king. The next day the frightened barber reported for duty. ""My good fellow,"" said the king, ""you'll be at liberty to go wherever you please after cutting my hair, but you must swear Dar lamh an Righ (by the king's hand) that you'll never tell anything that has ears and tongue what you see here today."" The king sat down on his throne and took off his hood, revealing two brown horse's ears, quite as long as those of an ass. ""Pick up your scissors and do your job!"" he ordered. The poor lad did as best he could, taking special care not to nick the king's ears. When the job was finished, the king paid him, saying, ""Now, my lad, if I ever hear word of this, I'll make you wish that you had never been born."" The boy returned to his mother, only to fall into bed, deathly ill. She asked him what ailed him, but he gave no answer. Two days later the doctor came. ""I have a secret,"" said poor Thigueen. If I cannot tell it, I'll die, and if I do tell it, I'll not be allowed to live."" When the doctor heard that the secret was not to be told to anyone with a tongue or ears, he said, ""Go into the woods, make a split in the bark of one of the trees, tell your secret into the cut."" The doctor was hardly out of the house when Thigueen got up and went into the woods, not stopping until he reached the middle, a place where two paths crossed one another. At this spot he found a healthy tree, cut a gash in its bark, and then whispered into it, ""Da Chluais Chapail ar Labhradh Loingseach,"" which means, ""The two ears of a horse has Lora Lonshach."" The poor fellow had hardly whispered these words when he felt as if a mountain had been lifted off his back. Before a year passed, when again it would be time for the king's haircut, a great harp-playing match was announced, a contest between Craftine, the king's harper, and anyone who dared play against him. The other four kings of Ireland were invited, as well as all the lords and ladies who chose to travel so far. One week before the appointed day, Craftine found a crack in his harp, so he went into the forest to look for wood for a new one. Where should bad luck send him but to the very tree that Thigueen had told his secret to! Craftine cut it down and fashioned it into the finest harp you have ever seen, and when he tried it, he himself was enchanted with its beautiful music. The great day came at last, and the big hall in the palace was crammed. The king was on his high throne, with the four other kings before him. On either side were all the great lords and ladies, around the open place in the center where the harpers were sitting. Craftine began. He first played so mournfully that all who heard him were grief-stricken. Then he played a merry jig, and because there was no room to dance, everyone shouted out for joy. Next came a war-like march, and everyone who had room drew his sword and waved it over his head, each one crying out the war-cry of his own chief or king. Finally he played a beautiful heavenly tune, and they all closed their eyes, hoping that the beautiful music would never come to an end. When Craftine finally ceased playing, gold and silver were thrown in showers to him. Then the harpers of Leinster, Munster, Connaught, and Ulster tried their hands, and, sure enough, they played very well, but not nearly as well as Craftine. When they were finished, the king said to Craftine, ""Give us one more tune to finish decently, and put all that we invited in good humor for their dinner."" ""I am afraid of my harp,"" answered Craftine. ""It wasn't my fingers that struck out the music, but the music that stirred my fingers. There is magic in that harp, and I fear it will play us some trick."" ""Trick be hanged!"" said the king. ""Play away!"" The harper had to obey his king, and he took up his harp, but he had hardly touched the strings, when a loud voice came from them, shouting, ""Da Chluais Chapail ar Labhradh Loingseach!"" The startled king put his hands to his head, not knowing what he was doing, and in his fumbling he loosened the bands of his hood, revealing the two long hairy ears. What a roar came from the crowd! King Lora was not able to stand it, and in a trance he fell down from his throne. In a few minutes he had the hall to himself, except for his harper and some of his old servants. They say that when he came to himself, he was very sorry for all the poor barbers that he had put out of the way, and that he pensioned their wives and mothers. From then on Thigueen was no more concerned about giving the king a haircut than he would have been about giving one to you or to me.",Ireland,"Source: Abstracted from Patrick Kennedy, Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts, 2nd edition (London and New York: Macmillan and Company, 1891, pp. 219-225.",NA,NA
Midas,0782,The Presidente Who Had Horns,"Once there was a presidente [headman of a town] who was very unjust to his people, and one day he became so angry that he wished he had horns so that he might frighten them. No sooner had he made this rash wish, than horns began to grow on his head. He sent for a barber who came to his house to cut his hair, and as he worked the presidente asked, ""What do you see on my head?"" ""I see nothing,"" answered the barber; for although he could see the horns plainly, he was afraid to say so. Soon, however, the presidente put up his hands and felt the horns, and then when he inquired again the barber told him that he had two horns. ""If you tell anyone what you have seen, you shall be hanged,"" said the presidente as the barber started away, and he was greatly frightened. When he reached home, the barber did not intend to tell anyone, for he was afraid; but as he thought of his secret more and more, the desire to tell someone became so strong that he knew he could not keep it. Finally he went to the field and dug a hole under some bamboo, and when the hole was large enough he crawled in and whispered that the presidente had horns. He then climbed out, filled up the hole, and went home. By and by some people came along the road on their way to market, and as they passed the bamboo they stopped in amazement, for surely a voice came from the trees, and it said that the presidente had horns. These people hastened to market and told what they had heard, and the people there went to the bamboo to listen to the strange voice. They informed others, and soon the news had spread all over the town. The councilmen were told, and they, too, went to the bamboo. When they had heard the voice, they ran to the house of the presidente. But his wife said that he was ill and they could not see him. By this time the horns had grown until they were one foot in length, and the presidente was so ashamed that he bade his wife tell the people that he could not talk. She told this to the councilmen when they came on the following day, but they replied that they must see him, for they had heard that he had horns, and if this were true he had no right to govern the people. She refused to let them in, so they broke down the door. They saw the horns of the head of the presidente and killed him. For, they said, he was no better than an animal.",Philippines (Ilocano),"Source: Mabel Cook Cole, Philippine Folk Tales (Chicago: A. C. McClurg and Company, 1916), pp. 181-182.","Note by Cole: Here we have an excellent illustration of how a story brought in by the Spaniards has been worked over into Philippine setting. This is doubtless the classical story of Midas, but since the ass is practically unknown in the Philippines, horns (probably carabao horns) have been substituted for the ass's ears, which grew on Midas' head. Likewise the bamboo, which grows in abundance, takes the place of the reeds in the original tale.",NA
The Monkey's Heart,0091,Brother Rabbit and the Gizzard-Eater,"Brer Rabbit was a mighty man at a frolic. I don't expect he'd show up much in these days, but in the times when the creatures were bossing their own jobs, Brer Rabbit was up for pretty nigh everything that was going on, if there wasn't too much work in it. There couldn't be a dance or a quilting anywhere around but what he'd be there. He was the first to come and the last to go. Well, there was one time when he went too far and stayed too late, because a big rain came during the time when they were playing and dancing, and when Brer Rabbit put out for home, he found that a big freshet had come and gone. The drains had got to be creeks, the creeks had got to be rivers, and the rivers -- well, I'm not going to tell you what the rivers were, because you'd think that I'd told the truth good-bye. By making big jumps and going out of his way, Brer Rabbit managed to get as close to home as the creek, but when he got there, the creek was so wide that it made him feel like he'd been lost so long that his family had forgotten him. Many and many a time he'd crossed that creek on a log, but the log was gone, and the water was spread out all over creation. The water was wide, but that wasn't more than half -- it looked like it was the wettest water that Brer Rabbit had ever laid eyes on. There was a ferry there for times like this, but it looked like it was a bigger freshet than what they had counted on. Brer Rabbit, he sat on the bank and wiped the damp out of his face and eyes, and then he hollered for the man that ran the ferry. He hollered and hollered, and by and by he heard someone answer him, and he looked a little closer, and there was the man -- his name was Jerry -- way up in the top limbs of a tree. And he looked still closer, and he saw that Jerry had company, because there was old Brer Bear sitting at the foot of the tree waiting for Jerry to come down, so he could tell him howdy. Well, sir, Brer Rabbit took notice that there was something more than dampness between them, and he started to holler again, and he hollered so loud and he hollered so long that he woke up old Brer Alligator. Now it didn't make old Brer Alligator feel good to be woken up at that hour, because he'd just had a nice supper of pine-nuts and sweet potatoes and was lying out at full length on his mud bed. He allowed to himself, he did, ""Who in the nation is this trying to holler the bottom out of the creek?"" He listened, and then he turned over and listened again. He shut one eye, and then he shut the other one, but there was no sleeping in that neighborhood. Jerry in the tree, he hollered back, ""Can't come -- got company!"" Brer Alligator, he heard this, and he said to himself that if nobody else can come, he can, and he rose to the top with no more fuss than a featherbed makes when you leave it alone. He rose, he did, and his two eyes looked exactly like two bullets floating on the water. He rose and winked his eye and asked Brer Rabbit howdy, and more especially how was his daughter. Brer Rabbit, he said that there was no telling how his daughter was, because when he left home her head was swelling. He said that some of the neighbors' children had come and flung rocks at her and one of them had hit her on top of the head right where the cowlick is, and he had had to run after the doctor. Brer Alligator allowed, ""You don't tell me, Brer Rabbit, that it's come to this! Your children getting chunked by your neighbors' children. Well, well, well! I wish you'd tell me where it's all going to end. Why it'll get after a while that there's no peace anywhere except at my house in the bed of the creek."" Brer Rabbit said, ""Isn't it the truth? And not only do Brer Fox's children chunk my children on their cowlicks, but no sooner have I gone after the doctor than here comes the creek a-rising. I may be wrong, but I'm not scared to say that it beats anything I have ever laid eyes on. Over yonder in the far wood is where my daughter is lying with a headache, and here is her pa, and between us is the boiling creek. If I were to try to wade, ten to one the water would be over my head, and if that's not bad, all the pills that the doctor gave me would melt in my pocket. And they might poison me, because the doctor didn't say that they were to be taken outside."" Old Brer Alligator floated on the water like he didn't weigh more than one of these here postage stamps, and he tried to drop a tear. He groaned, he did, and floated backwards and forwards like a tired canoe. He said, ""Brer Rabbit, if there ever was a rover, you are one. Up you come and off you go, and there is no more keeping up with you than if you had wings. If you think you can stay in one place long enough, I'll try to put you across the creek."" Brer Rabbit kind of rubbed his chin while he wiggled his nose. He allowed, said he, ""Brer Gator, how deep is that water that you are floating in?"" Brer Alligator said, ""Brer Rabbit, if my old woman and I were to join heads, and I were to stand on the tip end of my tail, there'd still be room enough for all of my children before we touched bottom."" Brer Rabbit, he fell back like he was going to faint. He allowed, ""Brer Gator, you don't tell me! You surely don't mean those last words! Why you make me feel like I'm further from home than those who are done lost for good! How in the name of goodness are you going to put me across this slippery water?"" Brer Alligator, he blew a bubble or two out of his nose, and then he said, ""If you can stand still in one place long enough, I'm going to take you across on my back. You needn't say ""thank you,"" but I want you to know that I'm not everybody's water-horse."" Brer Rabbit allowed, said he, ""I can well believe that, Brer Gator, but somehow I kind of got a notion that your tail is mighty limber. I hear old folks say that you can knock a chip from the back of your head with the tip end of your tail and never half try."" Brer Alligator smacked his mouth and said, ""Limber my tail may be, Brer Rabbit, and far reaching, but don't blame me. It was that way when it was given to me. It's all jointed up according to nature."" Brer Rabbit, he studied and he studied, and the more he studied, the worse he liked it. But he pleased to go home -- there were no two ways about that -- and he allowed, said he, ""I suspect what you say is somewhere in the neighborhood of the truth, Brer Gator, and more than that, I believe that I'll go along with you. If you'll ride up a little closer, I'll make up my mind, so I won't keep you waiting."" Brer Alligator, he floated by the side of the bank the same as a cork out of a pickle bottle. He didn't do like he was in a hurry, because he dropped a word or two about the weather, and he said that the water was mighty cold down there in the slushes. But Brer Rabbit took notice that when he smiled one of his smiles, he showed up a double row of tusks that looked like they'd do mighty good work in a sawmill. Brer Rabbit, he began to shake like he was having a chill. He allowed, ""I feel that damp, Brer Gator, that I might just as well be in water up to my chin!"" Brer Alligator didn't say anything, but he couldn't hide his tusks. Brer Rabbit looked up, he looked down, and he looked all around. He scarcely knew what to do. He allowed, ""Brer Gator, your back is mighty rough. How am I going to ride on it?"" Brer Alligator said, ""The roughness will help you to hold on, because you'll have to ride a-straddle. You can just get your feet on the bumps and kind of brace yourself when you think you see a log floating at us. You can just sit up there the same as if you were sitting at home in your rocking chair. Brer Rabbit shook his head, but he got on, he did, and he had no sooner gotten on than he wished mighty hard that he was off. Brer Alligator said, ""You can pant if you want to, but I'll do the paddling,"" and he slipped through the water just like he was greased. Brer Rabbit sure was scared, but he kept his eyes open, and by and by he took notice that Brer Alligator wasn't making for the place where the landing was at, and he up and said so. He allowed, ""Brer Gator, if I'm not much mistaken, you're not heading for the landing."" Brer Alligator said, ""You sure have got mighty good eyes, Brer Rabbit. I've been waiting for you a long time, and I'm the worst kind of waiter. I must know you haven't forgot that day in the stubble when you said you were going to show me Old Man Trouble. Well, you didn't only show him to me, but you made me shake hands with him. You set the dry grass afire and burned me scandalously. That's the reason my back is so rough, and that's the reason my hide is so tough. Well, I've been a-waiting since that time, and now here you are. You burned me until I had to quench the burning in the big quagmire."" Brer Alligator laughed, but he had the laugh all on his side, because that was one of the times when Brer Rabbit didn't feel like giggling. He sat there a-shaking and a-shivering. By and by he allowed, said he, ""What are you going to do, Brer Gator?"" Brer Alligator said, ""It looks to me like since you set the dry grass afire, I've been having symptoms. That's what the doctor said. He looked at my tongue, and he felt my pulse, and he shook his head. He said that beings he's my friend, he didn't mind telling me that my symptoms are getting worse than what they have been, and if I don't take something I'll be falling into one of these here inclines that make folks flabby and weak."" Brer Rabbit, he shook and he shivered. He allowed, ""What else did the doctor say, Brer Gator?"" Brer Alligator kept on a-slipping along. He said, ""The doctor didn't only look at my tongue. He measured my breath, and he hit me on my bosom -- tip-tap-tap! -- and he said there was but one thing that will cure me. I asked him what it is, and he said it's rabbit gizzard."" Brer Alligator slipped and slid along and waited to see what Brer Rabbit was going to say to that. He didn't have to wait long, because Brer Rabbit did his thinking like one of these here machines that has lightning in it. He allowed, he said, ""It's a mighty good thing you struck up with me this day, Brer Gator, because I have exactly the kind of physic you are looking for. All the neighbors say I'm mighty queer, and I suspect I am, but queer or not queer, I've long been looking for the gizzard-eater."" Brer Alligator didn't say anything. He just slid through the water and listened to what Brer Rabbit was saying. Brer Rabbit allowed, he said, ""The last time I took sick the doctor came in a hurry, and he sat up with me all night -- not a wink of sleep did that man get. He said he could tell by the way I was going on, rolling and tossing, and moaning and groaning, that no physic was going to do me any good. I've never seen a doctor scratch his head like that doctor did. He acted like he was stumped, he sure did. He said he had never seen anybody with my kind of trouble, and he went off and called in one of his brer doctors, and the two knocked their heads together, and they said my trouble all comes from having a double gizzard. When my old woman heard that she just flung her apron over her head and fell back in a dead faint, and a little more and I'd have had to pay a doctor bill on her account. When she squalled, some of my children got scared and took to the wood, and they hadn't all got back when I left home last night."" Brer Alligator, he just went a-slipping along through the water. He listened, but he didn't say anything. Brer Rabbit allowed, said he, ""It's the fatal truth, all this that I'm a-telling you. The doctor, he flew around until he fetched my old woman to, and then he said there was no need to be skittish on account of my having a double gizzard, because all I had to do was to be kind of careful with my chewings and gnawings, and my comings and goings. He said that I'd have to suffer with it until I find the gizzard-eater. I asked him whereabouts he is, and he said that I'd know him when I see him, and if I fail to know him, he'll make himself known to me. This kind of irritates me, because when a man's a doctor, and he's got the idea of curing anybody, there is no need of dealing in riddles. But he said that there was no use in telling all you know, especially before dinner."" Brer Alligator went a-sliding along through the water. He listened and smacked his mouth, but he didn't say anything. Brer Rabbit, he talked on. He allowed, said he, ""And there was one thing he told me plainer than all the rest. He said that when anybody was afflicted with the double gizzard, they daresn't cross water with it, because if there's anything that a double gizzard won't stand, it's the smell of water."" Brer Alligator went slipping along through the water, but he felt like the time had come when he pleased to say something. He said, ""How come you are crossing water now, if the doctor told you that?"" This made Brer Rabbit laugh. He allowed, ""Maybe I oughtn't tell you, but before I can cross water, that double gizzard has got to come out. The doctor told me that if she ever smells water, there'll be such a swelling up that my skin won't hold me. And no longer ago than last night, before I came to cross this creek -- it was a creek then, whatsoever you may call it now -- I took out my double gizzard and hid it in a hickory hollow. And if you are the gizzard-eater, now is your chance, because if you put it off, you may rue the day. If you are in the notion, I'll take you right there and show you the stump where I hid it at -- and if you want to be lonesome about it, I'll let you go by yourself and I'll stay right here."" Brer Alligator, he slipped and slid through the water. He said, ""Where'd you say you'd stay?"" Brer Rabbit allowed, said he, ""I'll stay right here, Brer Gator, or anywhere else you may choose. I don't care much where I stay or what I do, so long as I get rid of that double gizzard that's been a-terrifying me. You better go by yourself, because bad as that double gizzard has done me, I got kind of a tendersome feeling for it, and I'm afraid if I were to go along with you and see you grab it, there'd be some boo-hooing done. If you go by yourself, just rap on the stump and say, 'If you are ready, I'm ready and a little more so,' and you won't have any trouble with her. She's hid right in those woods yonder, and the hollow hickory stump isn't so mighty far from where the bank of the creek ought to be."" Brer Gator didn't have much more sense than what it'd take to climb a fence after someone had pulled it down, and so he kind of slewed himself around and steered for the woods -- the same woods where there are so many trees, and where old Sis Owl starts all the whirlwinds by fanning her wings. Brer Alligator swam and steered until he came close to land, and when he did that, Brer Rabbit made a big jump and landed on solid ground. He might have got his feet wet, but if he did, that was all.

The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Foolish Dragon,"The part of the great Buddha legend referring to the dragon is as follows: In years gone by, a dragon living in the great sea saw that his wife's health was not good. He, seeing her color fade away, said, ""My dear, what shall I get you to eat?"" Mrs. Dragon was silent. ""Just tell me and I will get it,"" pleaded the affectionate husband. ""You cannot do it; why trouble?"" quoth she. ""Trust me, and you shall have your heart's desire,"" said the dragon. ""Well,"" I want a monkey's heart to eat."" ""Why, Mrs. Dragon, the monkeys live in the mountain forests! How can I get one of their hearts?"" ""Well, I am going to die; I know I am."" Forthwith the dragon went on shore, and, spying a monkey on the top of a tree, said, ""Hail, shining one, are you not afraid you will fall?"" ""No, I have no such fear."" ""Why eat of one tree? Cross the sea and you will find forests of fruit and flowers."" ""How can I cross?"" ""Get on my back."" The dragon with his tiny load went seaward, and then suddenly dived down. ""Where are you going?"" said the monkey, with the salt water in his eyes and mouth. ""Oh! my dear sir! my wife is very sad and ill, and has taken a fancy to your heart."" ""What shall I do?"" thought the monkey. He then spoke, ""Illustrious friend, why did not you tell me? I left my heart on the top of the tree; take me back, and I will get it for Mrs. Dragon."" The dragon returned to the shore. As the monkey was tardy in coming down from the tree, the dragon said, ""Hurry up, little friend, I am waiting."" Then the monkey thought within himself, ""What a fool this dragon is!"" Then Buddha said to his followers, ""At this time I was the monkey.""",China,"Source: E. T. C.

The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Heart of a Monkey,"A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big gray monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight. After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably, he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes. ""Can I do anything for you, my friend?"" asked the monkey politely. ""Oh! if you only would throw me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful,"" answered the shark. ""After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt."" ""Well, I don't like salt myself,"" said the monkey, ""so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,"" and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so easy to hit the shark's mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in. ""Ah, how good!"" cried the shark. ""Send me another, please,"" and the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them. ""It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,"" he said, at length, ""but if you are here at the same time tomorrow I will give you another treat."" ""Thank you, thank you,"" said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight. ""You can't guess how happy you have made me,"" and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again. For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know. By and by the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels. And the monkey, as he listened, grew more and more gloomy. Matters were in this state when one day the shark said, ""I really hardly know how to thank you for your kindness to me during these weeks. Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy."" ""I should like nothing better,"" cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased. ""But how could I get there? Not by water, Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!"" ""Oh! don't let that trouble you,"" replied the shark. ""You have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you."" So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree, and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash. After a few minutes -- for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position -- the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the seaweeds and the oddly shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself. The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, ""My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something."" ""What is it?"" asked the monkey. ""Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound rather grave."" ""Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure him is a monkey's heart."" ""Poor man, I am very sorry for him,"" replied the monkey; ""but you were unwise not to tell me till we had started."" ""What do you mean?"" asked the shark. But the monkey, who now understood the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he should say. ""Why are you so silent?"" inquired the shark again. ""I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me."" ""Your heart! Why isn't your heart here?"" said the shark, with a puzzled expression. ""Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don't know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won't believe that, and will just think I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me."" The monkey spoke in such a calm indifferent way that the shark was quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry. ""But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you,"" he said at last. ""We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch it."" Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to seem too pleased. ""Well, I don't know,"" he remarked carelessly. ""It is such a long way; but you may be right."" ""I am sure I am,"" answered the shark, ""and I will swim as quickly as I can,"" and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water. With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up. ""Wait for me here,"" he called out to the shark. ""I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart,"" and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep. ""Are you there?"" cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone. The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer. ""Are you there?"" called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very cross voice. ""Oh, yes. I am here,"" replied the monkey; ""but I wish you had not wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap."" ""Have you got it?"" asked the shark. ""It is time we were going."" ""Going where?"" inquired the monkey. ""Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You can't have forgotten!"" ""My dear friend,"" answered the monkey, with a chuckle, ""I think you must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman's donkey?"" ""Don't talk nonsense,"" exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed at. ""What do you mean about a washerman's donkey? And I wish you would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan."" ""Did you really never hear of the washerman's donkey?"" asked the monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. ""Why, he is the beast who has no heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while the sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come a little nearer and tell you his story."" ""Very well,"" said the shark sulkily, ""if you won't come, I suppose I may as well listen to that as do nothing."" So the monkey began. One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if it was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare happened to pass by. ""Well, that is a fat creature,"" thought she, and turned out of her path to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion had been very ill and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and when the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found only a few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled his eyes. ""What is the good of telling me that?"" he asked in a weepy voice. ""You know I cannot even walk as far as that palm."" ""Never mind,"" answered the hare briskly. ""If you can't go to your dinner, your dinner shall come to you,"" and nodding a farewell to the lion she went back to the donkey. ""Good morning,"" said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her head in surprise. ""Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very important business."" ""Indeed,"" answered the donkey, ""it is most kind of you to take the trouble. May I inquire what the business is?"" ""Certainly,"" replied the hare. ""It is my friend the lion who has heard so much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that you will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply that he is unable to make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak to move."" ""Poor fellow! How sad!"" said the donkey. ""But you must tell him that I feel honored by his proposal and will gladly consent to be Queen of the Beasts."" ""Will you not come and tell him so yourself?"" asked the hare. Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion's house. It took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace. When at last they arrived the lion was sitting up at the entrance, looking very pale and thin. The donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her head, but the lion put on his best manners and invited both his visitors to come in and make themselves comfortable. Very soon the hare go up and said, ""Well, as I have another engagement I will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband,"" and winking at the lion she bounded away. The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he said nothing she looked up. To her surprise and terror she saw him crouching in the corner, his eyes glaring with a red light, and with a loud roar he sprang towards her. But in that moment the donkey had had time to prepare herself, and jumping on one side dealt the lion such a hard kick that he shrieked with the pain. Again and again he struck at her with his claws, but the donkey could bite too, as well as the lion, who was very weak after his illness, and at last a well planted kick knocked him right over, and he rolled on the floor, groaning with pain. The donkey did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she could and was lost in the forest. Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave, where she could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner. ""Well, lion, have you killed her?"" asked she, running swiftly up the path. ""Killed her, indeed!"" answered the lion sulkily, ""it is she who has nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I took care she should carry away the marks of my claws."" ""Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!"" cried the hare. ""But don't vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will soon heal,"" and she bade her friend good-bye, and returned to her family. Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey's back showed where the lion's claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare's head peeped through. ""Ah! there is no need to ask how you are,"" she said. ""Still you mustn't overtire yourself, you know. Shall I go and bring you your dinner?"" ""If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two,"" cried the lion savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand. This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer to find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and ran towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure. ""Good morning,"" said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly onto her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be. ""Oh, it is you, is it?"" she exclaimed. ""Come and have a chat. What news have you got?"" ""I mustn't stay,"" answered the hare; ""but I promised the lion to beg you to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you."" ""Well, I don't know,"" replied the donkey gloomily. ""The last time we went he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid."" ""He was only trying to kiss you,"" said the hare, ""and you bit him, and of course that made him cross."" ""If I were sure of that,"" hesitated the donkey. ""Oh, you may be quite sure,"" laughed the hare. ""I have a large acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick,"" and rather unwillingly the donkey set out. The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him. ""Take this meat and skin it and roast it,"" he said to the hare; ""but my appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your friends."" ""Thank you,"" replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and roasted it. As soon as it was cooked, the hare took out the heart and had just finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up. ""I am hungry,"" said he. ""Bring me the creature's heart. It is just what I want for supper."" ""But there is no heart,"" answered the hare, looking up at the lion with a puzzled face. ""What nonsense!"" said the lion. ""As if every beast had not got a heart. What do you mean?"" ""This is a washerman's donkey,"" replied the hare gravely. ""Well, and suppose it is?"" ""Oh, fie!"" exclaimed the fare. ""You, a lion and a grown-up person, and ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would she have come back a second time? Now would she?"" And the lion answered slowly, ""No, she would not."" ""So you think I am a washerman's donkey?"" said the monkey to the shark, when the story was ended. ""You are wrong. I am not. And as the sun is getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey. You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan better. Farewell!""

The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Jellyfish and the Monkey,"The palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever seen anything like it even in dreams. The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase, and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl. But the Dragon King, in spite of his widespreading kingdom, his beautiful palace and all its wonders, and his power, which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone. At last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful. So he decided to take a wife. Calling all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride. At last they returned to the palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon. Her scales were of a glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and she was dressed in gorgeous robes. All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them. The king fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendour. Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps, came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life. Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the fish-world before. The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other. Each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honour of the event. Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily. They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and gardens. Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day. Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed. The king was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine. He gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse. Then the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the queen. The doctor was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find it in the sea. ""Do you mean to tell me that you can't get the medicine here?"" asked the Dragon King. ""It is just as you say!"" said the doctor. ""Tell me what it is you want for the queen?"" demanded Rin Jin. ""I want the liver of a live monkey!"" answered the doctor. ""The liver of a live monkey! Of course that will be most difficult to get,"" said the king. ""If we could only get that for the queen, Her Majesty would soon recover,"" said the doctor. ""Very well, that decides it; we must get it somehow or other. But where are we most likely to find a monkey?"" asked the king. Then the doctor told the Dragon King that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island where a great many monkeys lived. ""If only you could capture one of those monkeys?"" said the doctor. ""How can any of my people capture a monkey?"" said the Dragon King, greatly puzzled. ""The monkeys live on dry land, while we live in the water; and out of our element we are quite powerless! I don't see what we can do!"" ""That has been my difficulty too,"" said the doctor. ""But amongst your innumerable servants, you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose!"" ""Something must be done,"" said the king, and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter. The chief steward thought for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, said joyfully: ""I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jellyfish). He is certainly ugly to look at, but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one."" The jellyfish was then summoned to the king's presence, and was told by His Majesty what was required of him. The jellyfish, on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be entrusted to him, looked very troubled, and said that he had never been to the island in question, and as he had never had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one. ""Well,"" said the chief steward, ""if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!"" ""How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it,"" said the perplexed jellyfish. ""This is what you must do,"" said the wily chief steward. ""When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!"" ""But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim!"" said the reluctant jellyfish. ""You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!"" said the chief steward. ""Won't he be very heavy?"" queried kurage again. ""You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King!"" replied the chief steward. ""I will do my best then,"" said the jellyfish, and he swam away from the palace and started off towards the Monkey Island. Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and was landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big pine tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for -- a live monkey. ""I'm in luck!"" thought the jellyfish. ""Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the palace, and my part will be done!"" So the jellyfish slowly walked towards the pine tree. In those ancient days the jellyfish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine tree he raised his voice and said: ""How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?"" ""A very fine day,"" answered the monkey from the tree. ""I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?"" ""My name is kurage or jellyfish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it,"" answered the jellyfish. ""I am very glad to see you,"" said the monkey. ""By-the-bye,"" said the jellyfish, ""have you ever seen the palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?"" ""I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!"" answered the monkey. ""Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the palace is beyond all description -- it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,"" said the jellyfish. ""Is it so beautiful as all that?"" asked the monkey in astonishment. Then the jellyfish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty and grandeur of the Sea King's palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees of white, pink, and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on the branches. The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story. ""I have got him at last!"" thought the jellyfish, but aloud he said: ""Mr. Monkey, I must now go back. As you have never seen the palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you -- a land-lubber."" ""I should love to go,"" said the monkey, "" but how am I to cross the water? I can't swim, as you surely know!"" ""There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back."" ""That will be troubling you too much,"" said the monkey. ""I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,"" said the jellyfish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea. ""Keep very still, Mr. Monkey,"" said the jellyfish. ""You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's palace."" ""Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,"" said the monkey. Thus they went along, the jellyfish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back. When they were about half-way, the jellyfish, who knew very little of anatomy, began to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not! ""Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?"" The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jellyfish wanted with a liver. ""That is the most important thing of all,"" said the stupid jellyfish, ""so as soon as I recollected it, I asked you if you had yours with you?"" ""Why is my liver so important to you?"" asked the monkey. ""Oh! you will learn the reason later,"" said the jellyfish. The monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious, and urged the jellyfish to tell him for what his liver was wanted, and ended up by appealing to his hearer's feelings by saying that he was very troubled at what he had been told. Then the jellyfish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him everything. How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one. ""Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the palace the doctor will want your liver, so I feel sorry for you!"" said the silly jellyfish. The poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon him. He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him. But the monkey was a clever animal, and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt, so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape. ""The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!"" thought the monkey. At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jellyfish: ""What a pity it was, Mr. Jellyfish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!"" ""If I had told you why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,"" answered the jellyfish. ""You are quite mistaken,"" said the monkey. ""Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in need, I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine tree."" ""Have you left your liver behind you?"" asked the jellyfish. ""Yes,"" said the cunning monkey, ""during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. Today, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should have brought it along with me!"" The jellyfish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey said. The monkey was of no good without a liver. Finally the jellyfish stopped and told the monkey so. ""Well,"" said the monkey, ""that is soon remedied. I am really sorry to think of all your trouble; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to get my liver."" The jellyfish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver, and bring it with him the next time. Thus persuaded, the jellyfish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more. No sooner had the jellyfish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into the pine tree where the jellyfish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jellyfish said: ""So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon King on your return!"" The jellyfish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered. Then he asked the monkey if it wasn't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver. The monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver; it was too precious. ""But remember your promise!"" pleaded the jellyfish, now very discouraged. ""That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!"" answered the monkey. Then he began to jeer at the jellyfish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jellyfish to return under false pretences. ""Of course, I won't give you my liver, but come and get it if you can!"" added the monkey mockingly from the tree. There was nothing for the jellyfish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and return to the Dragon King of the Sea and confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him. Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jellyfish. When they caught sight of him approaching the palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was. Now the day of reckoning had come for the jellyfish. He quaked all over as he told his story. How he had brought the monkey half-way over the sea, and then had stupidly let out the secret of his commission; how the monkey had deceived him by making him believe that he had left his liver behind him. The Dragon King's wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jellyfish was to be severely punished. The punishment was a horrible one. All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks. The poor jellyfish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the Dragon King's order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jellyfish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness. From this story it is evident that in former times the jellyfish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them today thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan.",Japan,"Source: Yei Theodora Ozaki, The Japanese Fairy Book (Westminster: Archibald Constable and Company, 1903), pp. 189-202.",NA,NA
The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Monkey's Heart,"Once upon a time, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life at the foot of the Himalayas as a monkey. He grew strong and sturdy, big of frame, well to do, and lived by a curve of the river Ganges in a forest haunt. Now at that time there was a crocodile dwelling in the Ganges. The crocodile's mate saw the great frame of the monkey, and she conceived a longing to eat his heart. So she said to her lord, ""Sir, I desire to eat the heart of that great king of the monkeys!"" ""Good wife,"" said the crocodile, ""I live in the water and he lives on dry land. How can we catch him?"" ""By hook or by crook,"" she replied, ""he must be caught. If I don't get him, I shall die."" ""All right,"" answered the crocodile, consoling her, ""don't trouble yourself. I have a plan. I will give you his heart to eat."" So when the Bodhisatta was sitting on the bank of the Ganges, after taking a drink of water, the crocodile drew near, and said, ""Sir Monkey, why do you live on bad fruits in this old familiar place? On the other side of the Ganges there is no end to the mango trees, and labuja trees, with fruit sweet as honey! Is it not better to cross over and have all kinds of wild fruit to eat?"" ""Lord Crocodile,"" the monkey answered. ""The Ganges is deep and wide. How shall I get across?"" ""If you want to go, I will let you sit upon my back, and carry you over."" The monkey trusted him, and agreed. ""Come here, then,"" said the crocodile. ""Up on my back with you!"" and up the monkey climbed. But when the crocodile had swum a little way, he plunged the monkey under the water. ""Good friend, you are letting me sink!"" cried the monkey. ""What is that for?"" The crocodile said, ""You think I am carrying you out of pure good nature? Not a bit of it! My wife has a longing for your heart, and I want to give it to her to eat.!"" ""Friend,"" said the monkey, ""it is nice of you to tell me. Why, if our heart were inside us, when we go jumping among the tree tops it would be all knocked to pieces!"" ""Well, where do you keep it?"" asked the crocodile. The Bodhisatta pointed out a fig tree, with clusters of ripe fruit, standing not far off. ""See,"" said he, ""there are our hearts hanging on yonder fig tree."" ""If you will show me your heart,"" said the crocodile, ""then I won't kill you."" ""Take me to the tree, then, and I will point it out to you."" The crocodile brought him to the place. The monkey leapt off his back, and, climbing up the fig tree, sat upon it. ""Oh silly crocodile!"" said he. ""You thought that there were creatures that kept their hearts in a treetop! You are a fool, and I have outwitted you! You may keep your fruit to yourself. Your body is great, but you have no sense."" And then to explain this idea he uttered the following stanzas: The crocodile, feeling as sad and miserable as if he had lost a thousand pieces of money, went back sorrowing to the place where he lived.","India, Jataka Tales","Source: The Jataka; or, Stories of the Buddha's Former Births, edited by E.

The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Monkey and the Crocodile,"""Friend Crocodile,"" said he, ""are you tired of life that you have come so close into land?"" The crocodile heard what the monkey said and replied: ""He who has a situation that suits him, he who receives due wages for his services, is perfectly content with the place in which he happens to be. For it has been said: Lanka is altogether made of gold, yet I care nothing for it. Ayodhya, the home of my fathers, is but poor, yet I delight in it. But there is something more than that, for your acquaintance has added additional pleasure to my existence. For it is written: A sacred bathing-place is only profitable sometimes. But the mere sight of a good man is always a source of purification. So now a piece of luck has happened to me, in that I have come across one who speaks such kindly words as you."" ""My dear Crocodile,"" answered the monkey,"" from this day forward I shall be entirely devoted to you, for your words are indeed the words of friendship. As it has been said: Friendship, in the opinion of wise men, is the society of the good. Therefore,"" continued the monkey, ""let me offer you such hospitality as I am capable of."" So saying he brought the crocodile some ripe fruit as sweet as nectar. So after this every day the monkey used to bring his friend the crocodile plaintain fruit, and the crocodile took it home to his wife. One day she asked him where this fruit came from, and he told her the whole story, exactly as it all happened. She thought to herself, ""This monkey seems to enjoy excellent fruit, I wonder what his ordinary food is like,"" and so, being in a condition which gave her a craving for all sorts of strange out-of-the-way things, she said to her husband: ""I must have some of that fruit which the monkey is always eating; if you don't get it for me I shall certainly die."" So off the crocodile started on his errand, and soon arrived at the river bank where he had met the monkey the first time. The monkey was there, and the crocodile said to him, ""My dear friend! Your brother's wife is very anxious to see you; will you come with me to our house?"" The monkey accepted the invitation, and without any hesitation mounted the crocodile's back, and they started on their journey. On the way the monkey became a little anxious, and said: ""It has occurred to me how am I to find my way back?"" The crocodile recognized the monkey's difficulty, and explained carefully to him the way home. The monkey replied, ""My good crocodile! It is of no use your telling me all this, I am sure I should not recollect it. Besides, I think my affection for you has something lessened, so it is of no use my going home with you."" The crocodile rejoined, ""Well, where shall I put you down?"" ""My dear friend!"" answered the monkey, ""haven't you heard the saying: My heart is always in the fig tree; my desire always for the sacred fig? If you know what that means you will take me back at once."" The stupid crocodile at these words turned round and took the monkey back to the river bank, and as soon as they had got there, the monkey jumped off the crocodile's back, and scrambled up into the tree. When he was well out of reach, he turned round and said with a jeer, ""Go along with you! As long as I am up here I am out of your clutches. Wise men say, There can be no friendship between creatures that live on land and those that live in the water."" So the crocodile turned back and went sadly home, and the moral is: That he who has wit enough, can get out of difficulties, whatever they may be.","India, Suka Saptati; or, Seventy Tales of a Parrot","Source: The Enchanted Parrot: Being a Selection from the ""Suka Saptati,"" or, The Seventy Tales of a Parrot, translated by B.

The Monkey's Heart,0091,The Monkey and the Jellyfish,"Children must often have wondered why jellyfishes have no shells, like so many of the creatures that are washed up every day on the beach. In old times this was not so; the jellyfish had as hard a shell as any of them, but he lost it through his own fault, as may be seen in this story. The sea-queen Otohime grew suddenly very ill. The swiftest messengers were sent hurrying to fetch the best doctors from every country under the sea, but it was all of no use; the queen grew rapidly worse instead of better. Everyone had almost given up hope, when one day a doctor arrived who was cleverer than the rest, and said that the only thing that would cure her was the liver of an ape. Now apes do not dwell under the sea, so a council of the wisest heads in the nation was called to consider the question how a liver could be obtained. At length it was decided that the turtle, whose prudence was well known, should swim to land and contrive to catch a living ape and bring him safely to the ocean kingdom. It was easy enough for the council to entrust this mission to the turtle, but not at all so easy for him to fulfil it. However, he swam to a part of the coast that was covered with tall trees, where he thought the apes were likely to be; for he was old, and had seen many things. It was some time before he caught sight of any monkeys, and he often grew tired with watching for them, so that one hot day he fell fast asleep, in spite of all his efforts to keep awake. By and by some apes, who had been peeping at him from the tops of the trees, where they had been carefully hidden from the turtle's eyes, stole noiselessly down, and stood round staring at him, for they had never seen a turtle before, and did not know what to make of it. At last one young monkey, bolder than the rest, stooped down and stroked the shining shell that the strange new creature wore on its back. The movement, gentle though it was, woke the turtle. With one sweep he seized the monkey's hand in his mouth, and held it tight, in spite of every effort to pull it away. The other apes, seeing that the turtle was not to be trifled with, ran off, leaving their young brother to his fate. Then the turtle said to the monkey, ""If you will be quiet, and do what I tell you, I won't hurt you. But you must get on my back and come with me."" The monkey, seeing there was no help for it, did as he was bid; indeed he could not have resisted, as his hand was still in the turtle's mouth. Delighted at having secured his prize, the turtle hastened back to the shore and plunged quickly into the water. He swam faster than he had ever done before, and soon reached the royal palace. Shouts of joy broke forth from the attendants when he was seen approaching, and some of them ran to tell the queen that the monkey was there, and that before long she would be as well as ever she was. In fact, so great was their relief that they gave the monkey such a kind welcome, and were so anxious to make him happy and comfortable, that he soon forgot all the fears that had beset him as to his fate, and was generally quite at his ease, though every now and then a fit of homesickness would come over him, and he would hide himself in some dark corner till it had passed away. It was during one of these attacks of sadness that a jellyfish happened to swim by. At that time jellyfishes had shells. At the sight of the gay and lively monkey crouching under a tall rock, with his eyes closed and his head bent, the jellyfish was filled with pity, and stopped, saying, ""Ah, poor fellow, no wonder you weep; a few days more, and they will come and kill you and give your liver to the queen to eat."" The monkey shrank back horrified at these words and asked the jellyfish what crime he had committed that deserved death. ""Oh, none at all,"" replied the jellyfish, ""but your liver is the only thing that will cure our queen, and how can we get at it without killing you? You had better submit to your fate, and make no noise about it, for though I pity you from my heart there is no way of helping you."" Then he went away, leaving the ape cold with horror. At first he felt as if his liver was already being taken from his body, but soon he began to wonder if there was no means of escaping this terrible death, and at length he invented a plan which he thought would do. For a few days he pretended to be gay and happy as before, but when the sun went in, and rain fell in torrents, he wept and howled from dawn to dark, till the turtle, who was his head keeper, heard him, and came to see what was the matter. Then the monkey told him that before he left home he had hung his liver out on a bush to dry, and if it was always going to rain like this it would become quite useless. And the rogue made such a fuss and moaning that he would have melted a heart of stone, and nothing would content him but that somebody should carry him back to land and let him fetch his liver again. The queen's councilors were not the wisest of people, and they decided between them that the turtle should take the monkey back to his native land and allow him to get his liver off the bush, but desired the turtle not to lose sight of his charge for a single moment. The monkey knew this, but trusted to his power of beguiling the turtle when the time came, and mounted on his back with feelings of joy, which he was, however, careful to conceal. They set out, and in a few hours were wandering about the forest where the ape had first been caught, and when the monkey saw his family peering out from the tree tops, he swung himself up by the nearest branch, just managing to save his hind leg from being seized by the turtle. He told them all the dreadful things that had happened to him, and gave a war cry which brought the rest of the tribe from the neighboring hills. At a word from him they rushed in a body to the unfortunate turtle, threw him on his back, and tore off the shield that covered his body. Then with mocking words they hunted him to the shore, and into the sea, which he was only too thankful to reach alive. Faint and exhausted he entered the queen's palace, for the cold of the water struck upon his naked body, and made him feel ill and miserable. But wretched though he was, he had to appear before the queen's advisers and tell them all that had befallen him, and how he had suffered the monkey to escape. But, as sometimes happens, the turtle was allowed to go scot-free, and had his shell given back to him, and all the punishment fell on the poor jellyfish, who was condemned by the queen to go shieldless for ever after.",Japan,"Source: Andrew Lang, The Violet Fairy Book (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1901), pp. 275-280.",Lang identifies his source only as a book entitled Japanische Märchen.,NA

Some of them said, ""Do not you know? The monkeys must form a chain, and so draw the moon out."" So they formed a chain, the first monkey hanging on to the branch of a tree, and the second to the first monkey's tail, and a third one in its turn to the tail of the second one. When in this way they were all hanging on to one another, the branch began to bend a good deal. The water became troubled, the reflection of the moon disappeared, the branch broke, and all the monkeys fell into the well and were disagreeably damaged.

"Every Mother Thinks Her Child Is the Most
Beautiful",0247,The Crow and Its Ugly Fledglings,"Of all the birds the crow is considered the ugliest, especially its young fledglings. The legend tells that sometime after God had created all the living beings, he called everyone to see them and their offspring. He wanted to see how the young birds and animals looked, and then to give them suitable gifts, and food for their little ones. They came one by one, and God looked at them, patted some and stroked others, and was very pleased with every one of them, for each one had something of beauty in it. And so he blessed them and gave them food by which to live. The last to come was the crow, bringing her little brood with her, very proud of them. When God cast his eyes upon the young crows, he spat in astonishment, and said, ""Surely these are not my creatures. I could not have made such ugly things. Every one of my creatures has such beautiful young ones that they are a pleasure to look at, but yours are so ugly that it makes one sick to look at them. Where did you get this one?"" ""Where should I get them from?"" replied the crow. ""It is my very own young child,"" she added with pride. ""You had better go back and bring me another one. This is much too ugly. I cannot look at it."" Annoyed at the words of God, the crow went away and flew all over the earth to search for another young one that would be more beautiful than the one she had brought to God. But no other young bird appeared so beautiful in her eyes as her own. So she returned back to God and said, ""I have been all over the world, and I have searched high and low, but young birds more beautiful and more dainty than mine I have not been able to find."" Then God smilingly replied, ""Quite right. Just so are all mothers. No other child is so beautiful in their eyes as their own."" Then he blessed the little crows and sent them away into the world with his gifts.",Romania,"Source (Internet Archive): M.

"Every Mother Thinks Her Child Is the Most
Beautiful",0247,Why Is There Enmity Between the Crow and the Hawk?,"The crow was in very great distress, for however she tried and whatever she did, she could not rear a family. No sooner were the young hatched, than the hawk would come and pick them up. In vain did she try to hide her nest in the hollows of a tree or in the thickets of a bush. As sure as death would the hawk find them and eat them. Not knowing what to do, she bethought herself and said, ""How would it do if I try and get the hawk to be godmother? For then, being a near relation, she is sure to spare my little ones."" Said and done. She went out of her place to search for the hawk, and finding her, she said, ""Good morning, sister."" ""Good morning,"" replied the hawk. ""How pleased I should feel,"" said the crow, ""if you would become godmother to my children."" ""With pleasure,"" replied the hawk. ""Why not?"" And so they made up a covenant of friendship and of good fellowship between them. Before leaving the hawk, the crow said to her, ""Now, sister, I have one request to make."" ""Granted,"" replied the hawk. ""What is it?"" ""I only beg of you to spare my children. Do not eat them when you have found them."" ""All right,"" replied the hawk. ""I shall certainly not touch them. But tell me how they look, so that in case I meet them, I may spare them."" ""Oh,"" replied the crow, ""mine are the most beautiful creatures in the world. They are more lovely than any other bird can boast of."" ""Very well. Rest assured. Go in peace."" And they parted. The crow, being quite satisfied with the hawk's promise, began flying about the next day trying to find something with which to feed her children. The hawk the next morning went about her own business and tried to find some nice little young ones to eat. Flying about, she saw the young ones of the thrush, the blackbird, and of other beautiful birds, and she said to herself, ""Surely these are the children of the crow. Look how lovely and beautiful they are. I am not going to touch them."" She went all day without finding any little birds but these. And she said to herself, ""I must keep my word to my sister. I am not going to touch them."" And she went to bed hungry. The next day the same thing happened, and still the hawk kept her word and would not touch them. On the third day she was so hungry that she could scarcely see out of her eyes. Roaming about, the hawk suddenly lighted upon the nest of the crow. Seeing the little, miserable, ugly things in the nest, the hawk at first would not touch them, although she never dreamt that these ugly things were the children of the crow, so much praised by her for their beauty, and thought they must belong to some hideous bird. But what is one to do when one is hungry? One eats what one gets, and not finding anything better, she sat down and gobbled them up one by one, and then flew away. Not long after the hawk had left, the crow came in, feeling sure this time to find her little ones unhurt. But how great was her dismay when she found the nest empty! First she thought the little birds had tried their wings and were flying about in the neighborhood, and she went in search of them. Not finding them, she began to be a little more anxious, and hunting a little more closely, found on the ground near some rushes some tufts of feathers with little bones and blood. She knew at once that the hawk had again been there, feeding on her children. Full of wrath and fury, she went to find the hawk. Meeting her, she said, ""A nice sister and godmother you are! After you had promised most faithfully not to touch my children, no sooner had I turned my back on them, then you come again and eat them."" ""I do not understand what you are saying,"" replied the hawk. ""It is your own fault. You told me your children were the most beautiful in the world, and those which I have eaten were monsters of hideousness. If I had not felt the pinch of hunger so strong, I would not have touched them, not for anything, such ugly things they were! They nearly made me sick."" ""Is that the way you keep your promise?"" replied the angry crow. ""After having eaten them, you even have the impudence to tell lies and insult me. Off with you! And woe betide you if I ever catch you, I will teach you to behave properly."" From that day on, the hawk, if it gets near the crows, attacks them. And from that day on there is implacable hatred between the crows and the hawks.",Romania,"Source (Internet Archive): M.

"Mother Killed Me, Father 
Ate Me",0720,The Crow's Nest,"Availing herself of the girl's absence, the mother killed the poor little boy and hid him in a pot of stewed cabbage. By the time that the girl returned, her dear little brother was half stewed. When the mess was quite done, the woman poured it into a smaller pot, placed the small pot into a sling, and sent the food by her daughter to her husband who was in the field. The man liked the dish very much, and asked the girl, ""What kind of meat is this? It is very nice."" ""I believe, dear father, mother had to kill a small lamb last night, and no doubt she cooked it for you,"" replied the girl. But somehow or other the girl learned the true state of things, and the news nearly broke her heart. She immediately went back to the field, gathered up the bones of her little brother, carefully wrapped them into a beautiful piece of new white linen and took them into the nearest forest, where she hid them in a hollow tree. Nobody can foretell what will happen, and so it came to pass that the bones did not remain very long in the hollow of the tree. Next spring a crow came and hatched them, and they became exactly such a boy as they were before. The boy would sometimes perch on the edge of the hollow, and sing to a beautiful tune the following words: So the boy again commenced to sing: Then a man with a crutch-stick hobbled by. ""Well, my boy,"" he said, ""sing me that song again. I live in a big village, have traveled far, but have never heard such a pretty tune."" And the boy again commenced to sing: The next one to pass was a miller. He also asked the boy to repeat the pretty tune, and as the boy complied with his request the miller presented him with a millstone. Then a sudden thought flashed across the boy's head, and he flew to his father's house, settled on the roof, and commenced to sing: The girl went out and tried to drive away the bird, but instead of flying away the young crow continued to sing the same song, and threw down the cloak to his sister. The girl was much pleased with the present, ran into the house and exclaimed, ""Look here what a nice present that ugly bird has given to me!"" ""Very nice indeed; very nice indeed. I will go out too,"" said her father. So he went out, and the bird threw down to him the crutch-stick. The old man was highly delighted with the gift; he was getting very weak, and the crutch-stick came in useful to him as a support. ""Look here what a strong crutch-stick he has given to me ! It will be a great help to me in my old age."" Then his mother jumped up from behind the oven and said, ""I must go out too; if presents won't shower at least a few might drivel to me."" So she went out and looked up to the roof, and the boy gave her a present for which she had not bargained. He threw the millstone at her, which killed her on the spot. Thus far goes our tale.

"Mother Killed Me, Father 
Ate Me",0720,The Girl and the Boy,"There once lived near a thick forest a woodcutter who had a wicked wife and two good children. Now the woodcutter was very poor and had scarcely enough bread to still his own hunger and that of his family. One day the father had again gone into the woods, and the wicked mother was alone in their small hut. The wicked mother said to the children, ""Go into the forest and collect some wood. The first one of you to return home will get a very beautiful apple."" The girl and the boy went out into the forest to collect wood and hurriedly gathered up two bundles of twigs. Having tied up the bundles, they quickly turned their steps toward home. But as they approached their hut the more uneasy they grew. It was as though they had stones on their hearts. As they were walking along, the boy's shoulder strap broke, and he asked his sister, ""Wait for me. My shoulder strap broke, and I have to tie it together."" But the girl thought about the beautiful apple that their mother had promised, and she hurried onward. She had gone only a little way when her shoulder strap broke as well. Her brother caught up with her, panting under his heavy burden of wood. The girl now asked him, ""Wait for me. My shoulder strap broke, and I have to tie it together."" But the boy had no ears for his sister's request, and he replied, ""You didn't wait for me. Now I'm going to get the apple."" The boy ran and ran, finally arriving at home. Throwing his bundle of wood into the empty kitchen, he asked his mother for the promised apple. ""Go upstairs to the storeroom. The apples are there in the chest. You can get three of them,"" said the mother. They boy was not happy with this answer and told his mother that he wanted her to fetch the apples, as she did other times. The mother finally gave in to the boy's wishes, and they went together to the storeroom and to the chest where the apples were. The boy was overjoyed at the sight of the apples. He clapped his hands, then leaned over into the chest to get his apples. While he was happily looking at them, his mother suddenly slammed the lid shut. The poor boy's head rolled into the chest, and his body lay there on the floor motionless and lifeless. The wicked mother took the corpse and hung it on a nail behind the storeroom door. In the meantime the girl, who had fixed her broken shoulder strap, arrived with her bundle of wood. She unloaded it in the kitchen and asked her mother for an apple. The mother was very friendly, beckoned her nearer, and gave her a red apple. The girl bit into the apple, and the mother went to the hearth to fix a noon meal for the father, who was chopping wood in the forest. ""Go upstairs to the storeroom and fetch me some flour and lard,"" said the mother to the girl. ""But do not look behind the door."" The poor little sister went upstairs to the storeroom, and she did look behind the door, and she saw her poor dead brother hanging there. The girl cried so bitterly that a stone would have felt sorry for her. Tears dripped to the floor. Finally she had to go downstairs to her mother, and crying, she brought her the flour and lard she had asked for. ""Did you look behind the door?"" the wicked mother asked the crying girl. ""Oh no,"" replied the poor child, crying even harder and holding her worn-out blue apron in front of her face. The mother was satisfied with her answer and sent the sobbing girl out into the dark woods with the father's noon meal. Today the girl took no pleasure in the squirrels that were climbing about in the fir trees, nor in the pinecones and wildflowers, but instead went her way quietly crying. She finally came to her father, who quickly reached for the soup, for he was hungry. He was very surprised to see meat in his soup today, because for a long time he had not even seen a little piece of meat, much less had one in his mouth. He sat down beneath a large, beautiful beech tree and began to eat. He took the first piece of meat onto his bone spoon and was about to put it into his mouth when a little bird flew to the tree and began to sing: The woodcutter found this very strange, and the little bird gave him no peace, singing over and over again: The father felt more and more ill at ease, until even the rustling of the leaves frightened him. Then he went home with the poor girl, who was very sad and spoke not a word. Meanwhile the wicked mother had busied herself packing away and hiding the dead boy. However, many, many little birds flattered around her, leaving her no peace and singing in a very sorrowful tone: She wanted to drive away the innocent little creatures, but as she was shooing them away and chasing after them, the heavy storeroom door fell shut and cut off the wicked mother's head. The father arrived at home, and inside everything was quiet and still. Only the birds were singing: The father went upstairs into the storeroom, and opening the door he found his wicked wife and his poor little son, both lying dead on the floor.",Austria,"Source: Ignaz and Joseph Zingerle, ""Mädchen und Bübchen"" Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Innsbruck: Verlag der Wagner'schen Buchhandlung, 1852), no. 12, pp. 64-68.",NA,Translated by D.

"Mother Killed Me, Father 
Ate Me",0720,The Juniper Tree,"Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly. However, they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but they didn't get any, and they didn't get any. In front of their house there was a courtyard where there stood a juniper tree. One day in winter the woman was standing beneath it, peeling herself an apple, and while she was thus peeling the apple, she cut her finger, and the blood fell into the snow. ""Oh,"" said the woman. She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. ""If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow."" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen. Then she went into the house, and a month went by, and the snow was gone. And two months, and everything was green. And three months, and all the flowers came out of the earth. And four months, and all the trees in the woods grew thicker, and the green branches were all entwined in one another, and the birds sang until the woods resounded and the blossoms fell from the trees. Then the fifth month passed, and she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful. Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, ""If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree."" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died. Her husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it. And some time later he took another wife. He had a daughter by the second wife, but the first wife's child was a little son, and he was as red as blood and as white as snow. When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter. And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace. One day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, ""Mother, give me an apple."" ""Yes, my child,"" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock. ""Mother,"" said the little daughter, ""is brother not to have one too?"" This made the woman angry, but she said, ""Yes, when he comes home from school."" When from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, ""You shall not have one before your brother."" She threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, ""My son, do you want an apple?"" And she looked at him fiercely. ""Mother,"" said the little boy, ""how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple."" Then it seemed to her as if she had to persuade him. ""Come with me,"" she said, opening the lid of the chest. ""Take out an apple for yourself."" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples. Then fear overcame her, and she thought, ""Maybe I can get out of this."" So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen. Then she set him on a chair in front of the door and put the apple in his hand. After this Marlene came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pot of hot water before her which she was stirring around and around. ""Mother,"" said Marlene, ""brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened."" ""Go back to him,"" said her mother, ""and if he will not answer you, then box his ears."" So Marlene went to him and said, ""Brother, give me the apple."" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, ""Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,"" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted. ""Marlene,"" said the mother, ""what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew."" Then the mother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pot, and cooked him into stew. But Marlene stood by crying and crying, and all her tears fell into the pot, and they did not need any salt. Then the father came home, and sat down at the table and said, ""Where is my son?"" And the mother served up a large, large dish of stew, and Marlene cried and could not stop. Then the father said again, ""Where is my son?"" ""Oh,"" said the mother, ""he has gone across the country to his mother's great uncle. He will stay there awhile."" ""What is he doing there? He did not even say good-bye to me."" ""Oh, he wanted to go, and asked me if he could stay six weeks. He will be well taken care of there."" ""Oh,"" said the man, ""I am unhappy. It isn't right. He should have said good-bye to me."" With that he began to eat, saying, ""Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back."" Then he said, ""Wife, this food is delicious. Give me some more."" And the more he ate the more he wanted, and he said, ""Give me some more. You two shall have none of it. It seems to me as if it were all mine."" And he ate and ate, throwing all the bones under the table, until he had finished it all. Marlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood. She laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore. Then the juniper tree began to move. The branches moved apart, then moved together again, just as if someone were rejoicing and clapping his hands. At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there. Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate. Then the bird flew away and lit on a goldsmith's house, and began to sing: The goldsmith was sitting in his workshop making a golden chain, when he heard the bird sitting on his roof and singing. The song seemed very beautiful to him. He stood up, but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. However, he went right up the middle of the street with only one slipper and one sock on. He had his leather apron on, and in one hand he had a golden chain and in the other his tongs. The sun was shining brightly on the street. He walked onward, then stood still and said to the bird, ""Bird,"" he said, ""how beautifully you can sing. Sing that piece again for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the golden chain, and then I will sing it again for you."" The goldsmith said, ""Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me."" Then the bird came and took the golden chain in his right claw, and went and sat in front of the goldsmith, and sang: Then the bird flew away to a shoemaker, and lit on his roof and sang: Hearing this, the shoemaker ran out of doors in his shirtsleeves, and looked up at his roof, and had to hold his hand in front of his eyes to keep the sun from blinding him. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you can sing."" Then he called in at his door, ""Wife, come outside. There is a bird here. Look at this bird. He certainly can sing."" Then he called his daughter and her children, and the journeyman, and the apprentice, and the maid, and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head. ""Bird,"" said the shoemaker, ""now sing that song again for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. You must give me something."" ""Wife,"" said the man, ""go into the shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down."" Then the wife went and brought the shoes. ""There, bird,"" said the man, ""now sing that piece again for me."" Then the bird came and took the shoes in his left claw, and flew back to the roof, and sang: When he had finished his song he flew away. In his right claw he had the chain and in his left one the shoes. He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. Then the bird went and sat on a linden tree which stood in front of the mill, and sang: Then one of them stopped working. Then two more stopped working and listened, Then four more stopped, Now only eight only were chiseling, Now only five, Now only one, Then the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. ""Bird,"" said he, ""how beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me."" ""No,"" said the bird, ""I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the millstone, and then I will sing it again."" ""Yes,"" he said, ""if it belonged only to me, you should have it."" ""Yes,"" said the others, ""if he sings again he can have it."" Then the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! The bird stuck his neck through the hole and put the stone on as if it were a collar, then flew to the tree again, and sang: When he was finished singing, he spread his wings, and in his right claw he had the chain, and in his left one the shoes, and around his neck the millstone. He flew far away to his father's house. In the room the father, the mother, and Marlene were sitting at the table. The father said, ""I feel so contented. I am so happy."" ""Not I,"" said the mother, ""I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming."" But Marlene just sat and cried and cried. Then the bird flew up, and as it seated itself on the roof, the father said, ""Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again."" ""Not I,"" said the woman, ""I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins."" And she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through. Then the bird seated itself on the juniper tree, and sang: The mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning. ""Oh, mother,"" said the man, ""that is a beautiful bird. He is singing so splendidly, and the sun is shining so warmly, and it smells like pure cinnamon."" Then Marlene laid her head on her knees and cried and cried, but the man said, ""I am going out. I must see the bird up close."" ""Oh, don't go,"" said the woman, ""I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire."" But the man went out and looked at the bird. With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, ""Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks."" But the woman was terrified. She fell down on the floor in the room, and her cap fell off her head. Then the bird sang once more: ""I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!"" Then the woman fell down as if she were dead. ""Oh,"" said Marlene, ""I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something."" Then she went out. He threw the shoes down to her. Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. ""Oh,"" she said, ""I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes."" ""No,"" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, ""I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better."" And as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death. The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.",Germany,"Source: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Von dem Machandelboom, Kinder- und Hausmärchen (Children's and Household Tales -- Grimms' Fairy Tales), no. 47.","The Grimms' source for this tale, recorded in wonderfully simple, but poetic Low German, was the romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge (1777-1810).

"Mother Killed Me, Father 
Ate Me",0720,The Little Boy and the Wicked Stepmother,"Once upon a time there was a poor man, who had a wife and two children, a boy and a girl. He was so poor that he possessed nothing in the world but the ashes on his hearth. His wife died, and after a time he married another woman, who was cantankerous and bad natured, and from morning till evening, as long as the day lasted, she gave the poor man no peace, but snarled and shouted at him. The woman said to him, ""Do away with these children. You cannot even keep me. How then can you keep all these mouths?"" for was she not a stepmother? The poor man stood her nagging for a long time, but then, one night, she quarreled so much that he promised her that he would take the children into the forest and leave them there. The two children were sitting in the corner but held their peace and heard all that was going on. The next day, the man, taking his ax upon his shoulder, called to the children and said to them, ""Come with me into the forest. I am going to cut wood."" The little children went with him, but before they left, the little girl filled her pocket with ashes from the hearth, and as she walked along she dropped little bits of coal the way they went. After a time they reached a very dense part of the forest, where they could not see their way any longer, and there the man said to the children, ""Wait here for a while. I am only going to cut wood yonder. When I have done I will come back and fetch you home."" And leaving the children there in the thicket, he went away, heavy hearted, and returned home. The children waited for a while, and seeing that their father did not return, the girl knew what he had done. So they slept through the night in the forest, and the next morning, taking her brother by the hand, she followed the trace of the ashes which she had left on the road, and thus came home to their own house. When the stepmother saw them, she did not know what to do with herself. She went almost out of her mind with fury. If she could, she would have swallowed them in a spoonful of water, so furious was she. The husband, who was a weakling, tried to pacify her, and to endeavor to get the children away by one means or another, but did not succeed. When the stepmother found that she could not do anything through her husband, she made up her mind that she herself would get rid of them. So one morning, when her husband had gone away, she took the little boy, and without saying anything to anybody, she killed him and gave him to his sister to cut him up, and prepare a meal for all of them. What was she to do? If she was not to be killed like her brother, she had to do what her stepmother told her. And so she cut him up and cooked him ready for the meal But she took the heart, and hid it away in a hollow of a tree. When the stepmother asked her where the heart was, she said that a dog had come and taken it away. In the evening, when the husband came home, she brought the broth with the meat for the husband to eat, and she sat down and ate of it, and so did the husband, not knowing that he was eating the flesh of his child. The little girl refused to eat it. She would not touch it. After they had finished, she gathered up all the little bones and hid them in the hollow of the tree where she had put the heart. The next morning, out of that hollow of the tree there came a little bird with dark feathers, and sitting on the branch of a tree, began to sing, ""Cuckoo! My sister has cooked me, and my father has eaten me, but I am now a cuckoo and safe from my stepmother."" When the stepmother, who happened to be near the tree, heard what that little bird was singing, in her fury and fright she took a heavy lump of salt which lay near at hand, and threw it at the cuckoo. But instead of hitting it, the lump fell down on her head and killed her on the spot. And the little boy has remained a cuckoo to this very day.

"Mother Killed Me, Father

One day he caught a hare, and took it home to his wife, and asked her to make it ready for his dinner. While it was on the fire the goodwife tasted and tasted at it, till she had tasted it all away, and she did not know what to do for her goodman's dinner. So she called her son Johnny to come in and get his head combed, and when she was combing his head, she killed him and put him into the pot. Well, the goodman came home to his dinner, and his wife set down Johnny, well boiled, in front of him. And when he was eating, he took up a foot and said, ""That's surely my Johnny's foot.""

""Child,"" said the stepmother one day, ""go to the grocer's shop and buy me a pound of candles."" She gave her the money, and the little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her return. There was a stile to cross. She put down the candles while she got over the stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles. She went back to the grocer's, and she got a second bunch. She came to the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up came the dog and ran off with the candles. She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch, and just the same event happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent all the money and had lost three bunches of candles. The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss. She said to the child, ""Come, lay your head on my lap that I may comb your hair."" So the little one laid her head in the woman's lap, who proceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed, the hair fell over her knees and rolled right down to the ground. Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair, so she said to her, ""I cannot part your hair on my knee. Fetch a billet of wood."" So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, ""I cannot part your hair with a comb. Fetch me an ax."" So she fetched it. ""Now,"" said the wicked woman, ""Lay your head down on the billet while I part your hair."" Well! She laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist! down came the ax, and it was off. So the mother wiped the ax and laughed. Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed them and brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted them and shook his head. He said they tasted very strangely. She gave some to the little boy, but he would not eat. She tried to force him, but he refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up his little sister, and put her in a box, and buried the box under a rose tree; and every day he went to the tree and wept, till his tears ran down on the box. One day the rose tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the flowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an angel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler's shop, and perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang: ""Sing again that beautiful song,"" asked the shoemaker. ""If you will first give me those little red shoes you are making."" The cobbler gave the shoes, and the bird sang the song, then flew to a tree in front of a watchmaker's and sang: ""Oh, the beautiful song! Sing it again, sweet bird,"" asked the watchmaker. ""If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in your hand."" The jeweler gave the watch and chain. The bird took it in one foot, the shoes in the other, and flew away, after having repeated the song, to where three millers were picking a millstone. The bird perched on a tree and sang: Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work, Then the second miller's man laid aside his tool and looked up, Then the third miller's man laid down his tool and looked up, Then all three cried out with one voice, ""Oh, what a beautiful song! Sing it sweet bird, again."" ""If you will put the millstone round my neck,"" said the bird. The men complied with the bird's request, and away to the tree it flew with the millstone round his neck, the red shoes in the grasp of one foot, and the gold watch and chain in the grasp of the other. He sang the song and then flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house, and the stepmother said, ""It thunders."" Then the little boy ran out to see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and the stepmother said again, ""It thunders."" Then the father ran out, and down fell the chain about his neck. In ran father and son, laughing and saying, ""See, the thunder has brought us these fine things!"" Then the bird rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house a third time, and the stepmother said, ""It thunders again. Perhaps the thunder has brought something for me,"" and she ran out. But the moment she stepped outside the door, down fell the millstone on her head. And so she died.",England (Devonshire),"Source: S.

The Iron-Eating Mice,1592,Miracle upon Miracle,"In his house there was a large set of heavy iron scales that had been acquired by his ancestors. He gave these to the guild-master Nanduka for safekeeping, and set forth for foreign lands. After he had pursued his desires for a long time abroad, he returned to his homeland, and said to the guild-master Nanduka, ""Guild-master, give me back the scales that I left here for safekeeping."" Nanduka replied, ""Oh, your scales are no longer here. The mice ate them up."" When he heard this, Lakschmana said, ""Well, Nanduka, if the mice ate them up, then it is through no fault of yours. That is the way of the world. Nothing in it is eternal. But now I would like to bathe myself in the river. Send your child with me, the boy named Dhanadeva, to carry my bathing things."" Nanduka, fearing Lakschama because of the theft he had committed against him, said to his son, ""Child, your uncle Lakschmana wants to take a bath in the river. Go with him and carry his bathing things."" Yes, with truth they say: No one does a favor for another, unless driven by fear, greed, or some other purpose. And further: If someone shows you unusual courtesy, be cautious, lest it lead to a bad end. Nanduka's son, carrying the bathing things, set forth happily with Lakschmana. After taking his bath, Lakschmana threw Nanduka's son Dhanadeva into a cave on the bank of the river, and sealed the opening with a large stone. Then he rushed back to Nanduka's house. The merchant asked him, ""Speak up, Lakschmana! Tell me, where is my child who went to the river with you?"" Lakschmana said, ""He was taken away from the river's bank by a falcon."" The merchant cried, ""You liar! How in the world can a falcon steal a boy? Give me back my son, or I will bring action against you at the king's court."" Lakschmana said, ""Oh, you who always speak the truth! A falcon can carry away a boy, if mice can eat a large set of heavy iron scales. If you want your son back, then give me my scales!"" Thus quarreling one with another, they went to the king's gate, where Nanduka cried out loudly, ""A dastardly crime has happened here! This thief has robbed me of my child!"" Hearing this, the judges said to Lakschmana, ""Return the guild-master's son to him!"" Lakschmana answered, ""What can I do? Before my very eyes a falcon carried him away from the bank of the river."" Hearing this, they said, ""You do not tell the truth. How could a falcon be capable of carrying off a fifteen-year-old boy?"" Lakschmana answered, laughing, ""Ha! Listen to this proverb: When mice can eat a thousand pounds of iron, then a falcon can carry away an elephant, to say nothing of a little boy."" The judges said, ""What do you mean by that?"" Then Lakschmana told the whole story about the scales. After hearing this, they laughed at what Nanduka and Lakschmana had done, reconciled the two with each other, and made them respectively return the scales and the boy.",India,"Source: The Panchatantra, book 1, story 21.","I have used the following edition: Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen.

The Iron-Eating Mice,1592,The Iron Weights and Scales Which Were Eaten by Mice,"As it has been said ""A rich man is wise; a rich man is generous; a rich man is the incarnation of virtue; a rich man is thought much of, and has no end of friends. But if his money go, everything else goes with it."" So this Bhudhara having lost everything that he possessed except some weights and scales, went away to another country, leaving the relics of this property in the care of a friend, who was also a merchant. After a time he made another fortune and returned to his own country. The first thing he did was to go to his friend and ask for the weights and scales. The merchant did not want to give them up, and after some demur he said: ""Really I am very sorry, but they have been eaten by the mice."" Bhudhara said nothing but bided his time, and one day soon after this he was walking by the merchant's house, and saw his boy playing outside. Bhudhara promptly kidnapped the boy. The merchant was in a terrible state at the loss of his son, and started off with his whole family to try and find him. One of the neighbors met the party, who were full of weeping and lamentations, and said (hearing the cause of all this grief): ""Oh! I know where the boy is; I saw him with Bhudhara."" So they went to Bhudhara's house, and the father asked Bhudhara to give him up his son. ""My dear friend,"" replied Bhudhara, ""I am really very sorry, but I cannot! Your boy was with me, we were walking along the bank of the river, when an eagle came and carried him off."" On this the father grew very angry and had Bhudhara up before the magistrates, on the charge of having made away with his son. Bhudhara appeared to answer the charge, and when the judge asked him what he had to say, he replied: ""My lord! in a place where the mice can eat up weights and scales of iron, an eagle might easily carry off an elephant -- much more a boy."" The magistrate who heard the case decided that when the merchant returned the weights and scales his boy should be restored to him, and so the end of it was that Bhudhara got back his weights and scales, and the merchant, though he recovered his boy, was punished for the theft.",India,"Source: The Enchanted Parrot: Being a Selection from the ""Suka Saptati,"" or, The Seventy Tales of Parrot.

He repeated, ""It is quite true, the iron, of which it was composed, was particularly sweet, and so the mice ate it."" This he said with an outward show of sorrow, laughing in his heart. Then the merchant's son asked him to give him some food, and he, being in a good temper, consented to give him some. Then the merchant's son went to bathe, taking with him the son of that merchant, who was a mere child, and whom he persuaded to come with him by giving him a dish of ámalakas. And after he had bathed, the wise merchant's son deposited the boy in the house of a friend, and returned alone to the house of that merchant. And the merchant said to him, ""Where is that son of mine?"" He replied, ""A kite swooped down from the air and carried him off.""

The officers of the court said, "" This is impossible, how could a kite carry off a boy?"" But the merchant's son answered, "" In a country where a large balance of iron was eaten by mice, a kite might carry off an elephant, much more a boy.""

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,A Bridegroom for Miss Mole,"Down under the earth, near this mighty colossus, lived a soft-furred mole and his wife. One day a daughter was born to them. It was the most wonderful mole baby that ever was known. The father was so proud of his lovely offspring that he determined to marry her only to the grandest thing in the whole universe. Nothing else would satisfy his pride in the beautiful creature he called his own. Father Mole sought long and hard to find out where and what, in all nature, was considered the most wonderful. He called in his neighbors and talked over the matter with them. Then he visited the king of the moles and asked the wise ones in his court to decide for him. One and all agreed that the Great Blue Sky was above everything else in glory and greatness. So up to the Sky the Mole Father went and offered his daughter to be the bride of the Great Blue, telling how, with his vast azure robe, the Sky had the reputation, both on the earth and under it, of being the greatest thing in the universe. But, much to the Mole Father's surprise, the Sky declined. ""No, I am not the greatest. I must refer you to the Sun. He controls me, for he can make it day or night as he pleases. Only when he rises, can I wear my bright colors. When he goes down, darkness covers the world, and men do not see me at all, but the stars instead. Better take your charming daughter to him."" So to the Sun went Mr. Mole and though afraid to look directly into his face, he made his plea. He would have the Sun marry his attractive daughter. But the mighty luminary, that usually seemed so fierce, dazzling men's eyesight and able to burn up the very grass of the field, seemed suddenly very modest. Instead of accepting at once the offer, the Sun said to the father, ""Alas! I am not master. The Cloud is greater than I, for he is able to cover me up and make me invisible for days and weeks. I am not as powerful as you think me to be. Let me advise you to offer your daughter to the Cloud."" Surprised at this, the Mole Father looked quite disappointed. Now he was in doubt as to what time he had best propose to the Cloud, -- when it was silvery white and glistening in a summer afternoon, or when it was black and threatening a tempest. However, his ambition to get for his daughter the mightiest possible bridegroom prompted him to wait until the lightnings flashed and the thunder rolled. Then, appearing before the terrible dark Cloud that shot out fire, he told of the charms of his wonderful daughter and offered her as bride. ""And why do you come to me?"" asked the Cloud, its face inky black with the wrath of a storm and its eyes red with the fires of lightning. ""Because you are not only the greatest thing in the universe, but you have proved it by your terrible power,"" replied the Father Mole. At this the Cloud ceased its rolling, stopped its fire and thunder and almost laughed. ""So far from being the greatest thing in the world, I am not even my own master. See already how the Wind is driving me. Soon I shall be invisible, dissolved in air. Let me commend you to the Wind. The Master of the Cloud will make a grand son-in-law."" Thereupon Papa Mole waited until the Wind calmed down, after blowing away the clouds. Then telling of his daughter's accomplishments and loveliness, he made proffer of his only child as bride to the Wind. But the Wind was not half so proud as the Mole Father had expected to find him. Very modest, almost bashful seemed the Wind, as he confessed that before Miryek, the colossal stone image, his power was naught. ""Why, I smite that Great Stone Face and its eyes do not even blink. I roar in his ears, but he minds it not. I try to make him sneeze, but he will not. Smite him as I may, he still stands unmoved and smiling. Alas, no. I am not the grandest thing in the universe, while Miryek stands. Go to him. He alone is worthy to marry your daughter."" By this time the Mole Father was not only footsore and weary, but much discouraged also. Evidently all appreciated his shining daughter; but would he be able, after all, to get her a worthy husband? He rested himself a while and then proceeded to Miryek, the colossus of granite as large as a lighthouse, its head far up in the air, but with ears ready to hear. The Mole Father squeaked out compliments to the image as being by common confession the greatest thing on earth. He presented his request for a son-in-law and then in detail mentioned the accomplishments of his daughter, sounding her praises at great length. Indeed, he almost ruined his case by talking so long. With stony patience, Miryek listened to the proud father with a twinkle in his white granite eyes. When his lips moved, he was heard to say, ""Fond Parent, what you say is true. I am great. I care not for the sky day or night, for I remain the same in daylight and darkness. I fear not the sun, that cannot melt me, nor the frost that is not able to make me crumble. Cold or hot, in summer or in winter time, I remain unchanged. The clouds come and go, but they cannot move me. Their fire and noise, lightning and thunder, I fear not. Yes, I am great."" Then the stone lips closed again. ""You will make, then, a good bridegroom for my daughter? You will marry her, I understand?"" asked the proud father as his hopes began to rise, though he was still doubtful. ""I would gladly do so, if I were greatest. But I am not,"" said Miryek. ""Down under my feet is the Mole. He digs with his shovel-like hands and makes burrows day and night. His might I cannot resist. Soon he shall undermine my base and I shall topple down and lie like common stone along the earth. Yes I by universal confession, the Mole is the greatest thing in the universe and to him I yield. Better marry your daughter to him."" So after all his journeying, the lovely daughter's father sought no further. Advised on all sides, and opinion being unanimous, he found out that the Mole was the greatest thing in the universe. His daughter's bridegroom was found at home and of the same family of creatures. He married her to a young and handsome Mole, and great was the joy and rejoicing at the wedding. The pair were well-mated and lived happily ever afterward.",Korea,"Source: William Elliot Griffis, The Unmannerly Tiger and Other Korean Tales (New York: Thomas Y.

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,A Story on Caste,"""O Chando, we understand that you are the greatest being in the world and we have come to marry our daughter to you."" Chando answered, ""I fancy there is some one greater than I."" ""Who is he?"" asked the parents. ""The cloud is greater than I, for it can hide my face and quench my rays."" At this the father and mother hurried off with their daughter in search of the cloud, and when they found him, told him that they had brought their daughter to give him to wife, as he was the greatest being in the world. ""I may be great,"" said the cloud, ""but there is a greater than I, the wind. The wind rises and blows me away in a minute."" So they went in search of the wind and when they found him, explained to him why they had brought him their daughter. The wind said, ""I am strong but there are stronger than I. The mountains are stronger. I can blow things down or whirl them away, but I cannot move the mountains."" So on they went to the mountain and explained their errand. The mountain said, ""I am great but there are more powerful than I. The ground-rat is more powerful, for however high I may be the ground-rats burrow holes in me and I cannot resist them."" The poor parents by this time began to feel rather discouraged, but still they made up their minds to persevere and went on to look for the ground-rat. They found him and offered him their daughter in marriage, but the ground-rat denied that he was the most powerful being on earth. The Musahars were more powerful for they lived by digging out ground-rats and eating them. The hapless couple went home very dejectedly, reflecting that they had begun by despising their own caste and had gone in search of something greater and had ended where they began. So they arranged to marry their daughter to a man of their own caste after all. Moral. You should not despise your own caste or race; you cannot help what caste you are born into. A Santal may learn to read and write and associate with men of good position and thereby his mind may be perverted. He may wish to change his caste and become a Sadhu, or a Kherwar, or a Boistab, or a Mussulman, or a Christian or anything else; but people will still know him for a beef-eating Santal. If he becomes a Christian, no one will think him the equal of a Saheb or a Brahman; no Saheb will marry his daughter or give him his daughter in marriage. Remember what happened to the Musahar, who despised his own caste. God caused you to be born in a certain caste. He and not we made the different castes, and He knows what is good and bad for us.",India,"Source: Cecil Henry Bompas, Folklore of the Santal Parganas (London: David Nutt, 1909), no. 51, pp. 168-70.",NA,NA

When she had come to the age of womanhood, the monk said to her, ""My dear daughter, you are quite grown up, and you absolutely must have a husband; choose then, one to suit yourself, so that I may unite you to him."" ""Since you leave me free to choose,"" she replied, ""I wish for my husband, he who is the most powerful in the world."" ""Perhaps you would like the sun?"" said he; and he went to find the sun, and said to it, ""O! thou who art so essentially great, I have a daughter who desires to have for a husband he who is the most powerful in the world; would you be willing to marry her?"" ""I will show you someone who is more powerful than I,"" said the sun. ""It is the cloud which obscures me, and makes my rays pale and tarnishes the splendor of my fires.""

Go find the wind which makes me come and go, which drives me from east to west."" The monk went to find the wind, and said to him the same things which he had said to the cloud; but the wind said to him also, ""I will show you someone more powerful than I. It is the mountain that I cannot move."" Then the monk went to speak to the mountain, which made him this reply, ""I will show you someone more powerful than I. It is the rat, against which I cannot defend myself, when he bores into me and makes his home in me."" At last the monk went and said to the rat, ""Do you wish to marry my young daughter?"" ""And how could I do so?"" cried the rat. ""My hole is narrow, and a rat only marries a mouse.""

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Mouse Metamorphosed into a Maid,"The mouse, indeed, was sadly bruised. Although, as neighbors, we are used To be more kind to many others, The Brahmins treat the mice as brothers. The notion haunts their heads, that when The soul goes forth from dying men, It enters worm, or bird, or beast, As Providence or Fate is pleased; And on this mystery rests their law, Which from Pythagoras they're said to draw. And hence the Brahmin kindly pray'd To one who knew the wizard's trade, To give the creature, wounded sore, The form in which it lodged before. Forthwith the mouse became a maid, Of years about fifteen; A lovelier was never seen. She would have waked, I ween, In Priam's son, a fiercer flame Than did the beauteous Grecian dame. Surprised at such a novelty, The Brahmin to the damsel cried, ""Your choice is free; For every he Will seek you for his bride."" Said she, ""Am I to have a voice? The strongest, then, shall be my choice."" ""O sun!"" the Brahmin cried, ""this maid is thine, And thou shalt be a son-in-law of mine."" ""No,"" said the sun, ""this murky cloud, it seems, In strength exceeds me, since he hides my beams; And him I counsel you to take."" Again the reverend Brahmin spake -- ""O cloud, on-flying with thy stores of water, Pray wast thou born to wed my daughter?"" ""Ah, no, alas! for, you may see, The wind is far too strong for me. My claims with Boreas' to compare, I must confess, I do not dare."" ""O wind,"" then cried the Brahmin, vex'd, And wondering what would hinder next, -- ""Approach, and, with thy sweetest air, Embrace -- possess -- the fairest fair."" The wind, enraptured, thither blew; -- A mountain stopp'd him as he flew, To him now pass'd the tennis-ball, And from him to a creature small. Said he, ""I'd wed the maid, but that I've had a quarrel with the rat. A fool were I to take the bride From one so sure to pierce my side."" The rat! It thrill'd the damsel's ear; The name at once seem'd sweet and dear. The rat! 'Twas one of Cupid's blows; The like full many a maiden knows; But all of this beneath the rose. One smacketh ever of the place Where first he show'd the world his face. Thus far the fable's clear as light; But, if we take a nearer sight, There lurks within its drapery Somewhat of graceless sophistry; For who, that worships e'en the glorious sun, Would not prefer to wed some cooler one? And doth a flea's exceed a giant's might, Because the former can the latter bite? And, by the rule of strength, the rat Had sent his bride to wed the cat; From cat to dog, and onward still To wolf or tiger, if you will: Indeed, the fabulist might run A circle backward to the sun. -- But to the change the tale supposes, -- In learned phrase, metempsychosis. The very thing the wizard did Its falsity exposes -- If that indeed were ever hid. According to the Brahmin's plan, The proud aspiring soul of man, And souls that dwell in humbler forms Of rats and mice, and even worms, All issue from a common source, And, hence, they are the same of course. -- Unequal but by accident Of organ and of tenement, They use one pair of legs, or two, Or e'en with none contrive to do, As tyrant matter binds them to. Why, then, could not so fine a frame Constrain its heavenly guest To wed the solar flame? A rat her love possess'd. In all respects, compared and weigh'd, The souls of men and souls of mice Quite different are made, -- Unlike in sort as well as size. Each fits and fills its destined part As Heaven doth well provide; Nor witch, nor fiend, nor magic art, Can set their laws aside.",Jean de La Fontaine,"Source: Jean de La Fontaine, The Fables of Fontaine, translated from the French by Elizur Wright; a new edition with notes by J.

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Rats and Their Daughter,"Once near a lonely farmhouse surrounded by rice fields there lived a rat couple. They were highly regarded by their own kind and very prosperous. One day, in addition to their many other children, a little daughter was born to them. She was so dainty with her shiny gray fur, her broad little upright ears, and her glistening eyes, that her parents became quite proud of their little daughter. Day in and day out their only thoughts were how they might prepare a magnificent future for her. When the little rat came of age, both parents came to the conclusion that only the most powerful being in the entire world should be her husband. Once they were discussing this matter with a neighbor, and he said, ""If you want to give your daughter in marriage to the most powerful being, you must choose the sun as your son-in-law, for without question, no one equals the sun in power. The rat couple saw that this was true, and without hesitation they made their way to the sun and presented to him their proposal that he should marry their daughter. The sun replied, ""I am much indebted to you that you have come so far, and that you have the kind intention to give me your daughter in marriage, but please tell me just why you have chosen me to be your son-in-law."" The rats said, ""We would like to give our daughter in marriage to the most powerful being in the world, and without dispute you are that one. Therefore we have chosen you to be our son-in-law."" Then the sun said, ""What you say is not without foundation, but there is a being more powerful than I, and it is he to whom you must give your daughter."" The rats replied, ""Can there in truth be someone more powerful than you?"" The sun said, ""When I want to shine on the earth, a cloud often comes by and covers me up, and my rays are unable either to penetrate it or to frighten it away. I am powerless against the cloud. Thus you must go to the cloud and make him your son-in-law."" The rats saw that it was so, and they went to the cloud. After they had presented their proposal to him, the cloud said, ""You are in error if you think that I am the most powerful being. I do indeed have the power to cover the sun, but I am powerless against the wind. When he begins to blow, he drives me away and tears me to pieces. There is nothing I can do against him."" So the rats went to the wind and made the proposal to him that he should marry their daughter, whom they wanted to give in marriage to the most powerful being. But the wind said, ""You are in error. I do indeed have the power to drive away the cloud, but I am powerless against the wall that people build to hold me back. I can neither blow through it nor do anything to it. The wall is much more powerful than I."" So the rats again set forth and came to the wall, to whom, in a similar manner, they made their request. The wall replied, ""It is indeed true that I have the power to resist the wind, but there is a rat that is undermining me, boring into me and making holes throughout me, and there is nothing I can do to stop him. I am powerless against the rat. It would be better for you to take the rat for your son-in-law than to choose me!"" This pleased the rats, for they saw that the wall was right. They returned home and married their dear daughter to a handsome young rat. They never regretted this, for their daughter lived happily and contentedly with a man of her own kind. And the parents, who once had wanted to elevate her so high, shared in her happiness and satisfaction.",Japan,"Source: David Brauns, ""Die Ratten und ihr Töchterlein,"" Japanische Märchen und Sagen (Leipzig: Verlag von Wilhelm Friedrich, 1885), pp. 85-87.",Link to additional Folktales from Japan.,Translated from the German by D.

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Story of the Rat and Her Journey to God,"In a mill a rat once lived and prospered. It took after the miller, and from day to day its paunch grew bigger. It became as round as a cucumber and as fat as a candle. One day, looking at its round, sleek figure, the rat said to itself, ""Behold I am so beautiful and strong. Why should I not go and pay a visit to God? He is sure to receive me."" No sooner said than done. Leaving the mill, he started on his journey to God. After traveling a few days and not coming nearer to God, he stopped and said, ""Methinks that either God lives much farther away than I believed, or I have lost my way. I will go to the sun and ask where God is."" Coming to the sun, the rat asked, ""Where is God?"" ""Off with you,"" shouted the sun. ""I have no time for idle talkers."" The rat went to the clouds and asked them, ""Where is God?"" ""We cannot stop to bandy words with the like of you."" Away the rat went and came to the wind. ""Where is God?"" asked the rat. ""There,"" replied the wind, whistling, and getting hold of the rat hurled him down onto an ant-heap, and there he found his level.",Romania,NA,"Source: M.

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Transformed Mouse Seeks a Bridegroom,"On the shore of the Ganges there was a hermitage filled with holy men dedicated to prayer, self denial, repentance, the study of holy scriptures, fasting, and meditation. They drank only small amounts of very pure water, and mortified their bodies with a diet of bulbs, roots, fruits, and water plants. Their only clothing were loincloths made from tree bark. The father of the hermitage was named Yajnavalkya. He had just finished bathing in the Ganges and was about to rinse out his mouth when a little mouse fell from a falcon's beak into his hand. After looking at it, he set it onto a fig leaf, bathed himself once more, rinsed out his mouth, and performed his penitential and other rituals. Then through the power of his holiness he transformed the mouse into a girl. Taking her home with him to his hermitage, he said to his wife, who was childless, ""My dear, take her in place of a daughter. Bring her up with care!"" Thereafter she was reared, loved, and nurtured. When she was twelve years old, and the wife saw that she was ready for marriage, she said to her husband, ""Listen, husband, do you not see that it is past time for our daughter's marriage?"" He said, ""What you say is quite right! So if she is willing, I will summon the exalted sun god and present her to him as a wife. His wife said, ""What could be said against that? Do it!"" Through the power of prayer and incantations the sun appeared without delay, saying, ""Holy man, why do you summon me?"" The man answered, ""Behold! Here stands my little daughter. If she will have you, take her as a wife!"" Having said this, he said to his daughter, ""Daughter, does this exalted one please you, this sun god who illuminates the three worlds?"" The daughter said, ""Father, he is too hot. I do not want him. Summon a better one!"" Hearing this, the wise man said to the sun, ""Exalted one, is there a being more powerful than you?"" The sun answered, ""Yes, there is a stronger one than I. The cloud, through whose cover I become invisible."" Then the wise man summoned the cloud and said to his daughter, ""Daughter, shall I give you to this one as a wife?"" She answered, ""He is black and cold. Therefore give me to another powerful being!"" Upon this the wise man asked the cloud, ""Listen, cloud! Is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The cloud answered, ""The wind is more powerful than I! Driven by the wind, I am scattered into a thousand pieces."" After hearing this, the wise man summoned the wind and said, ""Daughter, does the wind please you most of all as a husband?"" She answered, ""Father! He is entirely too inconstant. Summon a more powerful one instead!"" The wise man said, ""Wind, is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The wind said, ""The mountain is more powerful than I, for however strong I am, he still stands firmly against me."" Then the wise man summoned the mountain and said to the girl, ""Daughter, shall I give you to this one in marriage?"" She answered, ""Father, he is hard and rigid. Therefore give me to another one."" The wise man asked the mountain, ""Listen, king of the mountains, is there anyone more powerful than you?"" The mountain answered, ""The mice are more powerful than I, for they make holes in my body with violence."" With that the wise man summoned a mouse and showed him to her, saying, ""Daughter, shall I give you to him as a wife? Does this mouse king please you?"" Seeing him, she thought, ""He is of my own kind."" Her hair stood on end with pleasure, making her even more beautiful, and she said, ""Father, make me into a mouse and give me to him as a wife so I can fulfill the domestic duties prescribed for my kind!"" Through the power of his holiness he transformed her into a little mouse and gave her to the other mouse as a wife. One of India's most influential contributions to world literature, The Panchatantra (also spelled Pañcatantra or Pañca-tantra) consists of five books of animal fables and magic tales (some 87 stories in all) that were compiled in their current form between the third and fifth centuries AD. It is believed that even then the stories were already ancient. The tales' self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty. Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic translation from about 750 AD attributes The Panchatantra to a wise man called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning ""court scholar."" The fables of The Panchatantra found their way to Europe through oral folklore channels and by way of Persian and Arabic translations. They substantially influenced medieval writers of fables.",India (The Panchatantra),"Source: The Panchatantra, book 3.","I have used the following edition: ""Die verwandelte Maus soll sich einen Bräutigam wählen,"" Pantschatantra: Fünf Bücher indischer Fabeln, Märchen und Erzählungen, aus dem Sanskrit übersetzt mit Einleitung und Anmerkungen von Theodor Benfey, vol. 2 (Leipzig: F.

The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun,2031c,The Vole Who Sought a Wife,"The sun replied, ""But there is one even mightier than I: the cloud, for he is able to cover my brightness entirely."" So the vole went to the cloud, addressed him as ""the mightiest one,"" and asked to wed his daughter. The cloud responded that the vole would find an even stronger being in the wind, who had the power to push the cloud away at will. Next the vole journeyed to the wind, explaining that he understood him to be the most powerful creature of all, and wishing therefore to marry his daughter. ""You are mistaken,"" answered the wind. ""The wall is stronger than I. He can withstand my mightiest blast."" ""Then I withdraw my request for you daughter's hand,"" replied the vole. I will marry only into the mightiest family."" And he went forthwith to the wall. Upon hearing the vole's request to marry his daughter, and the explanations thereto, the wall replied, ""You have been misled, my friend. There is a creature still mightier than I."" ""Who, then?"" asked the vole. ""He must be the strongest in the world."" ""Quite so,"" said the wall. ""It's the mouse who has a nest inside of me. No mortar can withstand her gnawing. With time she'll be the death of me. However far you go, you'll find no better wife than this little lady mouse.""

Town Mouse and Country Mouse,0112,The Story of the Town Mouse and the Field Mouse,"A mouse living in the town one day met a mouse which lived in the field. ""Where do you come from?"" asked the latter when she saw the town mouse. ""I come from yonder town,"" replied the first mouse. ""How is life going there with you?"" ""Very well, indeed. I am living in the lap of luxury. Whatever I want of sweets or any other good things is to be found in abundance in my master's house. But how are you living?"" ""I have nothing to complain of. You just come and see my stores. I have grain and nuts, and all the fruits of the tree and field in my storehouse."" The town mouse did not quite believe the story of her new friend, and, driven by curiosity, went with her to the latter's house. How great was her surprise when she found that the field mouse had spoken the truth; her garner was full of nuts and grain and other stores, and her mouth watered when she saw all the riches which were stored up there. Then she turned to the field mouse and said, ""Oh, yes, you have here a nice snug place and something to live upon, but you should come to my house and see what I have there. Your stock is as nothing compared with the riches which are mine."" The field mouse, who was rather simple by nature and trusted her new friend, went with her into the town to see what better things the other could have. She had never been into the town and did not know what her friend could mean when she boasted of her greater riches. So they went together, and the town mouse took her friend to her master's house. He was a grocer, and there were boxes and sacks full of every good thing the heart of a mouse could desire. When she saw all these riches, the field mouse said she could never have believed it, had she not seen it with her own eyes. While they were talking together, who should come in but the cat. As soon as the town mouse saw the cat, she slipped quietly behind a box and hid herself. Her friend, who had never yet seen a cat, turned to her and asked her who that gentleman was who had come in so quietly. ""Do you not know who he is? Why, he is our priest, and he has come to see me. You must go and pay your respects to him and kiss his hand. See what a beautiful glossy coat he has on, and how his eyes sparkle, and how demurely he keeps his hands in the sleeves of his coat."" Not suspecting anything, the field mouse did as she was told and went up to the cat. He gave her at once his blessing, and the mouse had no need of another after that. The cat gave her extreme unction there and then. That was just what the town mouse had intended. When she saw how well stored the home of the field mouse was, she made up her mind to trap her and to kill her, so that she might take possession of all that the field mouse had gathered up. She had learned the ways of the townspeople and had acted up to them.",Romania,"Source: M. Gaster, Rumanian Bird and Beast Stories (London: Folk-Lore Society, 1915), no. 105, pp. 311-12.",NA,NA
Town Mouse and Country Mouse,0112,The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse,"Now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely. The town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and said, ""I cannot understand, cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life."" No sooner said than done: The two mice set off for the town and arrived at the town mouse's residence late at night. ""You will want some refreshment after our long journey,"" said the polite town mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling and barking. ""What is that?"" said the country mouse. ""It is only the dogs of the house,"" answered the other. ""Only,"" said the country mouse, ""I do not like that music at my dinner!"" Just at that moment the door flew open; in came two huge mastiffs; and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. ""Good-bye, cousin,"" said the country mouse. ""What! Going so soon?"" said the other. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear."" He spares not oats or vetches: in his chaps Raisins he brings and nibbled bacon-scraps, Hoping by varied dainties to entice His town-bred guest, so delicate and nice, Who condescended graciously to touch Thing after thing, but never would take much, While he, the owner of the mansion, sate On threshed-out straw, and spelt and darnels ate. At length the townsman cries: ""I wonder how You can live here, friend, on this hill's rough brow: Take my advice, and leave these ups and downs, This hill and dale, for humankind and towns. Come now, go home with me: remember, all Who live on earth are mortal, great and small: Then take, good sir, your pleasure while you may; With life so short, 'twere wrong to lose a day."" This reasoning made the rustic's head turn round; Forth from his hole he issues with a bound, And they two make together for their mark, In hopes to reach the city during dark. The midnight sky was bending over all, When they set foot within a stately hall, Where couches of wrought ivory had been spread With gorgeous coverlets of Tyrian red, And viands piled up high in baskets lay, The relics of a feast of yesterday. The townsman does the honours, lays his guest At ease upon a couch with crimson dressed, Then nimbly moves in character of host, And offers in succession boiled and roast; Nay, like a well-trained slave, each wish prevents, And tastes before the tit-bits he presents. The guest, rejoicing in his altered fare, Assumes in turn a genial diner's air, When hark! a sudden banging of the door: Each from his couch is tumbled on the floor: Half dead, they scurry round the room, poor things, While the whole house with barking mastiffs rings. Then says the rustic: ""It may do for you, This life, but I don't like it; so adieu: Give me my hole, secure from all alarms, I'll prove that tares and vetches still have charms. Once upon a time a town mouse met a country mouse on the outskirts of a wood. The country mouse was sitting under a hazel thicket plucking nuts. ""Busy harvesting, I see,"" said the town mouse. ""Who would think of our meeting in this out-of-the-way part of the world?"" ""Just so,"" said the country mouse. ""You are gathering nuts for your winter store?"" asked the town mouse? ""I am obliged to do so if we intend having anything to live upon during the winter,"" said the country mouse. ""The husk is big and the nut full this year, enough to satisfy any hungry body,"" said the town mouse. ""Yes, you are right there,"" said the country mouse. And then she related how well she lived and how comfortable she was at home. the town mouse maintained that she was the better off, but the country mouse said that nowhere could one be so well off as in the woods and hills. The town mouse, however, declared she was best off. And as they could not agree on this point they promised to visit one another at Christmas, then they could see for themselves which was really the most comfortable. The first visit was to be paid by the town mouse. Now, although the country mouse had moved down form the mountains for the winter, the road was long and tiring, and one had to travel up hill and down dale. The snow lay thick and deep, so the town mouse found it hard work to get on, and she became both tired and hungry before she reached the end of her journey. ""How nice it will be to get some food,"" she thought. The country mouse had scraped together the best she had. There were nut kernels, polypoly and other sorts of roots, and many other good things which grow in woods and fields. She kept it all in a hole far under the ground, so the frost could not reach it, and close by was a running spring, open all the winter, so she could drink as much water as she liked. There was an abundance of all she had, and they ate both well and heartily. But the town mouse thought it was very poor fare indeed. ""One can, of course, keep boy and soul together on this,"" said she, ""but I don't think much of it. Now you must be good enough to visit me and taste what we have."" Yes, that she would, and before long she set out. The town mouse had gathered together all the scraps from the Christmas fare which the woman of the house had dropped on the floor during the holidays -- bits of cheese, butter and tallow ends, cake crumbs, pastry, and many other good things. In the dish under the ale tap she had drink enough. In fact, the place was full of all kinds of dainties. They ate and fared well. The country mouse seemed never to have had enough. She had never tasted such delicacies. But then she became thirsty, for she found the food both strong and rich, and now she wanted something to drink. ""We haven't far to go for the beer we shall drink,"" said the town mouse, and jumped upon the edge of the dish and drank until she was no longer thirsty. She did not drink too much, for she knew the Christmas beer was strong. The country mouse, however, thought the beer a splendid drink. She had never tasted anything but water, so she took one sip after another, but as she could not stand strong drink she became tipsy before she left the dish. The drink got into her head and down into her toes, and she began running and jumping about from one beer barrel to the other, and to dance and tumble about on the shelves among the cups and mugs. She squeaked and screeched as if she were both drunk and mad. About her being drunk there was very little doubt. ""You must not carry on as if you had just come from the backwoods and make such a row and noise,"" said the town mouse. ""The master of the house is a bailiff, and he is very strict indeed,"" she added. The country mouse said she didn't care either for bailiffs or beggars. But the cat sat at the top of the cellar steps, lying in wait, and heard all the chatter and noise. When the woman of the house went down to draw some beer and lifted the trapdoor, the cat slipped by into the cellar and struck its claws into the county mouse. Then there was quite another sort of dance. The town mouse slid back into her hole and sat in safety looking on, while the country mouse suddenly became sober, when she felt the claws of the cat in her back. ""Oh, my dear bailiff, of dearest bailiff, be merciful and spare my life, and I will tell you a fairy tale,"" she said. ""Well, go on,"" said the cat. ""Once upon a time there were two little mice,"" said the country mouse, squeaking slowly and pitifully, for she wanted to make the story last as long as she could. ""Then they were not lonely,"" said the cat dryly and curtly. ""And they had a steak which they were going to fry."" ""Then they could not starve,"" said the cat. ""And they put it out on the roof to cool,"" said the country mouse. ""Then they did not burn themselves,"" said the cat. ""But there came a fox and a crow and ate it all up,"" said the country mouse. ""Then I'll eat you,"" said the cat. But just at that moment the woman shut the trapdoor with a slam, which so startled the cat that she let ho her hold of the mouse. One bound and the country mouse found herself in the hole with the town mouse. From there a passage led out into the snow, and you may be sure the country mouse did not wait long before she set out homeward. ""And this is what you call living well and being best off,"" she said to the town mouse. ""Heaven preserve me from having such a fine place and such a master! Why I only just got away with my life!""",Aesop Horace Norway,"Source: Joseph Jacobs, The Fables of Aesop (London and New York: Macmillan and Company, 1894), no. 7, pp. 15-17.
