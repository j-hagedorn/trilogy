# Purpose

This repository houses tidy data of key catalogs and collections of mythology and folklore, for use in discovery of patterns using natural language processing and others statistical methods.  The following datasets are located in the `/data` sub-folder:

- `tmi`, *the Thompson Motif Index*: each row is a single motif from the index
- `atu`, *the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Tale Type Index*:
- `aat`, *Ashliman's annotated tales*:

# Replication

For the purposes of reproducibility and continual methodological improvement, we have shared the scripts used to obtain and clean these datasets in the `fetch/` subfolder.  The `tmi` dataset was built with the `fetch_motifs.R` script, the `atu` with the `fetch_taletypes.R` script, and the `aat` with the `fetch_ashliman.R`script.  Additional considerations and notes regarding the development of the datasets can be found in the `docs/` folder.

If you find issues with any of the datasets or scripts, please file an issue on this repository.  If you make improvements to the scripts, please consider submitting a pull request.
